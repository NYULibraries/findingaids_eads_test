    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn General Chemistry Kit belonged to alumnus Dr. William S. Ginell, who graduated in 1943 with a BS in Chemistry. Ginell used this chemistry kit during his time at Poly in the early 1940s. After graduating from Poly, Ginell worked as a chemist, physicist, and aerospace technician. He worked on the Manhattan Project during and after World War II, conducting research on U235 isotopes that led to the development of the atomic bomb.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The vials in the kit are organized in the same order as when they were received by the Poly Archives in 2023.   The inner lid of the kit contains a printed list of materials which should be in the kit, as well as additional elements written in at the bottom of the list. Most of the vials contain cork stoppers with numbers corresponding to the list on the lid.  Some of the vials were not organized in the divided potrion of the kit and were loose.  Some of the vials do not have numbers on the cork stopper.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Conditions Governing Access</head>
<p>The item is currently in restricted lab safety access. The kit contains vials with several toxic elements, including arsenic and potassium cyanide. The kit is held in Tandon chemical storage in Rogers Hall. Access to the kit can be provided by lab safety staff after the researcher has completed the NYU lab safety course. The kit must be viewed in a fume hood with proper personal protective gear (disposable gloves, safety glasses).</p>  </accessrestrict>
