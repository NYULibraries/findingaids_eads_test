<p>The Covid-19 Archive is a collecting project of the NYUAD Library's Archives and Special Collections. It was an initiative that was launched in April 2020 on the heels of the announcement of a global pandemic; of a campus-wide pivot to remote teaching, learning, and non-essential operations; and a city-wide "lockdown" in Abu Dhabi and many cities around the world. The Covid-19 archival initiative began as a request from NYU Abu Dhabi Vice Chancellor MariÃ«t Westermann to ensure the University was "archiving this moment." In a meeting called and led by Westermann herself, the Library and its Archives and Special Collections team were asked to help ensure that the record of the University's decisions, and its community members' experiences, would be preserved in real time.  </p><p>While acknowledging that a record of how the University responded to and experienced the Covid-19 pandemic would largely emerge from the routine preservation of administrative, operational, academic planning, and other institutional records, the team began planning more targeted approaches to documentation through outreach to Communications and Facilities departments, development of a community archive donation opportunity, and a leadership oral history project. </p><p>From spring 2020 through early 2021, similar efforts around the world were happening in tandem, including a "Covid-19 Oral History Project" led by media producers at NYU in New York (for which Westermann and some leaders at NYU Abu Dhabi were invited to participate).</p><p>The Covid-19 Archive represents collecting efforts that began in April 2020 and has continued through 2022. </p>  </bioghist>

Today we are distanced from our loved ones, from normality, from coherence. Depicting activities characteristic of this period of confinement, my work explores how these activities and social relationships have changed, adapting to the current conditions. My images show the passing of time during the long-lasting quarantine, and the human seek for connectedness and companion, now exacerbated by social distancing.</p><p>Most relationships have become long-distance as a consequence of the imposed distancing, and my goal is to represent them as anchors facing uncertainty. This series is a reminder of the social nature of humans and of the importance of relationships as sources of support, because no matter how different our days are or how far apart we are, we are all going through this tough period in our own ways and feel the need for human contact. Distanced is a meditation on how technology shortens distances, allowing for a "company" that is the only source of constancy and normality in a world that changes at the minute.</p><p>In this series I capture scenes of virtual conversations taking place during quarantine, emphasizing on the interlocutor's activities while they make each other "company". Very dissonant activities coexist in one same moment, a video call, reflecting how, despite our different ways to cope with isolation, we hold on to relationships as sources of normality in a convoluted world. I explore the themes of isolation, routine, monotony, and relationships, while attempting to make a universal statement of their importance in this prolonged isolation period.
The passing of time is also represented in these portraits through the accumulation of objects in space. This alludes to the duration of the separation and adds to the importance of the virtual company. My images put different lifestyles and activities into conversation, highlighting the sense of irony in how their natures contrast and in where and how they take place. What looks like a fancy dinner consists of canned food, studying happens in bed, one person shaves while the other exercises. Daily routines lost coherence and consistency, but company remains as the motivation to keep moving forward.</p><p>The cropping of the images removes identity from the subjects, bringing focus to the depicted activities and the contrast between them. My intention is for the viewer to picture themselves in the situation, what is more easily achieved when faces and hence identities are excluded. The cropping and the expressionless lips combine to transmit a sense of monotony, routine, and boredom of this long-lasting isolation.
Distanced is particularly dear to me as I used my boyfriend and myself as the models, therefore it is truly based on my feelings during this quarantine. I recreated our interactions to represent how the need for human contact defies social distancing. My purpose is to look back at these images one day to remember how my life was like during the pandemic and what was it that kept me afloat.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_dc39a475dc40f96d41ea1f0e088e32cf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Li, Yihao (Rayna).

However, it was detected that I had a mild fever of 37.4 degrees celcius, so I was taken to a temporary quarantine place on an ambulance! This process was so tedious because it involved a lot of waiting in rooms with no AC, blood tests, travel history interviews, and CT scans. Everyone who was in this temporary station was treated as a suspect case unless we were officially cleared after an expert meeting -- the experts/doctors were working 24/7 and in full protective gears! My journal ends with item 18, which says I have been waiting for six hours in a temporary building waiting for my expert meeting results. I had not been eating or drinking or sleeping (I have decided not to do so because taking off my mask would be unwise), and the birds had come out singing. After that, I was cleared and taken to the in-patient department for isolation (for medical purposes), and I finally got to sleep and relax. Naturally, I had forgotten to make further updates to my journey because I knew I had arrived safely.</emph> </p><p>9 (video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhgpjCazYMs

It also contrasts my pre-COVID and COVID days, as well as my life back in the Philippines last Fall 2020 and my life on campus this Spring 2021. It shows how much has changed in my life: how we used to go on desert trips and even zoos for a class excursion, being able to attend an in-person commencement instead of a virtual one, taking college classes in my high school bedroom, transitioning from using the Fitness Center to floor lounges to my house's living room, and so much more. </p><p>Lastly, this video is a summation of the different dimensions to my identity, what and who I value most in life, and the dichotomy between Janine at home and NYUAD- something akin to the experience of every other NYUAD student.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_90c5707dd5431735956d32b55744e13c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>I am submitting a hybrid of a 1-second-video compilation and the typical 'day in a life' vlog.

Each journal had a different prompt, making 20 prompts in total. In order to take part in the project, students and community members had to find the journal somewhere on campus, open it up, and scan the QR code in the journal. Each week, clues were given as to where the journals are. The QR code led to a Google Form detailing instructions and additional information about the project, as well as the prompt pertaining to that journal. Participants could then choose to submit a response anonymously or with their name. Once a response was submitted, we checked the response for safety and published it onto the Website on the corresponding page with the prompt. The Website allows for all to see all prompts that we have had and read all responses that have been approved. For each prompt, one response was chosen to win a prize. </p><p>Duration: 4 weeks; 1 week at a time</p><p>Project mission: In recent times, we have found it increasingly harder to connect with one another and to take time to reflect. With the 'Shared Stories' project, we hope to bring the NYUAD community together by sharing some stories and experiences that have shaped us and made us who we are, individually and collectively, today. The project also served as an incentive to encourage community members to be more active and to search for the journals around campus.</p><p>Project website: https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/wellness-journaling-project/home </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8ad75efe83f03ed040197e84e5dca528" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hamilton, Shona.

It felt like a really bad flu, I was shivering with a fever for days and couldn't stop coughing. I learned I had Covid because I was tested upon arrival at the airport. After months and months of only knowing the "green" or the "grey" colors of the Al Hosn app, I finally saw the "red," indicating I tested positive. These screenshots show me at red and then at green, and include the explanation and instructions about what I was to do after testing positive, including the procedure of quarantining. I quarantined at home for 10 days, testing myself with at-home Covid tests until I no longer was positive. I then went for an official test at the local testing center at Galleria Mall, which led to me going back to the green. I appreciated the efforts of the UAE government to create a mechanism to efficiently track Covid cases and provide a way for the population to move through the experience of contracting the virus in an honest and responsible way. While some may have found it to be an inconvenience, I appreciated it and was happy to follow protocols, which were created to help keep our communities as safe as possible.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_4c3953dcc981979a5afbd092f30f09b8"><head>Biographical / Historical</head><p>Lauren Kata is a member of the academic librarian team in Archives and Special Collections and works with the NYUAD University Archives.
