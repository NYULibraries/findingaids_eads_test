<p>Established in 2014, The NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) Art Gallery is the Gulf's first and only university gallery with a program of scholarly and experimental museum exhibitions. The program seeks to map new territories and ideas through presenting exhibitions by internationally established artists, curators, and scholars at its main space. Its auxiliary venue, the Project Space, is an exhibition laboratory for the university community, and for emerging artists and curators. Situated within NYU Abu Dhabi, the community of which hails from over 115 countries, The Art Gallery organizes free public programs and guided tours in conjunction with its groundbreaking exhibitions. It also produces scholarly publications, which are a core part of its curatorial frame and reflect its academic mission. Collectively, with the Gallery's Reading Room, these welcoming, intimate spaces open up artistic opportunities and initiate regional and international dialogue.</p><p>The Galleries Department oversees all exhibition activity on campus, including the main gallery (for museum exhibitions), the Project Space (for experimental projects), and the Christo Award (for emerging UAE artists).</p><p>
