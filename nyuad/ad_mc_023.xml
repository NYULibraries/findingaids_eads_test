<p>New York University Abu Dhabi was established in partnership with the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and began offering undergraduate courses beginning in the Fall of 2010. While plans for a main campus on Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Island were approved in March 2009, in December of that year an interim Downtown Campus (DTC) opened in Abu Dhabi city, and welcomed its inaugural class of 148 students in September 2010. </p><p>The NYUAD Oral History Project was a 2014 collaboration between the NYUAD Library and the Office of Human Resources. Project team members included Library Director, Virginia Danielson; Librarian for Research and Reference Services, Ilka Datig; Media Specialist and Videographer, Rebecca Pittam; and Tamu Al Islam, who at the time of the project was Director of HR Services, Strategy, and Engagement.</p><p>The subjects of this oral history collection are university students, faculty, and staff who were present during the first four years of operations. NYUAD community members were informally polled, and those who were identified as individuals "with interesting and unique knowledge of the early days" were invited to participate in a 30-minute to 1-hour video-recorded interview session. The resulting set of interviews represents those who agreed and were available. A first round of interviewing took place during the Spring 2014 semester, weeks ahead of the University's first commencement ceremonies. Additional interviews were recorded during Summer and Fall 2014. </p><p>Interviews were conducted in dedicated campus spaces in DTC, and later Saadiyat, with Ilka Datig, Rebecca Pittam, and Tamu Al-Islam (and sometimes others) also present as interviewers and facilitators. </p><p>Questions asked covered a range of topics, including questions about impressions, key moments, the physical environment, and individual memories. </p><p>The project formed a beginning effort to document the origins of NYUAD, with the goal "to begin the preservation of materials and memories related to the early days of NYUAD before they are lost or forgotten." Early project documentation notes this project as the initial effort to build and grow a University Archives, as participants were invited to add to other materials such as "yearbooks, born-digital items from social media, a collection of media coverage from both print and online sources, and any other memorabilia to which we can gain access."  </p><p><emph render="italic">Reference: (from original invitation letter to potential interviewees.)</emph>

They describe work on important projects like the Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Scholars Program and the NYUAD Institute. The former gave them an opportunity to meet leaders in the political field and engage with Emirati students. For the Institute, they recall conducting extensive outreach to the community which was done manually throughout the city of Abu Dhabi at beaches and other locations.  They also mention the importance of a connected Arab diaspora and Arab networks to sustaining the relationship between the Institute and the community. Many other instances also required a very hands-on approach on their part whether that was writing welcome cards for visitors or setting up the stage for a particular event. The pair also played the role of hosts to many groups and individuals who visited the institution as part of the recruitment process or for other programs. They discuss the adventures of learning to live in Abu Dhabi, experiencing the environment, local culture, religion and locating necessary spaces such as laundromats and supermarkets.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref2_gw0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview with Jordan Schulze by Ilka Datig (48:00)</unittitle><unitid>ADMC023_ref2</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">48 minutes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">130 Gigabytes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014" type="inclusive">27 Apr 2014</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_26107b4d35895bb34e7618eaca257cc0" label="Moving Images" type="object">ADMC023_ref2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ee0a6604f4922b9292245cb95ebbd4a9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded session with Jordan Schulze, NYU Abu Dhabi Class of 2014 senior student at the time of the interview, by Ilka Datig, former Reference and Research Librarian, NYUAD Library. </p><p>In this session, Jordan Schulze shares his experience of applying to NYUAD while primarily planning to join the U.S. Air Force Academy.

He mentions his complicated relationship with the city and the UAE as a whole because of the weather, differing perspectives on labour issues and volunteering, as well as the fast pace of growth. He says that moments of connection including community open mic events, thanksgiving celebrations and dancing in the rain were able to ease his difficult experience at the university. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref14_r0q" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview with Musbah Dilsebo Ormago by Ilka Datig (24:00)</unittitle><unitid>ADMC023_ref14</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">24 minutes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">65.19 Gigabytes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014" type="inclusive">11 May 2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_a518e8b4d8b4a342b80fc43381bc1d2f" label="Moving Images" type="object">ADMC023_ref14</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ab281ffac6df9b05c4e0a66cba566a1a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded session with Musbah Dilsebo, NYU Abu Dhabi Class of 2014 senior student at the time of the interview, by Ilka Datig, former Reference and Research Librarian, NYUAD Library. </p><p>Musbah Dilsebo reflects on his time at NYUAD in his final semester at the university.

His introduction to the University entailed feelings of culture shock especially in the student-professor relationship and highly demanding classes. He offers insight to the beginnings of NYUAD Athletics as they formed a collegiate soccer team which Musbah fondly remembers brought major attention to him from the student body. He mentions the difficulties of writing, homesickness and becoming used to having academic weaknesses. The inaugural student government constitution, which Musbah helped to draft, is mentioned alongside the importance of the student body and NYUAD as an institution for the future of global education. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref15_iea" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview with Amani Alsaied by Ilka Datig (29:00)</unittitle><unitid>ADMC023_ref15</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">29 minutes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">78.09 Gigabytes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014" type="inclusive">11 May 2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_8e4f93345ab5205fe438e62c2643c1b9" label="Moving Images" type="object">ADMC023_ref15</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ba5e6d76b93339341e687ccba38a3159"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded session with Amani Alsaeid, NYU Abu Dhabi Class of 2014 senior student at the time of the interview, by Ilka Datig, former Reference and Research Librarian, NYUAD Library. </p><p>In this interview Amani talks about the difficulties and high points of her time at NYU Abu Dhabi.

He describes his first majlis meeting with Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed which lasted much longer than the planned 15 minutes, and began the inception of NYU Abu Dhabi as a full portal campus rather than a study away site. Noteworthy is the importance of the NYU Abu Dhabi Institute and the Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Scholars Program to the development of the institution in Abu Dhabi. John describes the Institute as a program of conferences which ultimately stimulated intellectual life in the Abu Dhabi community and gave world-class academics an introduction to the city. The latter led to the local community's trust in the NYUAD project and illustrated the team's commitment to the success of the institution. He touches on memorable points like navigating cultural difference, the first Candidate Weekend, and the changing nature of meetings with His Highness Sheikh Mohamed and Albert Bloom, the first Vice-Chancellor of NYUAD.</p><p>[*Split into two separate interviews, to facilitate a break.]</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref19_qfe" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview with PJ Henry by Ilka Datig (52:00)</unittitle><unitid>ADMC023_ref19</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">52 minutes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">144.92 Gigabytes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014" type="inclusive">25 May 2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_93827f59915a4ad85bc66a4b75294551" label="Moving Images" type="object">ADMC023_ref19</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1cb6855e6ea0b4fb88827ed22333bdc1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded session with Associate Professor of Psychology PJ Henry by Ilka Datig, former Reference and Research Librarian, NYUAD Library.</p><p>In this interview, Associate Professor PJ Henry recounts his journey coming to work at NYU Abu Dhabi.

He discusses challenges adjusting to the smaller, more relational teaching environment, conducting psychological research in the UAE, and adapting to the rapidly evolving institutional environment.

He discusses extensively the interface between NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU in New York - the assuredness of building off their model and the challenges of modifying that model to the Abu Dhabi context, for example with networking, which is more difficult and expensive in the UAE. He also mentions the challenges of working two shifts, one in the morning with the Abu Dhabi team, then at night with his New York contacts. Yousif talks about the obstacles with the establishment of the campus which included problems with contractors, setting up the IT infrastructure and negotiating with the government with regard to academic freedom. The IT system was the main focus of his responsibilities including the recruitment of staff, and setting up operations at the Downtown Campus and the new Saadiyat Campus. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref22_f5i" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview with Praveen Kumar by Ilka Datig (45:00)</unittitle><unitid>ADMC023_ref22</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">45 minutes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">123.14 Gigabytes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014" type="inclusive">24 Jun 2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_3e31c848775db24e0544f31b0d05fb1b" label="Moving Images" type="object">ADMC023_ref22</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_09db34a27e54c4b3a5c90d9fbea36ae8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded session with Praveen Kumar, Associate Project Director for Planning, Delivery, and Transition for the Saadiyat Campus, by Ilka Datig, former Reference and Research Librarian, NYUAD Library.</p><p>In this interview, Praveen Kumar shares anecdotes from his time as the Project Director of Planning, Delivery and Transition to the Saadiyat Campus.

The inception of the university was based on core principles which included the fostering of an organic connection between the New York and Abu Dhabi campuses, becoming a leader of university education in the region, and forging a deep connection with the Abu Dhabi community. Hilary describes the 'giant leaps' of constructing the Downtown Campus, and later the Saadiyat campus, both of which signified the importance of growth, change and adaptability to the life of NYU Abu Dhabi. Notable challenges included the initial recruitment of impressive and qualified faculty to this startup university, as well as making strong connections with the Emirati community. Both of these hurdles were quickly overcome as world-class faculty became a magnet for others, and the early participants of the Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Scholars Program became ambassadors for the University. Hilary fondly remembers her first Candidate Weekend, with speeches by John Sexton and a first cohort that was a microcosm of the world. Her interview ends with a look forward to the growth of the community in the years to come, shaping NYU and Abu Dhabi. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref25_nqx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview with Jennifer Gerdes by Ilka Datig (30:00)</unittitle><unitid>ADMC023_ref25</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">30:05 minutes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">94.8 Gigabytes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014" type="inclusive">30 Sep 2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_ece55a8a7f0a5222f0ecde1cc75b2042" label="Moving Images" type="object">ADMC023_ref25</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3389efbcd3cae5d5b940b61a4d6fd2ba"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Jennifer reflects on her time at NYU Abu Dhabi which started with her position as an academic coach to the first cohort of students in 2010.

Her introduction to NYU's initial interest in Abu Dhabi was through the Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Scholars Program which she helped to bring to its current level of prestige. Tamu talks of the early days of the institution when the support within the team was integral to maintaining focus and camaraderie, as well as beginning to understand and experience the city. Points of contention among the team included dealing with the lack of infrastructure, becoming acquainted with local practices different to one's own and the relationship between NYU and the Abu Dhabi campus. Tamu also refers extensively to the growth of NYU Abu Dhabi from what she calls a startup to its stage in 2014, moving to the Downtown Campus, the interaction of students and faculty, growing school population and substantial academic preparation which has contributed to the continued development of the school.</p></scopecontent></c></dsc>
