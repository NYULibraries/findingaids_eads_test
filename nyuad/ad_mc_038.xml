    <head>Content Description</head>
<p>The Guiliano Garavini collection consists of digital copies of meeting minutes of OPEC Conference meetings, with other selected attached documents, beginning with the first conference in 1960, and extending through the 80th meeting of the Conference, in December 1986.  Includes copies of OPEC resolutions and press releases dating from 1960 to 1997.  Digital copies exist as PDF files.  Files were obtained by Garavini during the research and writing of his book, "The Rise and Fall of OPEC in the Twentieth Century."</p><p>The minutes of the meetings, arranged chronologically by meeting date, show the evolution of the organization and development of its policies, as it dealt with questions of how best to maximize the position of its member states as oil producers in the developing world in response to consumer demand from industralized nations.  From the earliest meetings, topics represented included attempts to coordinate pricing of crude oil, how to address the question of price differentials by type of crude and region where it was produced, the nationalization of oil companies in some member states, the role of national oil companies in member states in response to outside oil companies, and whether to set production ceilings applicable to all member states, in order to strengthen the position of member states and to stabilize prices to their benefit, among other recurring issues.  </p><p>The challenges faced by the cartel are documented these minutes through events and trends that members responded to, such as competition from increasing production by non-member nations (such as that from the development of North Sea oil fields by Norway and the United Kingdom in the 1970s), the oil embargo in response to the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, the devaluation of the U.S. dollar (the currency in which crude oil was priced and traded), fluctuating consumer demand, inflation, and other economic trends.  </p>  </scopecontent>

At a special session held in the Iranian Senate, the conference was addressed by Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlavi, who addressed the urgency of implementing this resolution to address price imbalances among oil-producing countries, and to rectify the drop in oil prices among some producing countries, such as the nations of the Gulf region, including Iran.

The latter report detailed the efforts of committee members to reach out to the governments of several non-OPEC oil producing countries (Norway, Mexico, Malaysia, Brunei, USSR, Angola, Egypt) in order to discuss how they could induce them to follow policies in terms of production and pricing that were more in alignment with those of OPEC.  The bulk of the meeting though concerned discussions of production ceilings, quotas, and pricing of member states within OPEC.
Also included is the text of the opening speech by Andrej Ocvirk, president of the Federal Committee for Energy and Industry of Yugoslavia.</p></odd><phystech id="aspace_ca6ce6d462995143c7b4cb0e4ddac047"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>PDF, 137 pages, 9 MB.</p></phystech></c><c id="aspace_5abda0e565b6055ad628e8a58feccf25" level="file"><did><unittitle>78th meeting (2):  Minutes of the Seventy-Eighth Meeting of the Conference (part II), Geneva</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1986-07-28/1986-08-05" type="inclusive">July 28 - August 5, 1986</unitdate><container id="aspace_5da1064ba080b8e168bb58a246b4e6eb" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">E-records AD_MC_038</container><container id="aspace_a62474ca408ade557da34bc71b98c437" parent="aspace_5da1064ba080b8e168bb58a246b4e6eb" type="object">E-records AD_MC_038_104</container></did><odd id="aspace_5f688e42b03678b71171cc66ef6c9a34"><head>Topics covered:</head><p>Delegations in attendance:  Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela.
