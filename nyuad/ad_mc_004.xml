    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>One of the NYUAD Library's most frequently used collections, the Capstone Archives is the university's accumulating collection of submitted Capstone senior research projects, beginning with the Class of 2014 and continuing to the present. Submitting their senior Capstone project is a required step for students to complete their undergraduate education at NYUAD and collect their diplomas. </p><p>The collection is a living, growing digital collection that is being preserved by Archives and Special Collections, in partnership with the Library's Center for Digital Scholarship. </p><p>The collection represents a diverse sampling of the research, innovation, and creative endeavors of NYUAD undergraduate students. </p><p>Project files consist primarily of text-based essays. As the projects represent all majors across disciplines, a broad range of topics and research areas are explored across the collection. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Conditions Governing Access</head>
<p>Archived Capstone Projects that are open and unrestricted are available for viewing via the Capstone Archives Online Collection. </p><p>Student creators are given the option to restrict their project for a period of time, and some choose to do so. There are a variety of reasons why this might happen. For example, some students may wish to continue their research beyond their time at NYU Abu Dhabi, and are not yet ready to make it public. Other students simply opt not to make their research project open. </p><p>Administration of restricted projects and documentation around student author permissions is managed by Archives and Special Collections staff and follows a rights management timeline. </p>  </accessrestrict>
