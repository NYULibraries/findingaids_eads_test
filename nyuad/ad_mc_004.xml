The archival colletion includes project files primarily comprised of text-based essays, but may also include filmed performances, interactive media files, and supplemental documents submitted by NYU Abu Dhabi graduating seniors, from 2014 to the present. Submitting their senior Capstone project is a required step for students to complete their undergraduate education at NYUAD and collect their diplomas. Users may access the projects by contacting the Library's Archives and Special Collections staff, who will provide temporary, view-only access to open files.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Conducting Capstone research is a significant part of the undergraduate experience at NYU Abu Dhabi, which every student will engage during their fourth year. Marking the final step before graduating, the year-long research endeavor may result in pursuing an important research question or creative idea, which may take the form of an historical narrative, musical composition, performance, invention, documented experiment, scholarly thesis, or other form appropriate to the student's goals.</p><p>To prepare for their Capstone research, all students enroll in a Capstone seminar, led by assigned faculty in each major or program. Some student research, particularly within the Engineering Division, may be conceptualized as a group project, and may build upon research that was conducted by members of an earlier Class. No matter the pursuit, as the program description states, the student is in charge and challenged "to enter unmapped terrain and to extend oneself in making knowledge, reframing conventional approaches to an issue or creating something new."</p><p>At the end of each spring semester, each of NYU Abu Dhabi's four academic divisions acknowledge and celebrate Capstone Projects in a variety of ways. These celebrations themselves have become traditions. For example, the Division of Arts and Humanities hosts an annual Capstone Festival; the Engineering Division hosts a special website showcase; and various programs and departments across campus celebrate with senior dinners, acknowledgement, and congratulations events. An annual Capstone Projects anthology is also produced and widely shared. As a condition of graduation (as of 2018), students must submit their project to the Library, where the collections is managed as part of the University Archives.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>One of the most frequently used collections of the University Archives, the Capstone Archives is the University's accumulating collection of submitted senior research projects, beginning with the Class of 2014 and continuing to the present. The collection is a living, growing digital collection that is being preserved collaboratively by Archives and Special Collections and the Center for Digital Scholarship, in the NYU Abu Dhabi Library.  </p><p>Organized into series by academic division, and major within, the project files consist primarily of text-based essays. Some projects also include other products and deliverables such as copies of films, as well as filmed performances; interactive media files (such as programmed Virtual Reality and video game software files); and supplemental documents such as photographs of installations and prototypes.  As the projects represent all majors across disciplines, a broad range of topics and research areas are explored across the collection. </p><p>In some cases, particularly in the Engineering Division, Capstone projects are group projects, or may continue research that was begun by a previous group under direction of the same faculty member. </p><p>Upon submission, students write and provide their own summary abstracts of the project, which are included in the container list of each open project described. </p><p>Student creators are given the option to restrict their project for a period of time, and some do choose to do so. There are a variety of reasons why this might happen. For example, some students may wish to continue their research beyond their time at NYU Abu Dhabi, and are not yet ready to make it public. This finding aid represents only unrestricted and open projects. Administration of restricted files is managed by Archives and Special Collections. </p><p>In addition to project files, which make up the core of the collection, a series of "Other Capstone Documentation" includes records such as video recordings of students describing their projects; photographs of installations and prototypes taken by campus photographers (as opposed to those submitted by students); and ephemera from Capstone Festivals and events. Although intellectually part of the Capstone Archives, digital content in this series is stored and managed separately, maintained as digital assets by the Center for Digital Scholarship and unprocessed, but available for reviewing upon request and with guidance from the archivist. </p><p>This collection is open to the public, and by far its most frequent user group includes NYUAD juniors and seniors who seek out the collection as they embark on their own research. Student researchers browse and read past Capstone projects, for example, for inspiration; to gauge if an idea has been explored before; to carry on previous research; or, as part of a literature review to integrate into the project essay.</p>  </scopecontent>
  <arrangement id="aspace_a7ef4cb7d523275334690dc9e0ed8895">
    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection is arranged into several series, beginning with the four academic divisions. Within those series, files are arranged into sub-series by major. Within each major, projects are then listed chronologically by submission year, and alphabetically by last name of student within. </p><p>For group projects with multiple authors, the project is arranged alphabetically by last name, although all names of participants are present in the title. </p><p>As each project is considered a unique project, all files will have a component unique identifier, which is the Capstone Project number or "CP#."</p><p>A fifth series, "Other Capstone Documentation," is unprocessed as of the publication of this finding aid, but arrangement of files internally correspond to Division and CP#.  </p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>Capstone Projects and their accompanying supplemental documents are uploaded to an administrative server directly by students, which is managed by NYUAD IT. Instructions and a form are accessible via the NYU Abu Dhabi intranet. Submitted projects are then transferred to Library repositories by the archivists for integration and preservation as part of the University Archives. </p><p>Other Capstone documentation is acquired through various means directy from individual programs, and stewarded by the Library's digital content specialists in the Center for Digital Scholarship. </p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Conditions Governing Access</head>
<p>Archived Capstone Projects that are open and unrestricted are available for viewing onsite in the Archives and Special Collections reading room, or temporary view-only remote access may be arranged. Each Capstone Project has a unique identifier defined by year of submission and a four-digit number (ex: 2019-0001). When requesting access, this number is needed for retrieval of files.</p>  </accessrestrict>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Processed by Lauren Kata, with assistance from Maria Chaves and student assistants Ian Bryce Hoyt and Muhammad Shehryar Hamid. An original container list for 2014-2016 projects was created in Archivists' Toolkit by Nicholas Martin.</p><p>During the spring and summer of 2020, a reprocessing project was undertaken to accommodate publishing a public finding aid. Work involved the application of consistent naming conventions, removal of Personally Identifiable Information and implementation of a new "CP#" as component unique identifier, as well as a new arrangement scheme by academic division and major to provide a more accessible browse experience for users. At this time, quality control of the digital files was also conducted, preparing them for future and ongoing preservation processing. </p>  </processinfo>

The once-powerful Arab clove planters had lost much of their political influence over the course of the 19th century, and many were heavily in debt to Indian moneylenders. The development of this situation is vital to understanding how colonial policies were implemented and how Zanzibaris navigated the changes which occurred in the early colonial period. This thesis analyzes the current state of scholarship on Zanzibar's early colonial history, and argues that there has been a tendency for studies to rely too heavily on casting 1890 as a turning point, which has the effect of downplaying continuities between pre-colonial and early colonial processes of economic, political, and social change. I advocate for a rethinking of temporal boundaries in future research on this subject, and I examine two processes, the slave trade and the British exploitation of Indian merchants, which demonstrate the theoretical benefits that can be derived from crossing the imagined border between the pre-colonial and colonial eras.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Colonialism History Middle East</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Oman</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">Zanzibar</geogname><subject source="lcsh">British Empire</subject><subject source="lcsh">Agriculture/Farms</subject><subject source="lcsh">Enslavement</subject><subject source="lcsh">Debt</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref415_s78" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hennig, Clare Elizabeth. <emph render="italic">The 'Red Line' Of Journalism: Shifting Visions Of The Media In The UAE.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0004</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_efa67b61d5163fde5e2565531ef777ff">This project focuses on the gap between the vision of journalism in the UAE and the position of the press in practice.

Drawing on fieldwork conducted in Jordan over the summer of 2018 I argue that the Jordan Compact failed to reach target outcomes due to a number of structural implementation challenges, including policy decontextualization and a competitive development architecture. In terms of the empowerment of Syrian refugees, however, the failure of the Jordan Compact was not so much a question of flawed implementation as it was of the "anti-politics" of development-based refugee policy. Syrians in Jordan do not just suffer from "underdevelopment," but also from a weak protection regime that circumvents the question of durable solutions and facilitates exploitation, discrimination, and abuse. In this way, a critique of the Jordan Compact should first and foremost highlight the political failure of the compact to strengthen refugee protection and offer a durable, long-term solution to the refugee crisis.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2d89fc19b6842e66396c9cc544d5269b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mikhalkovich, Alena. <emph render="italic">Perceptions and Practices of Emirati visitors at Louvre Abu Dhabi </emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0027</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_78efee41f85f7c910ae7c7606c55efa4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_96ebafcd5cf993072903023832dcea00" parent="aspace_78efee41f85f7c910ae7c7606c55efa4" type="folder">2019-0027</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_77a87f29a1bb37be6a6b54958d853952"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This research studies Louvre Abu Dhabi and the "Roads of Arabia" exhibition, its role in nation-building and UAE branding, and its reception by the local population. Firstly, I examine the museum's reconciliation of local and universal heritage, the UAE nation-building and branding. Secondly, I study Emiratis' reception of such big Western-style museum projects. I argue that Louvre Abu Dhabi brand becomes regionalized and appropriated for UAE nation-branding and regional diplomacy. At the same time, I demonstrate that Emiratis, despite appreciation of the universal narrative, view the museum primarily as a branding project and a tourist-oriented establishment, disapproving its emphasis on the Western culture and insufficient reach out to the local population. Hence, Emiratis desire bigger representation of the local heritage at Louvre, seeing it as worthy of being part of the universal narrative. In addition, I argue that Louvre Abu Dhabi apart from mitigating the nation-building and branding contradictions, gives a way for a young educated upper- and middle-class Emiratis to practice and express their elitist cultural identity in contradistinction to the older, less educated, and religiously conservative Emiratis.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e17da27ac383576a4a85b43a2447fc6c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Plaschke, Jakob. <emph render="italic">LGBT+-Activism in Tunisia: Brokering Progressive Politics Independently</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0001</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_6c560abd9339a324dc55dbe5330e6799" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_18556f40867ce05e7021ccd1a3459f03" parent="aspace_6c560abd9339a324dc55dbe5330e6799" type="folder">2020-0001</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ef5d7c163e236e35c87cae7374ba4831"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Based on two fieldwork trips and extensive interviewing, this capstone looks broadly at how LGBT+-activist organizations function in the political context that is contemporary Tunisia. The capstone consists of four main chapters, each contributing separately to the existing literature on the topic, but also coming together as a whole. The first chapter is a historical account of LGBT+-activism in Tunisia, identifying important periods and ruptures. The second chapter is a contemporary mapping of the Tunisian LGBT+-activist community, focused on organizations' differences, interplay and conflicts. The third chapter argues that Tunisian LGBT+-activists are doing a good job at navigating complex political structures to their benefit and also details the concrete work being carried out. The final chapter argues that if Tunisian LGBT+-activists continue to self-evaluate and improve their ability to assert influence, they have a unique chance to become brokers of broad political alliances over progressive social policies. This is in part due to the fact that LGBT+-rights are not a politically polarizing issue and in part because the organizations are not tainted by affiliations with the Ben Ali dictatorship.	</p><p>Queer, activism, LGBT, Tunisia, North Africa, MENA, politics, history, Tunis</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_22c020d7ee7edf53d56ad50756907f9a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Young Kim, Ji. <emph render="italic">Never كافي: Understanding Emirati Youth Subculture development in Abu Dhabi Specialty Cafes</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0002</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_668e32f2a6175190437d58f1bc457cc5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0e55f554f7c945f89c493a54e0639c78" parent="aspace_668e32f2a6175190437d58f1bc457cc5" type="folder">2020-0002</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a80901f8c26d4839b2f9619b29b11ce8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>With the increased number of specialty cafes in Abu Dhabi, Emirati youth have appropriated cafes as a space of sociability. Through field interviews and ethnographic research, this paper investigates how the influx of specialty cafes has developed the practice of sociability between young Emiratis, and how these spaces of sociability affect their modes of identification. I argue that Abu Dhabi youth transform specialty cafes into a young people's place that is socially acceptable while encouraging them to expand their social circle beyond their family. By doing so, they not only create a subculture inside this social space but also reconstruct social norms to fit the category of the youth. I discuss the themes of anonymity, privacy, gender hierarchy and the performance of identity. Just like the title indicates, there is "never enough" layers and information on how cafes can be understood Abu Dhabi.	</p><p>Abu Dhabi, Youth Culture, Specialty Cafe, Anonymity, Subculture, Gender</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e2e69707b792e014da7e076d668f7bf5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ammagui, Nada. <emph render="italic">Aesthetic Assertion: Taste-Making at the Sharjah Biennial</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0003</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_0426579db9718d977621c1d75fbb7de3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_3e21739893691acf2e6a9526e513bacb" parent="aspace_0426579db9718d977621c1d75fbb7de3" type="folder">2020-0003</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5f1ee58a5c87f7db20fb8cfed9e2220d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Art has long served as a platform for cultural exploration, representation, and exchange, particularly in the space of international art fairs and biennials (Althuser 2008; Kirshenblatt-Gimblatt 2007). From souqs and Kalba Nature Reserve to canopied saris and dancing chess pieces, the Sharjah Biennial, the first art biennial in the Arabian Penninsula, takes visitors on a physical trip through Sharjah and an ideological journey through global contemporary artistic forms and themes. How does the Sharjah Biennial's juxtaposition of local traditions and internationally relevant concerns shape local aesthetic tastes? How do spatial and aesthetic discourses affect these tastes? This capstone paper investigates the effect of these discourses, grounded in local historical narratives, on the creation of aesthetic preferences. With this research, I challenge hegemonic rhetoric on modernization and identity retro-formation in Gulf art scenes by arguing that the Sharjah Biennial draws on local histories to shape its future. I fill a gap in contemporary art and biennial literature by offering the first academic paper on the Sharjah Biennial and by shedding light on the roles of art events in the shaping of local aesthetics, contributing to a wider understanding of contemporary Gulf cultures.	</p><p>Sharjah, UAE, contemporary art, biennials, aesthetics, anthropology, habitus, milieu, exhibition</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c9398406cb0f0f1c5b7f1321bf4a5bf3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Garcia, Sussan. <emph render="italic">Kafala and Binding are Synonyms: A Consequence of Capitalist Class Formation in Ethnic Regimes in the United Arab Emirates and Israel</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0004</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_4613c4c0d94716fc97dfc4384539ccc1" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ef129791564e6febd90568042d4a1f50" parent="aspace_4613c4c0d94716fc97dfc4384539ccc1" type="folder">2020-0004</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_edbfbe40a4921b9cac964be7edd500d7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This capstone questions the lack of nuance present in the critiques aimed at the kafala system I observed as a student at Abu Dhabi, which was highlighted during my time in Israel, which has a remarkably similar binding system.

I conclude that universal forces behind capitalist class formation in these ethnic regimes led to the creation of their contemporary labor migration regimes; this is further reinforced by their different scales of labor migration population, which speaks to the longevity of their respective labor migration regime. This capstone compiles labor migration histories of Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and establishes one of the few robust comparisons of these two countries.	</p><p>United Arab Emirates, Israel, kafala, migration, labor migration, binding</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_002442203dc14cb1ad679f7756f4b870" level="file"><did><unittitle>Duborg, Christian. <emph render="italic">Ideologies of Persuasion: an Examination of the Political Rhetoric of Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egyptian and International Media, 1958-1965</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0005</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_afd7572fd3bdfe5c49541d4b745ee8ca" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_db8132926f297d73eb8eda81d6f39b53" parent="aspace_afd7572fd3bdfe5c49541d4b745ee8ca" type="folder">2020-0005</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4f105346a4938a2bcaa305889cd43cf0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The goal of this capstone is to use a case study of Nasser's Egypt to examine how governments use the media for political persuasion.

Abu Dhabi's biggest legacy in the realm of the arts may be the introduction of innovative museums like the Louvre Abu Dhabi (2015), the Norman Foster designed Zayed National Museum (2016), and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi (2017).  However, prior to their public openings a need exists to expose the general community to "museum culture." To address that process, I have completed working on an arts education initiative that focused on building a museum going society. I have worked in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Cultural Authority and Abu Dhabi Education Council on this project and I have developed and conducted workshops with private and international schools in the emirate for 150 students. The works produced during these workshops were exhibited from May 4th, 2014 until May 25th, 2014 at the Manarat Al Saadiyat.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Workshops</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Exhibitions</genreform><subject source="lcsh">Museums</subject><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Community</subject><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Art</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d847d93919f45b7f6f782bd7af674063" level="file"><did><unittitle>Flores, Cassandra Elizabeth. <emph render="italic">The Not-So-New Kid: The Changing Relationship to National Representation in the National Pavilion of the United Arab Emirates at the Venice Biennale, 2009-2013</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0013</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_abf6ae9fa0364c082a8b6c16f5420c06" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_4fa2882feab5f0411d5a439df03390f5" parent="aspace_abf6ae9fa0364c082a8b6c16f5420c06" type="folder">2014-0013</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2ba24ef49f4e501b0dd568400ab3203c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Visual Arts. This paper explores the brief history of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the Venice Biennale. It addresses the recent and rapid development of the UAE's cultural infrastructure and the history and significance of the Venice Biennale art fair. Due to its continued use of national pavilions, the Venice Biennale acts as a space in which art is presented within a narrative of national identity and representation. However, in recent years many countries have shown pavilions that question or reject the nation-based format. In its time at the Venice Biennale the UAE Pavilion has demonstrated a shift away from overt and largely promotional national representation, in turn towards a critical engagement with the country's history and development, and finally towards an examination of nationhood itself. The alignment of this transformation with prevalent Biennale trends may imply, particularly within the context of the Venice Biennale, a greater appreciation for and emphasis on art on the part of the UAE.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref35_pmi" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hunt, James Baxter IV. <emph render="italic">D-WR</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0017</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_751d068b233ae430202c0f88d8468b28" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_dc9c08f768f612ee14b311eba06303fa" parent="aspace_751d068b233ae430202c0f88d8468b28" type="folder">2014-0017</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_20cc7f737cc6fe69e19797c4748ca691"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Visual Arts, Political Science<lb/>Abstract: D-WR encompasses the globe.

Both the canvas and the animation, shown side by side, serve to answer questions about both the formation and experience of cultural memory, by revealing in the absolute terms of geography the indeterminate movement of human recollection.

The first half of the 17th century is characterized by a monochromatic trend, using restrained colors and subject matter due to an economic slump and Calvinist ideology.  During second half of the 17th century, due to trade and Dutch colonialism, rare goods and luxurious commodities pour into the Netherlands, and become objects of admiration and become subject of the pronkstillleven genre (show-off still life). With this surplus of wealth, a consumerist attitude is born instilling an urge to conspicuously display one's wealth. I analyze the contrast between the two trends and discuss how and why this change took place. Through the analysis of four works of still life comparisons and contrasts will be drawn that mark these opposing artistic trends.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><genreform source="lcsh">Still-life painting |y 17th century</genreform><genreform source="lcsh">Still-life painting, Dutch</genreform><geogname source="lcsh">The Netherlands</geogname><genreform source="lcsh">Art |x History</genreform><subject source="lcsh">Consumption (Economics)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Seventeenth century</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref306_wwv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Karpova, Olga. <emph render="italic">ДОМА | DOMA</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0018</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_931cb0048b1f69ae6aaf383d8c93e117" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_8952950dd37695cad757fcc5028b757f" parent="aspace_931cb0048b1f69ae6aaf383d8c93e117" type="folder">2015-0018</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_be806f7df555fc6a6eaaa2e245b8c25e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Visual Arts<lb/>Abstract: Home.

Abstract: This paper goes through a chronological documentation of my capstone project, Psychogeographica. This is a yearlong research project that delves into my personal experience of Abu Dhabi, and particularly how this experience involved me feeling alienated by the space of the city, but not knowing exactly why this reaction had occurred. I recognize that this was because I felt no semblance of time passing – there was no evidence of decomposition or aging within the buildings, streets, sense of place and consequently within myself as I existed within the city.

Online Project. Abstract: "Institutional critique" is a term used to describe art that is reflective about its positions in institutions and systems within the art world. Institutional critique typically takes the practices that allow art to be exhibited, circulated, exchanged, and sold as the subject of the artwork. This kind of artwork encourages the viewer to reflect on the idea of "the institution" by addressing it both directly and indirectly. 
This exhibition explores three contemporary examples of artists engaging in institutional critique and considers their artwork in relationship to one another, in an historical framework. The exhibition investigates the methods used by artists to identify and address different institutions. This exhibition is a curatorial Capstone project. As a student project, it lies outside the typical framework of "the art institution." Still, the university can be understood as a cultural institution. Thus this project is, ultimately, an experiment in curating institutional critique from within an institution.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Institutional Critique (Art movement)</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Art |x History</genreform><subject source="lcsh">Contemporary art</subject><subject source="lcsh">Curating</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Exhibitions</genreform></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref412_rzt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kuroda, Mariko. <emph render="italic">Ramadan Recipes: Ten Ideas For Iftar Meals</emph> </unittitle><unitid>2016-0012</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_cdaf7be0d248f1c0fbc5bff17d67eefb">A 68-page full color book featuring illustrations and photographs, Ramadan Recipes proposes ten iftar recipes to break the fast for each day of Ramadan.

It is an exploration of identity of one's self and as an artist, while seeking to understand the 'betweenness' amidst it all.

He lives both in popular culture and high art. The number of films and television series featuring Vincent van Gogh (1853¬–1890) as a character has long since exceeded one hundred. This thesis questions the difference of seeing reproductions of his paintings on screen rather than the originals in museums or reproductions in books or online. The narrative and accessibility of film medium allows a wider audience to see his paintings in places where his paintings have not been previously exhibited. While translating painted images to the filmic medium cannot reproduce the experience of seeing the originals, van Gogh continues to entice filmmakers from different generations to render different stories about van Gogh and his art on screen. By examining the first major Hollywood film on the artist, Lust for Life (1956), and later Vincent and Theo (1990), and the first fully painted animated film Loving Vincent (2017), I argue how over time technological differences allowed filmmakers to shed new light on the van Gogh myth and his artwork by using film as a means for reaching different audiences.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f8592d172a1231708b9cb16a265e7d20" level="file"><did><unittitle>You, Lauren. <emph render="italic">Shik-gu: The People Who Eat Together</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0032</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_1593bc1ca10676c5846d493b9e8ddb8f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_00b336accd3e9d0550a5ae78917f677f" parent="aspace_1593bc1ca10676c5846d493b9e8ddb8f" type="folder">2019-0032</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8e13b7e64c4d11c16268d6075297ede2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shik-gu: The People Who Eat Together is a socially engaged art project and a platform for people of NYU Abu Dhabi to connect and provide company for one another through sharing a meal online.

This artwork responds to our community's concerns and offers a platform for conversations, at once intimate and public, that otherwise might remain unexpressed.It explores the vulnerability of putting ourselves online in a meaningful way, of mitigating the loneliness that is amplified by eating on one's own. It connects us to others also participating in the livestream and brings us together as a temporary "family."</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_836a1f41f91a8c57a9d247a1da336d2b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Nuaimi, Hessa. <emph render="italic">The Cultural Foundation in Abu Dhabi, 1981-2008</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0008</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_91e4355aa92adabd73fec22efd65ca2b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_c63d958cb53d99a0a94d6b95dfe0222e" parent="aspace_91e4355aa92adabd73fec22efd65ca2b" type="folder">2020-0008</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8863334307912c703043d6fe90e55f5d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>If you were to ask any person who grew up in Abu Dhabi in the 1980s or 1990s, how they spent their free time, they most probably will mention their trips to the Cultural Foundation (CF). While there were other cultural centers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), none compared to the CF. Located in the heart of the city, it attracted people from all over Abu Dhabi and other Emirates because of its reputation as a nexus for writers and artists. The CF played a significant role in the development of Abu Dhabi's art and culture ecosystem. Most importantly, it had sustained engagement with its surrounding community and activated a space for all to be a part of. To this day, many have described the CF as their second home where they attended lectures, workshops, poetry nights, and movie screenings.This paper examines the CF's first active period 1981-2008 and its relationship with the Abu Dhabi's community. The three main questions addressed in this paper are: Why was the CF so popular amongst the community? How was that achieved and what can be learned from that experience?	</p><p>Cultural Foundation, Cultural Institutions, Abu Dhabi, Art and Culture</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_52627b7b2a10ae963f4b06d414c63c41" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ali Al Fardan, Fatema. <emph render="italic">On ​between the three of us: A Visual Arts Virtual Capstone Exhibition</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0011</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_4ef784ab5be842c88c326fd8413ba10e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_1c44ece8ac3b15dfb0dd21265ab0ca2b" parent="aspace_4ef784ab5be842c88c326fd8413ba10e" type="folder">2020-0011</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fa526b5f6933896ad1268890d166c82c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Between the three of us chronicles my narrative within my family, culture, and stereotypes.</p><p>https://artspaces.kunstmatrix.com/en/exhibition/640751/between-the-three-of-us</p><p>identity, family, culture, stereotypes</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_78bff5f41f595c897dcd683dca238824" level="file"><did><unittitle>Banerjee, Devaki. <emph render="italic">Go Back to Sleep</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0006</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_e646d951538759dffb08563b7a4fc323" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_68431709b74b6efe13e62ae873f2e38b" parent="aspace_e646d951538759dffb08563b7a4fc323" type="folder">2020-0006</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_acf1d27265af72ceeec5c316f05f221e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Go Back to Sleep is a bedtime story, for an overwhelmed young adult.

My capstone project analyzes the changing perception and reception of modern and contemporary art from the WANA region over the last thirty years, with a focus on the collecting and display of these works in the British Museum. My research investigates the British Museum's collection strategies and exhibition patterns for modern and contemporary art from the WANA regions, with a special emphasis on works created in Egypt.

The performance also invokes prolonged exposure as well as social engagement, as subscribers document their emotional experience throughout the month by contributing screenshots of impactful moments of the conversation, alongside a short written commentary.

Identity is fleeting and nothing throughout our lives stays the same. That might be the only consistent thing in it. How We Leave is a short narrative film that shows a day in two girls' lives, in which they have to learn how to grow up. The story examines the way children deal with trauma and perceive adults, what it does to their friendship. Fear follows them no matter how far away from everyone they go, because the biggest monsters truly are hidden within ourselves. Growing up doesn't mean that fear goes away, it means that the person learns how to keep moving forward while being afraid. And it looks like it is much easier to do so if there is a friend on your side.</p><p>Short-Film, Children, Aging Desert</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_87b4ea071861ab71c0b0206a9df12a03" level="file"><did><unittitle>Peterson, Hunter. <emph render="italic">|</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0014</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_90e11efbedeb7f061cae950b84ef9c94" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_19dd713edd06336d776681cc8da423f3" parent="aspace_90e11efbedeb7f061cae950b84ef9c94" type="folder">2020-0014</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9473d68d234020fe22049fba3b44e502"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>My piece titled "|" is an artistic endeavor exploring the concept of existence through a memoiristic abstraction of reality and realities.

From 1947, the tone of those relationships changed substantially, from authoritarian to more collaborative. Recent scholarship suggests that this change was due to a diversification of the educational backgrounds of the British representatives: prior to 1947, all of them had attended public schools, which imbued them with highly imperialistic attitudes. However, after 1947, their education was more diverse, and no longer propagated such an imperial ideology; thus, the British representatives were no longer as authoritarian.<lb/><lb/>This thesis offers a more nuanced version of this argument, by taking into account the prevailing attitudes towards Empire in Britain, as well as pressures on Britain's position in the Gulf from powers in the region. Ultimately, I argue, educational background merely contributed to the change in the relationship; more significant were regional pressures that forced the British representatives to effect policy that necessitated greater collaboration with the local rulers, and thus a change in the nature of the relationship.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">Arabian/Persian Gulf</geogname><subject source="lcsh">British Empire</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Great Britain</geogname><subject source="lcsh">History</subject><geogname source="lcsh">United Arab Emirates</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref15_4st" level="file"><did><unittitle>Manela, Caroline Victoria. <emph render="italic">Violence and Exchange: Middlemen of the Sixteenth- and Seventeenth Century Mediterranean</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0012</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_9465c34c24e08dc2919bae27f83e2862" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_bc7e8d5de8c5f657052e259d4867e95f" parent="aspace_9465c34c24e08dc2919bae27f83e2862" type="folder">2014-0012</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8d497d8e5d2edcf07711d784e0f5e582"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: History<lb/>Abstract: Historians of the pre-modern Mediterranean have challenged the argument that the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Mediterranean ceased to exist as a frontier of fruitful cross-religious contact between Christian Europeans and Muslim North Africans. This thesis supports that position by showing that amidst violence, specific types of middlemen, including corsairs, captives, slaves, and diplomats, continued to live in connection with both Christian Europe and Muslim North Africa. I argue for an understanding of religious violence that accepts its tragic and harmful consequences while acknowledging it as an avenue through which cross-cultural and religious knowledge was facilitated. Within this framework, I explore the physical violence of piracy and captivity as well as the concept of structural violence in connection with the career of the Jewish merchant and diplomat Samuel Pallache. Finally, I turn to consider an anti-Christian polemical work that has received limited scholarly attention: Ahmad ibn Qasim al-Hajari's Kitab nasir al din 'ala 'l-qawm al-kafirin (The Supporter of Religion Against the Infidel). The violent language in Kitab nasir al-din was the only way in which al-Hajari could convey stories of his respect and admiration for Christians to his Muslim North African audience.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Violence</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Mediterranean Sea</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Religion</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref16_n4y" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tattersall, Jessica Joan. <emph render="italic">The Doctor as Biographer: The Politics of Intimacy in Historical Biographies of Winston Churchill and Mao Zedong</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0019</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_1e81425900947780542a81753aeb2684" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_b382666039962af9e0afd68572b35c5a" parent="aspace_1e81425900947780542a81753aeb2684" type="folder">2014-0019</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f7d95ce5bfd41f489b912ca379123b09"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: History<lb/>Major: This thesis compares the politics of intimacy in two biographies written by doctors: Churchill: The Struggle for Survival 1940-1965 (1966) by Charles Wilson (known by his honourary title of Lord Moran), and The Private Life of Chairman Mao (1994) by Li Zhisui. Both Moran and Li spent over twenty years serving as the personal physicians of Winston Churchill and Mao Zedong respectively, forming extremely close relationships in the process.<lb/>All biography written by personal associates raises the question of how such relationships affect not only the content of the work, but also its reception. However, research regarding this question is surprisingly thin, and in turn the question remains largely unanswered. This thesis, by comparing biographical traditions in both England and China, and by examining biographies of Winston Churchill and Mao Zedong, offers specific answers to this question. I argue that a comparative analysis, mindful of the distinctive features of Chinese and English biographical traditions, reveals that the politics of intimacy in historical biography is greatly shaped not only by historical context, but also by present day values.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><genreform source="lcsh">Biographies</genreform><geogname source="lcsh">China</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">England, UK</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Historiography</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref331_9nd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Evans, Laura May. <emph render="italic">Internalising Identities: Internment Camps in Australia in World War II as a Tool of Nation Building</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-004</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_77560e6e2afe92645685b032336c7d39" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_f25569d9d4b59678d343a5c62b255aeb" parent="aspace_77560e6e2afe92645685b032336c7d39" type="folder">2015-0014</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9b98424e3c112ca937f98f2080d2b980"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: History<lb/>Abstract: The internment of foreign nationals in Australia during World War II is one example of exclusionary practices used in Australian history to define in and out groups in Australian society. This example often disappears from dominant narratives of Australian military and social history, or internees' experiences are written about in isolated categories of nationalities. This study examines internees' own stories from the Tatura and Loveday internment camps in conjunction with official histories and different trends in writing Australian history. In addition, this study looks at ways internees were forced to confront their own identities through internment and how on exit from the camps, internees were pressured to adopt attitudes in line with Anglo-Australia and internalised their internment experience. Finally, this study shows that recent trends in Australian history have focused on finding space for non-white others and that internment camps need to be incorporated in these histories to understand the forces that have constructed white Australian identities and subsequent politics.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">International migration</subject><subject source="local">Migration</subject><subject source="lcsh">Historiography</subject><subject source="lcsh">Race</subject><subject source="lcsh">World War II</subject><subject source="lcsh">Internment camps</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Australia</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Identity</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref420_zgm" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dinan, Cian. <emph render="italic">Dying Among the Geraniums: Madness in the Congo Free State.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0003</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_69dc0bdc42120d464cf1709c9a0147cd">At the turn of the 20th century, violent conditions in the Congo Free State colony of Belgian King Leopold II sparked international outcry. Reformist literature surrounding the London-based Congo Reform Association (CRA) criticized the King and his colony by inverting imperial discourse, identifying Leopold's State with excess, savagery, and madness. Through this mode of critique, CRA writers perpetuated an imperialist ideology based on a masculine ideal of the colonizer.

Reformist literature surrounding the London-based Congo Reform Association (CRA) criticized the King and his colony by inverting imperial discourse, identifying Leopold's State with excess, savagery, and madness. Through this mode of critique, CRA writers perpetuated an imperialist ideology based on a masculine ideal of the colonizer. In reworking these accusations of madness, modern literary and historical adaptations of the history of the State and the CRA repeat an ultimately unproductive discourse of violence, rooted in ideals of imperial masculinity. This paper examines the gendered nature of this discourse, and attempts to move away from hegemonic representations of violence through historical-literary analysis of three distinct moments.

This capstone examines the relationship between tea trade and state building in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands as China struggled to create a modern nation from the ruins of an empire.

Informed by key ideas from Situationist International and Sherry Turkle, my Capstone seeks to react to these theorists' concepts by considering them in relation to our current situation with social media. Overall, composed of two experiences: a social media daring game and an interactive installation, my Capstone invites people to reconsider their relationship with social media and their use of it as well. As subjects to the attention economy that drives and monetizes social media, it is imperative for social media users to be aware of its implications and to have some critical understanding of the dynamics at play. In light of this, the two components of my Capstone project strive to facilitate this understanding.</p><p>https://simulacra.myportfolio.com/</p><p>social media, art, game, simulacra, spectacle</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_cc15955f4f9030b394e6d925c1c93b45" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lootah, Mai. <emph render="italic">mirari</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0019</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_98e6d448c8bbede65cfd711c5f663116" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0289a4860c56b621bbd63480c4b672c8" parent="aspace_98e6d448c8bbede65cfd711c5f663116" type="folder">2020-0019</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d317b4039a7bef61f79aebaadf1913c2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>During the period of Fall 2019 to Spring 2020, I began my process of brainstorming, prototyping, playtesting and finalizing my Capstone Project, mirari. The essay outlines my entire process till completion, and discusses how I came to decide on the design aspects, to the struggles I faced along the way. I began with the themes of reality, perception, light, landscape and infinity. Throughout the building process, I went through several experimentation stages and prototypes, welcoming new methods and ideas which all connected to the elements I had chosen. Integrating the historical and theoretical themes that helped me polish and contextualise my project. With a recent study I did on James Turrell's artwork, whom I acknowledge is a large inspiration to my project, I found that the backbone of my project falls in parallel with his theories.

Because a large portion of these laws come from the EU or international conventions that have been brought into local legislation, primarily the Human Rights Act of 1998, I want to study the implications Brexit may have on an uncodified and EU derived conception of Human Rights. Aside from theoretically analyzing this through the law and bills and acts, I aim to survey UK residents or citizens- i.e. those who the laws and possible change in the provision of human rights in the UK impact. In my survey, I will try to understand whether the subjects know about how their rights are provided in the UK, whether they feel a gap due to the uncodified nature of the constitution and whether they know the impact Brexit may have.	</p><p>Human rights, UK, Constitution, Unwritten Constitution</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8e7c9c49a350260dce34ac2f50f3e9c3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pearce, James. <emph render="italic">The Ethical Ramifications of Artificial Intelligence in the Legal Profession</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0021</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_b62702d62f004878ac2d0dd664d24ff8" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_33c6dc73f99d29371781b0d39a47b994" parent="aspace_b62702d62f004878ac2d0dd664d24ff8" type="folder">2020-0022</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_353de9e96c28f733eeb8715ee967a104"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Artificial intelligence is disrupting most traditional industries, and the legal sphere is no exception. Artificial intelligence offers the potential to greatly increase access to the law, particularly for low-income clients, but raises many serious ethical questions. These questions include, first, the extent to which artificial intelligence can offer competent legal representation, and second, whether additional regulation is required to protect individuals from incompetent representation or breaches of confidentiality. Artificial Intelligence will alter the relationship between lawyer and client, and require from lawyers a keen understanding of developments in this nascent field. These ethical concerns give rise to issues of regulation and legal education. This paper analyses the current state of Artificial Intelligence in general, as well as its current and potential future impact on the legal profession.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_9a7869404b77d1034733ab28d89aebc8" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Literature and Creative Writing</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref18_hh2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Germaine, Carmen Caroline. <emph render="italic">Anxious Omnivores: Animal Ambivalence and Meat Ambiguity in Animals, Life of Pi, and The Year of the Flood</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0011</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_a08f82fbc7c0e434cbd9e3d26f51bc6c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_37a788ebd4944d6f337c36730d5d21ba" parent="aspace_a08f82fbc7c0e434cbd9e3d26f51bc6c" type="folder">2014-0011</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d3bc082e88b51533af0cf39a4d1dfc67"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Literature<lb/>Abstract: This thesis examines the cultural politics and ethics of meat and meat-eating in three contemporary Canadian novels: Don LePan's Animals, 2009; Yann Martel's Life of Pi, 2001; and Margaret Atwood's The Year of the Flood, 2009. I argue that each novel contains a specific anxiety over whether—and under what conditions—eating meat is ethically justifiable, and that in each case this anxiety stems from questions about how humans draw distinctions between their own species and nonhuman animals. Each novel also demonstrates an awareness that these boundaries, both between humans and nonhumans and between different species of animals, are often arbitrary and subject to change. Fundamental human ambivalences in how to relate to different species of animals lead to the physical ambiguity of meat; acknowledging these ambivalences results in a "cannibal anxiety", or anxiety over whether eating nonhuman flesh is any different than eating human flesh. I will examine how these novels reveal or suggest ways of dealing with these ambiguities and their resultant anxieties, and how they challenge the reader to rethink both their meat-eating practices and their wider relationships to nonhuman animals in general.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">Canada</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Meat</subject><subject source="lcsh">Ambiguity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Anxiety</subject><subject source="lcsh">Animals</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref19_xga" level="file"><did><unittitle>James, Katherine Delia. <emph render="italic">World Literature in Spanish: Realismo Mágico from Vela to García Màrquez</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0022</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_f1caa6b141cfc7f405565fae3e6a7e52" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_68f287f98ab61622864c8bac87aae33e" parent="aspace_f1caa6b141cfc7f405565fae3e6a7e52" type="folder">2014-0022</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2ce7ccb3fd71e9c659a30ebf2b03dd60"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Literature<lb/>Abstract: This thesis explores the forgotten history of both world literature in Spanish and the circulation of magic realism through Madrid to Latin America.

In creating realist narratives of resistance to colonialism and neocolonialism, these writers have implicitly cooperated with western literary critics who insist on reading literary works by African-born writers as anthropological accounts of life in "Africa." Nigerian-born author Buchi Emecheta's critical reputation was built around her early realist fiction, which critics continue to read as anthropological accounts of a universally African female experience. This paper reads Emecheta outside this critical paradigm by focusing on her only work of speculative fiction, The Rape of Shavi. Ultimately, reading Emecheta's work in relation to The Rape of Shavi suggests new modes of reading the canon of African women's fiction.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Anthropology</subject><subject source="lcsh">Realism</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Nigeria</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">West Africa</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Feminism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref347_a6l" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kelani, Naila Hafiz. <emph render="italic">On leaving a little smarter: Navigating space and a "minor" identity in transvergent post-beur cinema.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0016</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_79d3f1d9ddc85c314e9f716edbb9f401" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_f76a23bca2b219dc0743ef78788dda15" parent="aspace_79d3f1d9ddc85c314e9f716edbb9f401" type="folder">2015-0016</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b494a26303ab8d40ab13f75956fbafe9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Literature and Creative Writing<lb/>Abstract: Cinéma beur has traditionally been treated as a sociological cinema documenting the 'real' French-Maghrebi experience. The young protagonists of Jacques Audiard's Un Prophète (2009) and Mohamed Hamidi's Né Quelque Part (2013) navigate between Frenchness, Arabness, and Muslimness in ways that render their complex identities institutionally irreconcilable. Throughout the films' narratives, they encounter changing conceptions of their overlapping identities in the context of their movements through spaces via temporal and metaphorical journeys within (and without) the French Republic.<lb/>Borrowing Will Higbee's notion of 'post-beur' cinema, I argue that these films resist being read through the realist, sociological, and postcolonial lenses that differentiate, if not the films themselves, then the analyses that they invite, from the "beur" generation. They mark a departure towards a transvergent cinema that deconstructs notions of center and margins, incorporating Deleuze's rhizome towards a reading of how the features and inconsistencies of a racialized French society serve as catalysts towards these characters "becoming" minoritarian.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">Algeria</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">France</geogname><subject source="local">Beur cinema</subject><geogname source="lcsh">North Africa</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref329_kb9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Leith, Sachi. <emph render="italic">Unsettling Nomadism: Becoming-Minor in Galsan Tschinag's Die Rückkehr</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0019</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_adbad10ecf73fd2de44511aeeca1a175" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_1f972b8f8c5a04330e862c0a1636f036" parent="aspace_adbad10ecf73fd2de44511aeeca1a175" type="folder">2015-0019</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_916c646d0aa866161e18083e639c1d69"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Literature, History<lb/>Abstract: The study of non-ethnic German authors, of increasing importance to German literature, has traditionally focused only on those within Germany. The enigmatic work of Galsan Tschinag, however, a Tuvan Mongolian shaman and author of thirty books in German, provokes a radical re-imagination of the contours of German literary and linguistic history. His fictionalized autobiography Die Rückkehr: Roman meines Lebens [The Return: Novel of my Life], the most aesthetically self-conscious of his texts, invokes Mongol, Soviet, Tuvan, and European literary forms to weave together Central Asian and European histories. I read Die Rückkehr in conversation with Deleuze and Guattari's Toward a Minor Literature, whose emphasis on language as a deterritorialized, dynamic space of imagination, rather than an entity circumscribed by national boundaries, allows me to analyze Tschinag's work within the broader contexts of German and Mongolian literatures, and of minor literatures in general. The text's formal experimentation and staging of autobiographical truth through fiction allow the author to comment on both post-socialist Mongolia and contemporary Germany. By revealing the various traditions that converge in his work, I argue for a more integrated understanding of Eurasian history via German as a global language.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">German language</subject><subject source="local">German Writing</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Germany</geogname><subject source="local">Postsocialism</subject><subject source="local">Deterritorialization</subject><subject source="lcsh">Postcolonialism</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Mongolia</geogname><occupation source="lcsh">Shamans</occupation><subject source="lcsh">Nomads</subject><subject source="local">Minor literature</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref335_d0a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sutherland, Jamie Alexander. <emph render="italic">'The Time-Devouring Nightingale': Toward A Borgesian Conception of World Literature </emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0008</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_f4068dcb0d79e4ea3d7071c4437c5ce5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_09051d6b1beb09274636bf5d2119bbb8" parent="aspace_f4068dcb0d79e4ea3d7071c4437c5ce5" type="folder">2015-0008</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_48cf101f146de9930a41d1e2eec8af47"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Literature<lb/>Abstract: Many of Jorge Luis Borges's works reject linear understandings of time, allowing him to rewrite history and tradition. Borges uses translation to reshape his literary heritage, as well as his own national history. This practice is exemplified by his 1925 translation of the last page of James Joyce's Ulysses in the publication Proa, which recreates Ulysses in Buenos Aires and, when published, challenged conceptions of what Argentine literature should look like. His Antología de la literatura fantástica ('Anthology of Fantastic Literature'), which includes other translated portions of Ulysses, upsets traditional understandings of the canon, periods of literary history, and traditional practices of translation. My project explores Borges's unconventional understanding of chronology to consider how his literary texts unsettle orthodox understandings of world literature, as well as of Argentine history and literary tradition. An alternative conception of world literature based on a non-linear sense of time elucidates Borges's own works, as well as Joyce's Ulysses, and suggests how current dominant models of world literature could be reimagined.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><title source="lcsh">|a Joyce, James, |d 1882-1941. |t Ulysses</title><subject source="lcsh">Spanish language</subject><subject source="lcsh">World literature</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Argentina</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref429_2tx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hu, Zoë. <emph render="italic">Disorderly Time in Jhumpa Lahiri and Amitac Ghosh: Narrative Studies as a Strategy for Reading Migration Novels.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0018</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f3de6ff94ea0720f41e7ba2c037d4012">This project relies on the field of narrative studies to demonstrate how migration novels by Lahiri and Ghosh espouse conceptions of migration temporalities that stray from the irreversible, often times oppressive, model of linear time.

Thinking with both highlights the need to re-evaluate how intertextuality fits within these new literary contexts. Season of Migration to the North seems to be anticipating space for a kind of postcolonial intertextuality, which owes a debt to theories of intertextuality while highlighting how such a technique becomes a strategic tool for a novel to insert itself into a universal library.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6f0f98132b68ece9e01698a671ff9948" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jayatilake, Thirangie. <emph render="italic">The Difficulties of Resistance: The Female Body as object in The Lament of the Dhobi Woman, The End of Innocence, and Fasting, Feasting.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0030</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c25702904a25bf75a7cb1ec13a00f8af">The paper explores the difficulty of resisting the patriarchy in three South Asian novels, The Lament of Dhobi Woman, The End of Innocence and Fasting, Feasting.

It was only when Hong Kong identity faced the "double trauma of the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 followed by the Tiananmen Massacre of 1989" did people realize that "the Hong Kong way of life with its mixture of colonialist and democratic trappings was in imminent danger of disappearing" (Abbas 6-7). The 1997 Handover, which, marked the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, then, became a deadline against which the city's writers utilized different strategies to preserve Hong Kong's postcolonial identity, to resist the imminent threat of identity decolonization and potentially, recolonization. This thesis specifically will investigate the specific strategies used by Leung Ping Kwan and Louise Ho in their poetry to preserve Hong Kong's postcolonial identity, looking towards yet another deadline in 2047- when the "One Country, Two Systems" arrangement that currently governs Hong Kong is set to expire.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f82a5402e9b24a6ac378f2e64b862891" level="file"><did><unittitle>Zhang, Eva. <emph render="italic">Grotesque Melancholies</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0017</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_35cea133494d56b3dada18a8258e39fc" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_39202537b61cef330f34afc45c1b3da1" parent="aspace_35cea133494d56b3dada18a8258e39fc" type="folder">2019-0017</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c62ee49cb68c76b29670cf94aecd4aa4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>'Grotesque Melancholies' is a long poem that sets out to explore the balance between Eva's own creative voice and her passion for the work of T.S.

When they take on a more active role in the narrative, it is to be in the service of others. This capstone project sought to understand the nature of sports manga's "soft power" in contemporary culture through exploring the connection between the conservatism of sports manga's gender politics and its popularity. This conservatism is the lingering legacy of Japan's encounters with Western attitudes and ideals, especially in terms of athleticism and womanhood, which have been adapted into Japanese cultural norms. Examples included deference to hierarchy and images of masculine strength. The prevalence of such norms, as evidenced by its representation on the pages of modern sports manga like Furudate Haruichi's Haikyū!!, this project's case study text, hinders modern manga from realizing its full potential to be progressive.	</p><p>"sports manga," Japan, manga, Haikyū!!</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5234b4d6f067105ee927735b7ebfc5ac" level="file"><did><unittitle>Golovakova, Ria. <emph render="italic">The Trouble with Utopias and Humans: Posthumanism in Politics and Folklore in Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's Monday Starts on Saturday and Tale of the Troika</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0031</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_42463fde44ebb60bcbfe54e5e83284e0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_e18b7444095e8224a079c80ab668bf00" parent="aspace_42463fde44ebb60bcbfe54e5e83284e0" type="folder">2020-0031</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_93da5fcaebe72b76cb584218400116dc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>"Like all science," says Roman Oira-Oira. "Our work deals with human happiness." Oira-Oira, one of the most respected employees of the National Institute for the Technology of Witchcraft and Thaumaturgy (NITWiT), announces this claim in the first chapter of Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's utopian novel Monday Starts on Saturday (1965). Within the text, his statement is not hyperbolic: the fictional Institute is centered around improving the human condition and contains a Department of Linear Human Happiness, a Department of the Meaning of Life, and a Department of Eternal Youth. This project examines different ideas of utopia – political, scientific, and literary – within a cycle of hope and disillusionment as the narration shifts from the realistic to the fantastical in both Monday Starts on Saturday and its sequel Tale of the Troika (1968). I look at how different conceptions of human nature intertwine and conflict with utopian visions within the Soviet communist ideology, expressed through representations of folkloric characters and magic systems. By zooming in on the mechanics behind the fantastical, this project crafts an analytical approach to deconstructing utopia and understanding human nature.	</p><p>Strugatsky, Soviet literature, science fiction, utopia, posthumanism, folklore</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b1329690811d5a2da4f2d9618f4239ce" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gutierrez Carrera, Julian. <emph render="italic">The Liminality of Visual Novels</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0027</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_0cd12208a4719472526d6e52b1e03cb7" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_fd3bf0dc8e92952f24debcb29a28c454" parent="aspace_0cd12208a4719472526d6e52b1e03cb7" type="folder">2020-0027</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0fd939c28656ee53b42a51d23b6537a5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Visual novels are a form of video game that occupy an odd space within the label of "video games," but there is something odd about them: although they are considered video games, most of the gaming experience consists of reading and experiencing a narrative. Gameplay usually consists of choice-making moments where the narrative flow stops for the player to make a decision, and the choice will alter how the story plays out. Since VNs have this gameplay factor in them, they have never been theorised as part of Literature. But since their gameplay is limited and most of their focus is on story, they are not theorised as part of Game Studies either. Through three analyses, I find a way to read visual novels using elements from both literary analysis and game analysis but enabling for a better reading of visual novels as forms of art.</p><p>wp.nyu.edu/visualnovels</p><p>visual novels, video games, adventure, videogame,s literature, game studies</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_392db6e5e83deed7987f49f6e2289c8b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Joaquin, Nikki. <emph render="italic">Hawak</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0030</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_edc449f2f4ca3aa05335f5f4884e7301" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_de082fa1baa08048fee8697808b3e2a0" parent="aspace_edc449f2f4ca3aa05335f5f4884e7301" type="folder">2020-0030</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e4e9bb748566fbd99616c3641ea2f8c0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>"Hawak" is a novella about an aswang, a local monster from Filipino urban legend that feeds on unborn children, that awakens in modern-day Baguio city.

The problem animating my paper is the rape of Moji Kasali, a Nigerian acquaintance of the novel's narrator, Julius. Moji accuses Julius of having raped her when he was fourteen and she fifteen. My capstone is shaped by Moji's accusation. In my paper, I consider Moji's rape to be the founding rupture of the novel: Open City arises, in other words, in response to this disastrous event in Moji's and Julius's lives. Troubled by the rape — which he has forgotten — and by its reminder through Moji's accusation, Julius, I suggest, writes Open City as an attempt to recreate the innocent, pre-lapsarian wholeness that was lost when he raped Moji. Along the way his attempt at totality is disturbed by race, gender, history, all three embodied foremost by Moji.	</p><p>race, gender, totality, aesthetic theory, sublime, history</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_48bb8a78bb7423a6d489b47dabdd3556" level="file"><did><unittitle>Satterfield, Scout. <emph render="italic">The End of the World and Other Experiments</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0032</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_d4ef74f1a9616c70f83c4faf61a998b5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_6767d7f3755ceaac34432b41d4b65ea2" parent="aspace_d4ef74f1a9616c70f83c4faf61a998b5" type="folder">2020-0032</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4032d5640533833e89850f7ad90be537"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This collection of short stories explores form, style and voice in storytelling.	</p><p>Short story, Creative writing</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_a96bab95b2c4e734d4dcc0c5250287b7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sinha, Vamika. <emph render="italic">Cranes</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0023</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_a10876abb13769429eb7a79b6dcd972b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_d1eb290b49972b17f8ce519320ad577a" parent="aspace_a10876abb13769429eb7a79b6dcd972b" type="folder">2020-0023</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bd77e256912177a9ea5a37689cb6c1d3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Cranes is a collection of poetry and creative non-fiction bridging cosmopolitanism and women of color (WOC).

Finally, I propose the design and construction of an interactive digital synthesizer system to explore and test the ideas discussed in this paper.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9d668a14059d97935e6ef550dac7a1d3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kuzmneko, Leonid. <emph render="italic">Blending Technology, Virtual Instruments, and Live Performers in Music Scoring</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0006</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e7f744d15b25fc00c25c44f5a6963ac2">The paper describes the framework that is introduced by me, which aims at blending virtual instruments, live performers, robotic instruments, and controllers together in a concert environment in a form of an orchestral piece of music that is approximately 40 minutes long.

Intermixtures between contemporary styles and folk music are important because of their ability to revive old genres that are not as present in the lives of today's generations anymore. This paper explores ways to create such fusions between Romanian folk music and the Electronic Dance Music genre "Dubstep" through three versions of the Romanian folk song "Ca pe luncă" created in the Digital Audio Workstation Logic Pro. The first version is simply a recreation of "Ca pe luncă" with digital and recorded instruments. The second version was created with the intention of keeping a larger amount of the Romanian piece intact, preserving its meter and tempo. The last version was made to preserve the meter and tempo of the Dubstep genre, thus keeping more of its main characteristics.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_fd5b7cff91643207f1d3ebeac438e7f3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Vaidya, Himag. <emph render="italic">Analyzing the transformative effects of Music Production on the Expressive Value of a Composition</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0005</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_e6920635996b1b4c50fe9d620d2e4a39" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_d4fd9f8be89df20e641aa4da924db3e4" parent="aspace_e6920635996b1b4c50fe9d620d2e4a39" type="folder">2019-0005</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c981d9fee11e2d161209a9265f4af25e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Through this capstone I aim to examine how music production can act as a medium to de-contextualize and re- contextualize a piece of music and affect its expressive value by influencing its composition, lyrics, arrangement and sonic characteristics.

Beebe's solution employs concepts from cognitive science along with a mechanism of statistical relevance to pick out a unique process type.  I argue that Beebe's view cannot rule out process types defined by periods of time, and because of this, the view falls victim to a trivialization.  Beebe's view yields the result that true beliefs are maximally justified and false beliefs are maximally unjustified.  I explore several strategies to avoid the temporal types trivialization and ultimately find them to be unsatisfactory.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Externalism (Philosophy of mind)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Epistemology</subject><subject source="local">Generality problem</subject><subject source="local">Reliabilism</subject><subject source="lcsh">Statistics</subject><subject source="local">Trivialization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref23_xs5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Shirley, Joshua Cameron. <emph render="italic">Conundrums in Compatibilism: Manipulation and Identity</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0021</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_b451da312301399eea6e291f490bdb8d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_399260389f853df367344c139e105eb7" parent="aspace_b451da312301399eea6e291f490bdb8d" type="folder">2014-0021</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5ac27450f782246062e1f336fda8c5c4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Philosophy, Political Science<lb/>Abstract: In this paper, I endeavour to lay out some of the virtues and flaws of the prominent historical compatibilist account proposed by John Fischer and Mark Ravizza in Responsibility and Control: A Theory of Moral Responsibility.

However, many prominent philosophers have often punted on giving a concrete theory of what 'admissible' means, often leaving it a primitive term and at best associating it with 'appropriate' or 'correct'. I suggest two alternative theories for defining 'admissible', which overcome some of the problems that primitive concepts of it encounter, such as higher-order vagueness and inaccessibility of meaning facts. I finally compare these alternative theories, a polling view and a core traits view of 'admissible', with the primitive conceptions to show that it is worth exploring more concrete theories of admissibility in order to improve supervaluationism.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Admissibility</subject><subject source="local">Supervaluationism</subject><subject source="local">Vagueness</subject><subject source="lcsh">Vagueness (Philosophy)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref432_rr5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Arseculeratne, Anishka. <emph render="italic">Examining Appiah's Identity and Cosmopolitanism</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0001</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_84e8586a1e3164ebabd8179129083bfa">In his book Ethics of Identity, Appiah explores the messy territory of the relation among identity, individuality, and ethics. His exploration begins with his view of the nature of the self and leads to his view about the obligations that individuals have toward others, which he calls Rooted Cosmopolitanism. Appiah's work draws upon liberal and communitarian ideas which have been in tension since the inception of the liberal-communitarian debate in the 1980s. In each case, Appiah deliberately places himself in the middle ground between liberal and communitarian ideas. In this paper I aim to systematise both Appiah's view of the self and his Rooted Cosmopolitanism, and examine the relation between the two views. I will then locate each view on the spectrum of ideas between those of the hardline liberal and the hardline communitarian to determine whether or not his view is coherent and truly original.</abstract><container id="aspace_5ef594322eb3a675f9b309e8aff07dbd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_30192a1fdeee5291116e6a93e69c331e" parent="aspace_5ef594322eb3a675f9b309e8aff07dbd" type="folder">2016-0001</container></did><controlaccess><subject source="local">ethics</subject><subject source="lcsh">Identity</subject><subject source="local">liberalism</subject><subject source="local">communitarianism</subject><subject source="local">cosmopolitanism</subject><subject source="local">rooted cosmopolitanism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref423_sxg" level="file"><did><unittitle>Leb, Benjamin Jared. <emph render="italic">Reasoning About Promises</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0002</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_944a7b2e85ad9edbcefba94fbea96faf">In his recent book, Shaping the Normative Landscape, David Owens presents a view on the value and function of obligation.

Depersonalization, a phenomenon which entails feeling estranged from how we normally experience ourselves, is typically understood as a mental disorder; as harmful, disruptive, and negative. However, a central motivation in Buddhist philosophy is to demonstrate the illusory nature of the self, and to rid ourselves of its grip through certain practices. Consequently, my project analyzes the differences between depersonalization and the Buddhist practices, backing each up with neuroscientific data when possible, to explain how each bears on our experience of ourselves as selves. Additionally, I weigh both accounts against philosophical criteria of what constitutes a mental disorder, drawing conclusions which separate depersonalization and Buddhist practices both in terms of the underlying processes, and the normativity behind each experience.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e81d2cfbd906596093e4f1c006d19133" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chapman, Taj. <emph render="italic">Mind Your Language: A Philosophical Investigation into Objectivity in Journalism</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0170</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_b5be1f9611373c5ca022a289d074688b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_b47d660d205316e099c043f766b0bd74" parent="aspace_b5be1f9611373c5ca022a289d074688b" type="folder">2019-0170</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_de688544082232b3b5f25a3b5b94170e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Despite the notion that objectivity is used to combat bias, this paper argues that appealing to objectivity is far more difficult.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d2481ab29bd3bc96082c74c216f491cd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Du, Xiaoxiao. <emph render="italic">Debunking Evaluative Realism</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0011</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_312fb42b2aaa7606621a85390299c6fd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_cad3280ab101511e9d27cc4e16db93fc" parent="aspace_312fb42b2aaa7606621a85390299c6fd" type="folder">2019-0011</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_aeae0decc738ae5771dd2955aba6fb2a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>I examine several versions of the debunking arguments of evaluative realism.

Considering that the Qur'an provides a minimal amount of information on the specifics of paying and receiv- ing zakat, Muslims had to rely on theological and ethical interpretations. Inevitably authors had disagreed not only on the specifics of the zakat tradition but also on the reasons and frameworks backing the Islamic pillar. Thus, this paper presents three frameworks of zakat in detail: Al-Ghaz- ali's Mysteries of Almsgiving, Al-Qaradawi's Fiqh al-Zakah, and Maliki's Al-Muwatta. To prove the significant disparity between these frameworks, each of them is compared to a different west- ern normative ethical perspective: virtue ethics, consequentialism, and deontology(respectively).   Furthermore, these frameworks are situated into their Islamic historical background, to portray the history of each specific ethical tradition within its context. Conclusively, I present the varying ethical justifications of the different frameworks Muslims need, for the application of the specific methodology of paying zakat. Overall, this paper contends that each of the authors had a significant personal influence on the interpretations.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c6c25d715574e7e752615fcdaf9b13e1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Huang, Alice. <emph render="italic">What We Talk About When We Talk About Structure</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0044</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_388b2074ea7e69f1510968a9bd63de5f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_77b023544c0462daf1029b316f46bb07" parent="aspace_388b2074ea7e69f1510968a9bd63de5f" type="folder">2019-0044</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1b0255a609618e6fc0b0643b3318ae59"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this paper I examine what the notion of "structure" should amount to in the context of the mind-body debate.

This paper aims to present a comprehensive account of the philosophical discussions on the role of causal dependence in counterfactual analysis, argue for the significance of causal considerations in both deterministic and indeterministic worlds and shed light on some problems with incorporating these causal considerations in the semantics. I present counterexamples to Lewis's standard semantics and discuss how these counterexamples suggest a need for invoking causal independence. I reject the premise—that Morgenbesser counterfactuals are true—based on which Schaffer and Edgington claim that Morgenbesser cases pose a problem for the standard semantics in the first place. I argue that when the indeterministic nature of Morgenbesser cases is accounted for, the counterfactuals comes out to be false. However, I contend that considerations of causal dependence are nevertheless significant in counterfactual analysis for both deterministic and indeterministic scenarios. In the end, I argue that the degree to which one event causally depends on another factors into whether the counterfactual in question is evaluated as true or false. Therefore, notions of causal relevance in the current causal independence approach need to be fine-grained.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_50ea1d50b0b2d53daca898f251b107a8" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Theater</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref29_r5g" level="file"><did><unittitle>Carrasco Valdich, Claudia Patricia. <emph render="italic">Directing Dinamene: Creating Impactful &amp; Accessible Theater</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0015</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_0b26a2ee59df210dc471e115848b5d61" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_e83ba2bdb459a5b2fdb01892171c3850" parent="aspace_0b26a2ee59df210dc471e115848b5d61" type="folder">2014-0015</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_56b231bc5314961c947364bb64b4066d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Theater, Biology<lb/>Abstract:Directed the play, "Dinamene, or the Light Indestructible," which follows the mental and emotional destruction of poet Luís de Camões in the aftermath of a shipwreck in which he let his lover die to save his unfinished manuscript.

Abstract: Through the use of stand-up comedy, the central character J.S attempts to manage the somatic effects of a past trauma originating from rape. This play, which meshes recorded poetry interspersed with live stand-up comedy, provides a gateway to the voice and a method of confrontation. It pulls apart the conventions of silence and suppression that surround the narrative of trauma and puts the traumatic body on display. It disallows the trauma the permission to govern the narrative; stand-up comedy becomes J.S's language to tell her own story of the trauma.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Trauma</subject><subject source="lcsh">Rape</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Stand-up comedy</genreform><genreform source="lcsh">Comedy</genreform><subject source="lcsh">Performing Arts</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Poetry</genreform><subject source="lcsh">Sex</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref337_hi5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Vela Giraldo, Valentina. <emph render="italic">Nubia; a performance about my grandmother</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0023</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_b366f893f6cf07dabcbe5d7472f8e27c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_7b5ed4e63ddd0dc1d3e46f7dedaebe7c" parent="aspace_b366f893f6cf07dabcbe5d7472f8e27c" type="folder">2015-0023</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_297fba84f63932d382bbf922f3689088"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Abstract: This project dissects my return to the womb; it is the culmination of my research project in Cali, Colombia. I travelled to my mother's homeland in search of everything that hurt me in being attached to it. I looked for the pain in my mother tongue, in family memories, and in the grave of my grandmother. But instead of pain, I found peace. Nubia; a performance about my grandmother weaves together the original pain that still haunts me with the peace I discovered in my recent return to Colombia. This yoking together informs the environment, performance, and dramaturgical structure of the piece. In this way, my grandmother becomes the house, her death is manifested as a field of coffee beans, a memory of blood exists as earth, my birth lives in a sowing machine, time is a game of Parcheesi, and my mother's imagined death is my performance.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref430_1x9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al-Mahruqi, Noor. <emph render="italic">Bil3arabi</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0014</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5609d6fe14297bcd273842440d5e8945">سجّل أنا عربي.

It does so through a series of one-on-one portrait-drawing sessions with approximately 80 students from the NYUAD community, during which participants are invited to take on the role of observer and observed. These sessions produce physical artifacts in the form of drawings which will be taken in conjunction with written reflections on the conversations had during the interaction to produce a study of the components that generate meaning within social interactions. The documentation of these sessions will be accompanied by a book of compiled research and images on the topics of social interaction, intimacy, and their artistic resonances. The book and sessions will form the basis of a gallery exhibition presenting the work and its findings.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_59ab6ee40b933f6c39a33b7224a630c8" level="file"><did><unittitle>David, Ethan. <emph render="italic">On Our Borders</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0026</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_9addfe3a800f83ba339a55c20d62f0a3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_32af10878e798a96360c8f654ccd1f09" parent="aspace_9addfe3a800f83ba339a55c20d62f0a3" type="folder">2019-0026</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5eeb34d1ebbfdd8ca04eee7c9d641799"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Composed from interviews with students in New York and Abu Dhabi, On Our Borders is a verbatim performance with original music about Third Culture Kids and the questions their between-cultures experiences pose.

Founded in 2017, Beirut Pride has been heralded as the first "Pride" in the Arab World. However, this raises the question what does "Pride" mean for Beirut and how does Beirut perform a "Pride"? In this paper, I argue that Beirut Pride has a dual effect of creating advocacy and safe spaces for Beiruti citizens while also reshaping Western narratives of the Middle East and Pride as a whole. By looking at Pride as a performance of queer visibility and community building both locally and in a larger global discourse, Beirut Pride calls into question the ways in which visibility is manifested while creating a physical space for the local community.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8260f77a27c2ac65a3dd4ecd5215a86a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Niko, Marika. <emph render="italic">memory is a partial victory over death</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0022</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_480696e34463e2c43e01145bf3243406" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_002b222d3c352ccb32f160d43f7021e6" parent="aspace_480696e34463e2c43e01145bf3243406" type="folder">2019-0022</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fc2e2cb34f287a72720b216cdf5a1a07"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>memory is a partial victory over death is a site-specific dance performance in the A5 Atrium that occurs over the course of sunset.

The piece was inspired by how my grandmother, who has frequent memory loss, talks about her childhood memories. While I have an urge to materialize memories as a response to my fear of forgetting, the conversation with her allowed me to consider how memories can be remembered and worked on through immateriality.

The static view of architecture as the permanent presence of structures is complicated by the utilization of space for theatrical purposes. Events that take place within theatrical spaces allow the structure, the architecture, to become a laboratory for modelling society and experimenting with creative forms of reality, especially so when these spaces double as contact zones for multicultural communities, who are themselves products of movements through space as is the case with the Cartoucherie.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_81a038f86794dee829539e23afe078a8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Szantho, Orsolya. <emph render="italic">nature(.c)ode</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0024</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_83aa559b41e2dfea719c554646faf378" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ce2d1730195cbc6562b45af7cbc105b3" parent="aspace_83aa559b41e2dfea719c554646faf378" type="folder">2019-0024</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9dc79898a9bced786c06d54f139806f0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The interactive installation "nature(.c)ode" is a piece that invites the audience on a sensory journey to explore the possibility of organic coexistence between nature and technology. Structured around two large wooden structures, the installation offers the audience an opportunity to test how their responses to technology change when usual, synthetic surfaces of interaction are replaced by natural textures and organic materials. Designed as a ten-minute experience, the installation guides the audience in the space through its light design. As the lights continually shift, moving from the front to the back, shining on different sides of the two central structures at different times, the audience is invited to move through the space in a similar manner. The two cuboid-shaped central pieces, which serve as the interfaces of interaction, reflect a similar linear progression. By touching different wooden and plant attachments on these structures, the audience plays different tones, creating music together. While the front side of the first structure is covered in more technological tones, these gradually soften towards the back, where they are even accompanied by a light-interaction when the interaction occurs through plants.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d1dbe092a9be9a701b57b52e30aa0e6b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wilkes, Simon. <emph render="italic">Spectra</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0034</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_fe92efd9eb2991360cdd6efca2e40e6f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_9fc694a09a8af3149899c4b16dac2222" parent="aspace_fe92efd9eb2991360cdd6efca2e40e6f" type="folder">2019</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5df770cd34b93c289eb22fee5b8bdf45"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Spectra' is a comic book- play adapted from Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Amazing Fantasy #15, the origin story of Marvel Comics' character, The Amazing Spider- Man.    Conceived as a 'comicbook- play,' 'Spectra' was developed through a series of rehearsal laboratories and writing workshops. Spectra explores playwrighting as a collaborative process and engages the visual form of comic books as a mode of playwrighting. In doing so, 'Spectra' experiments with ways of developing script, where text functions as an icon for language and image, as in the form of comic books.   'Spectra' explores the effects of internal and external violence upon the fractured psyche of a superhero seeking to reconcile the trauma of the past with their desire to wield power in the name of a greater good. By engaging with studies on feminism, tricksterism, transformative justice and queer theory, 'Spectra' seeks to question patriarchal notions of masculinity in order to redefine what it means to be a superhero.   'Spectra' seeks to reframe the vision of the superhero as the sole author of violence in the name of an absolute moral authority and proposea model for the superhero as existing within and accountable to a community of care.</p></scopecontent></c></c></c><c id="aspace_b5939723c04fff5abff3b8b121908017" level="series"><did><unittitle>Engineering Division Projects</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2019" type="inclusive">2014-2019</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_e38fa5d0ae4920f2e2f9b1292852ff68" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Civil Engineering</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref42_my2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Costales, David Ponce and Juma, Joseph Bwerwa. <emph render="italic">Design of Economical Rapid Deployable Structures</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0032</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_c005e55fd09bd67af68a9da2db4df8f8" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ed5552286b43bec6e69193e8ffed4877" parent="aspace_c005e55fd09bd67af68a9da2db4df8f8" type="folder">2014-0032</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2137baa520522e34d891b85fd839aff1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Civil Engineering<lb/>Abstract: Joseph Juma. The forceful displacement of people due to warfare, natural disasters or even persecution presents a pressing need for immediate housing solutions. Presently available rapid deployable structures are part of the solution to this problem. Even so, due to the limited resources that refugees have at hand, these structures are either too expensive or do not meet the pressing needs of the issue. For this reason the scope of this project is the design of an economical rapid deployable structure in an attempt to provide a fast response to refugee situations.<lb/><lb/>The present report documents the design process towards the final proposed structure. For the scope of this report an economical rapid deployable structure is a sub-division of structural systems characterized by the ability to be assembled, dissembled and transported to a different site without losing its functional and structural characteristics. Additionally the design must remaining cost efficient.<lb/><lb/>The present document explores different techniques of design, as well as a variety of materials.

Refugee situations call for immediate housing needs. With the numbers of refugees rising worldwide aid organizations have limited resources to assist efficiently and uniformly. Given that the problems behind the displacement of people are difficult to tackle, economical rapid deployable structures are a necessity. For this reason this project goes through the design process of such structure from conception to the manufacturing of a live scale prototype. The final design was evaluated against several criteria including structural stability, cost, transportability, portability, ease and speed of deployment and of collapse, protection from the environment and aesthetics. Additionally the proposed solution effectively solves problems such as overcrowding providing comfortable housing. The shape allows for modular, close packing in a macro scale. This allows concentration of structures without overcrowding the living space. The structural framework is designed of aluminum with a resistant and light cross section providing durability, strength and making the structure light. Additionally the material can be reutilized for other structures as a recycled, modular component. The textile exterior is designed of Polycotton canvas making it cool and waterproof. The proposed solution has efficiently met most of the set benchmarks with a structurally stable, low-cost, rapid deployable structure.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Design</subject><subject source="lcsh">Structural stability</subject><subject source="lcsh">Civil Engineering</subject><subject source="lcsh">Cost effectiveness</subject><subject source="lcsh">Sustainability</subject><subject source="lcsh">Construction</subject><subject source="lcsh">Refugees</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref40_e9b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yang, Songyishu. <emph render="italic">Design for Sustainable Urban Agriculture in Abu Dhabi</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0037</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_7d1c905e1d38efe5523f21d7710f9866" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_32c1eca7ae03494000f777a255147c6d" parent="aspace_7d1c905e1d38efe5523f21d7710f9866" type="folder">2014-0037</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e855303a0c841121f3741a4eddb68fac"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Civil Engineering<lb/>Abstract: In an age of booming population and rapid urbanization, the lack of agricultural labor, shortage of arable land, and the increasing dominance of large food corporations all pose great challenges on the sustainability of urban food system. Urban agriculture might be a potential solution to these challenges. Farming in urban areas addresses at least three critical issues facing urban food infrastructure: food security, food quality and energy use as represented by food miles. Additionally, urban farming is socially beneficial in terms of ecological health, community development, and food awareness. In current practice, however, urban agriculture lacks three crucial building blocks: 1. Empirical economic studies to prove its economic viability (Glaeser). 2. Scalable business model to attract potential stakeholders from both public and private sectors. 3. Engineering smart and innovative farms that are adaptive to urban setting. This project is offers a design for a well engineered urban farms that are adaptive to the conditions and constraints of cities. Innovative water management, structural, environmental and traffic systems that are compatible with existing standards of safety and comfort, are proposed. The design allows a cost that will be competitive in the marketplace and acceptable to government.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Hydroponics</subject><subject source="lcsh">Civil Engineering</subject><subject source="lcsh">Traffic</subject><subject source="lcsh">Food</subject><subject source="lcsh">Water</subject><subject source="lcsh">Agriculture/Farms</subject><subject source="lcsh">Energy</subject><subject source="lcsh">Urban agriculture</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref361_guq" level="file"><did><unittitle>Andargie, Maendot Solomon, and Mingzhu Hou. <emph render="italic">Rapid Replacement Bridge Design</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0027</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_33594e3e7ebd911b1a5a07198befcc34" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_3042a966aceb176eda5b498f5da25e31" parent="aspace_33594e3e7ebd911b1a5a07198befcc34" type="folder">2015-0027</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_70af03ea0121fa0eb86477d2f7d671d6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Civil Engineering<lb/>Abstract, Maedot Andargie: We are designing a rapid replacement bridge located in Upstate New York.

This, alongside with a number of environmental concerns over the traditional construction practices, calls for an active investigation in new and innovative ways of designing structures. This project aims to design a modern educational building that is both cost-efficient and environmentally friendly. The proposed design integrates innovative materials and advanced building Science concepts and techniques that ensure a sustainable and efficient design. An well-planned design allows for the seamless integration of elements that allow light and natural air circulation as well as a comfortable interaction with the surrounding environment landscape. Thus, comfortable study conditions for the occupants are met while boosting the  building performance and minimizing its carbon footprint. With this in mind, the project aims to explore the use of EPS beads in ultra-lightweight concrete composite as the theoretical analysis suggests better thermal performance of the building.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_160823f53cd47ed80bb6f2e6966f71e8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Khan, Waqar Younas, and Abdur (Mani) Rehman. <emph render="italic">Room Design for Effective Evacuation under Escape Panic</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0058</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_eb2ab031e253e526754d67e6d84f71c9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5c279a2efbbf614e8425aeddb99db22e" parent="aspace_eb2ab031e253e526754d67e6d84f71c9" type="folder">2019-0058</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d1c8bbe464de08deb42299cb743421e7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The standards of evacuation design have not changed much in the past half a century. Any progress that is being made is so insignificant in value that the adoption of the ideas globally is not a priority. The 21st century is about minute detail optimization to achieve maximum efficiency. It is this search that is explained in the capstone where we try and understand the details and try to morph obstacles so as to help us achieve designs that lead to the goals we have set. In order to do this, inspiration from Dirk Helbing's work from 2001 was taken that discusses the possibility of improving evacuation rates by introducing obstacles in the pathway of an exit. The project delves further into this concept by trying to employ one or all of the following; deep neural networks, reinforced learning, and VISSIM. Based on the results obtained by Helbing, we expect that there is a certain design of obstacles that can improve the flow of pedestrians in an emergency evacuation. To answer this question, our research found that introducing funnel-shaped exits with a central kite-shaped obstacle produce the most efficient room design for evacuation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_81605de957012aff56e61d167d8f1e4e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Okoth, Victor, Raitis Pekuss, and Ylber Roka. <emph render="italic">Analysis of PWPB Algorithm for Incremental CAV Market Penetration Rates</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0048</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_176c3bd49cff73d765e0ffde127eb0b5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_9e70987fae2d17560fbece98ff66ba54" parent="aspace_176c3bd49cff73d765e0ffde127eb0b5" type="folder">2019-0048</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dd0def57b425212338a550cb0a305afe"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Connected and Autonomous Vehicles are widely expected to revolutionize urban transportation. Their increased presence is expected to mitigate traffic congestions, environmental hazards presented by vehicles, reduce the number of accidents while also increasing the throughput of traffic networks. However, these benefits will become apparent gradually corresponding to the gradual market penetration rates of CAVs. This paper studies traffic intersection control of mixed vehicle traffic that consists of CAVs as well as human driven vehicles. Specifically, we analyze the Position Back Pressure algorithm which is studied to outperform SCOOT - a widely accepted real-time adaptive traffic control method - in terms of delays for both low and high demand traffic conditions. We address the underlying assumption in the algorithm that all the information about vehicles in the network is known. Such a scenario is only possible with a 100% market penetration of CAVs and, therefore, does not reflect the real life conditions. To address this we vary the amount of known and, consequently, estimated data, which is then fed into the traffic simulation. As the result of this we can understand how sensitive is PWBP to inputs with varying levels of real and estimated data.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_4329056c35cee31dc6906c421ee36820" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Computer Engineering</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref373_s26" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alfergani, Noha H. <emph render="italic">Design of an Automatic Test Pattern Generation Tool for VLSI Transition Faults</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0030</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_f6ffd80c817cae17fb1a85776d4ef9b8" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_fdea510578b7bd04fc07e8c740955bde" parent="aspace_f6ffd80c817cae17fb1a85776d4ef9b8" type="folder">2015-0030</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_453218d4c9b665b0f2b30ba22679b555"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Computer Engineering<lb/>Abstract: Integrated circuits are extensively and universally utilized. Their applications vary from consumer products to mission critical electronics, creating a spectrum of susceptibility towards defects that accompany the manufacturing process. Thus, each electronic chip undergoes testing that determines whether the chip is defective or defect-free upon being manufactured. The testing process encompasses the application of carefully selected test patterns that produce an output which is observed and compared to an expected output. There are number of fault models that guide the testing process.  This project aims to create an Automatic Test Pattern Generation Tool, a software tool, targeting the transition delay fault model.  The test patterns generated by the software tool will then be used in the hardware component of the project. The test patterns will be applied to a desired circuit uploaded to an FPGA board to verify the output responses. The output will be verified by observing the output response to the expected output given the circuit under test. This is the test application phase of the project.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Testing chips</subject><subject source="local">Transitional delay faults</subject><subject source="lcsh">Computer engineering</subject><subject source="local">Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref371_ph8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chen, Jeffrey. <emph render="italic">Towards the Design of Intelligent 3D Computer Vision</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0026</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_a66db527ff0561fed4592f0145b7abac" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5f4c01a779a85d4140802543b1054331" parent="aspace_a66db527ff0561fed4592f0145b7abac" type="folder">2015-0026</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_80c5a1ba9363481f2edec9502024b439"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Computer Engineering<lb/>Abstract: This capstone project aims to design an intelligent framework for addressing such challenging issues from ever-growing 3D datasets. We intend to develop a system that takes 3D objects and presents them in various robust analytical models. Specifically, the proposed framework seeks to develop a cohesive and consistent shape analysis pipeline system that can correctly identify and preserve the important features of shapes. These important shape features will be processed and modelled into shape correspondences for 3D shapes registration, shape descriptors to evaluate the geometric similarities between shapes for 3D shape retrieval, and a clustering paradigm for discerning parts for 3D shape segmentation. The overall shape analysis pipeline is intended to deliver a standard process for capturing 3D object information from different analytical perspectives for further field-specific interests, such as categorization, detection, and representation. These perspectives are based in one-to-one, one-to-all, and introspective object comparisons that provide deep yet generally important understanding of shape features, opening them to further studies in matching, relating, and labelling.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Computer engineering</subject><subject source="lcsh">Geometry</subject><subject source="local">3D</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4fd4661476b9838084234962acad94ed" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alhosani, Hamdan Ahmed, and Hazem Ibrahim. <emph render="italic">SFLL-HD Logic Locking Framework</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0044</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ffd7039132dc005706f40db8ee7b55d3">IC netlists are valuable assets by nature since it holds the basic design of electronic chips.

Through the years, Virtual Reality (VR) simulators are becoming an essential part of modern dental education. Our project aims to design, develop, and evaluate a framework for simulating dentist-patient interaction using VR. Our project focuses on designing a three-dimensional model, through MakeHuman software, that is animated with different facial expressions, body movements, and vocal responses that can tell the dentist more about how the patient is feeling. The goal of our system is to present dental trainees with the basic communication skills and treatment acts that is required to deal with patients. The simulation we created is composed of three parts: pre-treatment, during treatment, and the post-treatment. There is a smooth transition between these scenarios, where the trainee is being tested on his or her dental performance accordingly. The dental simulation offers dentist-patient scenarios that include audio communication, visual communication, and an overall evaluation of the dentist's performance. The system was built on 3D Unity Game Engine, and was later tested on a group of dental students from the University of Sharjah (UOS), Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_99dc1f0056f296f4e61ab34c0f5fd28a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chirita, Daniel. <emph render="italic">Learning-Based Visual Tracking: Using PTZ Cameras to Track Commercial UAVs</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0062</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_8340f07e22b1139d11f4f4be1075a65f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_e7ddc6aa5f645f705d797e7bfb012cfa" parent="aspace_8340f07e22b1139d11f4f4be1075a65f" type="folder">2019-0062</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_29626a9df878ca4511d05184bd9ef3ff"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The goal of this capstone is to create a visual processing routine that detects and tracks airborne drones for security applications in airports, air bases, and other drone frequented locations.

Such camera systems have use in automatic surveillance in both indoor and outdoor locations. By embedding the zoom into the tracking routine, this project aims to extend functionality to over 100 m.

A Cosmic Ray Detector can be used to ionize muons striking the surface of the detector, thus conveying information about a given muon's position of hit, angle of hit and time interval between subsequent hits. Muon strikes are non-deterministic and the information they yield can be used as seeds to a True Random Number Detector (TRNG). In this work, a Quantum TRNG is proposed that translates position and angle of muon strikes into random numbers. Several designs are created and evaluated on the basis of the ability of the output to pass randomness tests and rate of throughput. The most robust design is incorporated as an online service that can be used to generate random numbers in real time.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_0f76f2b3ce0868b7412b2fde77fab45e" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>General Engineering</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref46_fjc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lin, Wei-Chung, and Sowani, Francis Thomas. <emph render="italic">Design of Automatic Test Pattern Generation System for VLSI Stuck-at-Faults</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0033</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_351d7b0776079321b592aef482c7f629" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_9f7bdde0f5ea1a84d531a25efef14db5" parent="aspace_351d7b0776079321b592aef482c7f629" type="folder">2014-0033</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4588ebde87247da0cc6ac76ccc21f128"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Engineering<lb/>Abstract: Applications vary from consumer electronics, such as phones and computers, to mission-critical ones such as those used for medical or avionics applications. Every chip is subjected to testing, as the manufacturing process is prone to defects. In the test process, a carefully selected set of input patterns are applied to chips, and the observed responses from the chip under test reveal whether the chip is good or bad. Today, the test process that aims at screening out the bad chips constitutes about 25-30% of the overall product cost.<lb/><lb/>The software system that produces the set of input patterns and their expected responses is called Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) system. It takes in a design netlist that describes circuit structure and a fault model that describes the targeted types of defects, and produces the test patterns. A traditionally used fault model is called the stuck-at fault model, which models defects that cause a net (wire) to be always stuck at 0 or 1, regardless of the actual value of the net.<lb/><lb/>This project aims at the design, development and evaluation of an ATPG system that targets only the stuck-at faults.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Testing chips</subject><subject source="local">Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Design</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b3f29c97005367c64adbd89bfbb00021" level="file"><did><unittitle>Filipovska, Monika. <emph render="italic">Transportation for Smart Cities</emph></unittitle><unitid>2017-0013</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2017/2017">2017</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_455a4ada08f34bb16da67788ebaf13d7">Transportation for smart cities, significantly based on modern data Science and traffic analytics, is entirely dependent on the availability of accurate knowledge of real-time traffic conditions.

The project focuses on developing a model for real-time traffic data reconstruction that allows for using the sparse data from instrumented road segments to accurately estimate the traffic conditions for segments that lack instrumentation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_7f9b6919603fd0d90f98fd3e316ae431" level="file"><did><unittitle>Carelli, Daniel, Jovan Jovancevic, and Kyler Meehan. <emph render="italic">reefRover</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0041</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_dce2a05b9333bed88c0719f6b986ead1">Coral reefs in the UAE are under threat of disappearance due to rising sea temperatures.

The biggest challenge is complexity in planning ahead for the burgeoning population with a keen consideration of electricity and water resources management, availability of adequate transport and communication infrastructure, and ease of accessing these public services. It has been observed that the population bleeds out of urban centres into peri-urban regions which are located between urban settings and their immediate rural surroundings. These regions are relatively untouched in terms of urban planning, but well within the economic reach and influence of nearby cities therefore they present a great potential for the next generation of urbanisation. This project explores new perspectives that can be brought to the construction industry to aid a shift towards a much needed sustainable practice, with emphasis on the environmental aspect. The design presented here is informed by background research and experiential work in the Solar Decathlon house project, and case studies conducted in Abu Dhabi and Dubai to benchmark practices that can be improved on and adopted for future undertakings.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_9a56ee5500059606a6e5c99f0f07dee4" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Mechanical Engineering</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref41_a3s" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kun, Janos Csaba, and Mohammed Omar. <emph render="italic">Design of an Inkjet Generator for Metal Oxide Nanostructures</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0034</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_eaa197e2630579f85e7829819b12ef6f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_7b39210e40e1a06a484809cda893f7f8" parent="aspace_eaa197e2630579f85e7829819b12ef6f" type="folder">2014-0034</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2ab71190739765c8df7177865ad096fa"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Mechanical Engineering<lb/>Abstract, Janos Kun: Our project aimed to create a cost-effective and simple nanostructure-production method based on an off-the-shelf inkjet printer cartridge.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_8808386d000fb5af96f326e1e1abcebd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Mechanical Engineering<lb/>Abstract, Mohammed Omar: This investigation deals with printing metal oxide nanostructures using inkjet technology as it is a much cheaper process than current processes of nanostructure synthesis. This is achieved by creating fine aerosol particles with an HP c6614 #20 inkjet cartridge and leveraging the so-called "coffee ring effect". Upon their deposition on a heated substrate, the aqueous droplets evaporate leaving behind porous nano-membranes. To be of any practical use, the inkjet aerosol generator had to create droplets on demand that have a diameter of less than 20μm, an initial velocity of 5m/s, a frequency of 1kHz and it should run for at least one hour continuously. Although, we fulfilled the first three specifications using the literature on our inkjet cartridge, the fourth was not. Our system however, finally synthesised ZnO porous nanomembranes which laid the foundation for future experimentation; our results were sufficient for our proof of concept. Future investigations would include studies on optimising the "throw distance" (defined as the distance from the inkjet nozzle to the substrate) to create the most useful nanostructures as well as creating a system that functions reliably for a practical time period.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Nanostructures</subject><subject source="lcsh">Aerosols</subject><subject source="lcsh">Ink-jet printing</subject><subject source="lcsh">Mechanical engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref369_61g" level="file"><did><unittitle>Algaribeh, Nour Radi Saleh, Israel Desta and Nahal Mustafa. <emph render="italic">Design of a Microfluidic Dispensing Machine for Caenorhabditis elegans worms</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0031</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_3f9a643ac16c12870f5b8c7301c017c5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_1da02e6d42cbb2b70d30a0e7424a9dd0" parent="aspace_3f9a643ac16c12870f5b8c7301c017c5" type="folder">2015-0031</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6a78b707b99e1f6374913e73355caf4a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Mechanical Engineering<lb/>Abstract: The aim of this capstone project is to design and build a microfluidic-dispensing device to dispense a single C.elegans worm at a time into each micro-plate well.

When a C.elegans worm passes through the channel and blocks the laser light to the photodiode, a change in light intensity is observed and that change is used to detect the passage of the worm. A LabVIEW program is developed to detect this change in intensity and actuate the pneumatic valves that will allow trapping and disposing of the worm.

The availability of this plant in the region makes it an affordable and reliable source to be incorporated in a water filter device. In addition, adding a compartment for sand and charcoal each makes the water filter more efficient at filtering out the physical, chemical and biological contaminants. In this capstone project, we aim to achieve an advanced multi-step xylem-based filter that can filter bacteria and heavy metals without blockage problems at an economical cost to people residing in developing regions who do not have access to potable water.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8ae5de97ad8042a056a3ce7c04d65642" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aldhaheri, Sara, and Alexander Leigh MacKay. <emph render="italic">GLiDAR: Design Optimization and Active Stabilization of LiDAR Sensor Payload for Surveying</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0060</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_957b0dc09ced319e414796365bce9db1" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_1d9a26c9a9d501e7cf1e815b8d89d054" parent="aspace_957b0dc09ced319e414796365bce9db1" type="folder">2019-0060</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_65b524db24cd566ac393fdc32cd82335"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The GLiDAR Capstone endeavours to enable the production of three-dimensional models that support the monitoring of changes to geographical features over time.GLiDAR applies advancements in solid-state LiDAR (Light Imaging, Detection, and Ranging) technology to address the challenges of expense, iterability, and data collection scale experienced in other surveying methods.Developed as an attachment for the Lockheed Martin INDAGO 3 Unmanned Aerial System, GLiDAR contributes to the field of aerial surveying by enabling the generation of high-quality, localized data to support landmass tracking.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_70464b528ea5836cf0d5d229a1fb20b7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Almasi, Bence A., Amal Badri, Veronica Lee, and Ushna Usman. <emph render="italic">Building a Low Cost Turbidostat</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0049</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_5e97050580bdc144bd1e90ad550a14a6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_b52c5d521a880330d0a471b40502b8e9" parent="aspace_5e97050580bdc144bd1e90ad550a14a6" type="folder">2019-0049</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b19dbf9c399368a755b8358382aa15e4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Continuous culture devices can be used for various purposes such as establishing reproducible growth conditions or maintaining cell populations under a constant environment for long time periods. To more accurately characterize biological systems, researchers must turn to static environments, which yield lower noise in quantitative phenotyping. A primary tool for culturing cells in a static environment is continuous culture, where inoculated growth medium is continually diluted with fresh medium. Turbidostats are powerful characterization tools that provide static culture environments; however, they are often expensive, especially when purchased in custom configurations, and are difficult to design and construct in a lab. Eight culture chambers are controlled simultaneously with the proposed configuration, and all components are readily available from various sources. We demonstrate that our continuous culture device can be used under different modes, and can easily be programmed to behave either as a turbidostat or fluorostat. Addition of fresh medium to the culture vessel is to be controlled by a real-time feedback loop or simply calibrated to deliver a defined volume. The project aims to build a device which is both cheaper and less laborious in comparison to the already existing commercial versions.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f23a21a570eb7742bb54a074f886b969" level="file"><did><unittitle>Castillo, Alberto, Pratik Maisuria, and Mahmoud Soliman. <emph render="italic">Reconstructing the Horologium of Harun Al-Rashid</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0066</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_b826c5a6baef0d4b80ed2beee5d9fd1a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ec84ec3e1906d8530243dc6a1e57ff46" parent="aspace_b826c5a6baef0d4b80ed2beee5d9fd1a" type="folder">2019-0066</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d8cbc0ed9835aec5a2e22e52c1eb372d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The following report details the reconstruction of the horologium of Harun al-Rashid from an engineering perspective.

It aids in food security by pro- viding control over all environmental factors, the preservation of endangered species of plants and the conservation of resources such as arable land and water. It is based on the finding that plants are best able to absorb particulate nutrients in a distance range of 1 to 50 micrometers (μm). Therefore, roots of the plants that are suspended within enclosed nutrient rich systems can better absorb and assimilate the minerals for more efficient farming with minimal water usage. Out of all available mineral nutrients, potassium ion (K+) plays particularly crucial role in plant growth and metabolism, and it is also the most abundant cation in plants.   The project aims to develop a micro scale sensor that monitors the real time uptake of K+ via roots that are directly exposed to the nutrient solution. The data collected can be further used to optimize the amount of nutrients needed by plant thus minimizing nutrient waste and producing crops of higher nutritional value.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_87fe018c7e858ff73ee9a5f0448cb51a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kasahara, Shunsuke. <emph render="italic">Design of a Bio-inspired Lizard Robot Mimicking Tail Autotomy Process</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0053</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_0f464d8ca24ee5fd7cec4c32469d13f4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5ef01c9349fc02065797cd8282d2e91b" parent="aspace_0f464d8ca24ee5fd7cec4c32469d13f4" type="folder">2019-0053</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e4e05e5667cc7259b67cebc7262af56f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Caudal autotomy is widespread among lizards: around 13 out of 20 families show this reflex severance strategy of their tails as a self-defence mechanism either to escape the predator's grasp or in anticipation of any life-threatening situation. The detached tail continues to wiggle (may go up to 30 minutes) through anaerobic metabolism and attracts the attention of the predator, which ultimately gives time to the lizard escape the ambush site. The mechanism of autotomy still remains secret. To explain this sheer bizarre phenomenon, we have developed a mechanistic model. Bio-inspired by the microstructures found on the broken tail surfaces, a bio-interlocking model containing an array of hemispherical microstructures was proposed. To test the model, a lab test setup was built and experiments on the biomimetic tail part were performed for its characterization. Finally, to demonstrate the actuatable interlock mechanism, a lizard robot was designed and fabricated. This robot detects incoming danger (incoming objects) and releases its tail while running away, as a real lizard would do. The robot and its tail shedding mechanism using the actuated bio-interlock was successfully tested.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0693564b1ee54f55a341d1401b83e7b6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kedia, Raghav, Gjorgji Shemov, and Jotham Varghese. <emph render="italic">A Radio-controlled Car with Dual Power Sources of Solar and Battery</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0047</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_402e3a916caf7947cf802085d93ce346" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_87de8e0d4cc7064765452f9540d355b7" parent="aspace_402e3a916caf7947cf802085d93ce346" type="folder">2019-0047</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a8af45c5694409b0b92f6b51f0c39641"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The project aims to design a 1:10 radio-controlled (RC) car powered by 1 Suoaki photovoltaic (PV) panel and 1 5000mAh Gens Ace Hardcase Li-Po battery, using SCX10 II™ 2000 Jeep® Cherokee as a model car.

As they are designed to sustain heavy loads, they are bulky and hence account for 30% of the nacelle weight (excluding the engine core).

The goal of this project is to design a thrust reverser system for high bypass ratio turbofan engines that uses fluidic injection to reverse the flow of air, eliminating the need of  mechanical blockers completely. The project validates "Blockerless Engine Thrust Reversers (BETR)" proposed by NASA Langley and culminates with the construction of a working model demonstrating the applicability of optimized design. This report summarizes the entire process of building an experimental model of a "Fluidic Injection Thrust Reverser (FITR)" system. A detailed experimental investigation showed that  ~71.5% of the fan flow (mass flow rate) with ~70% injection (in terms of fan flow). Operating at these parameters, the net negative thrust force readings reiterated our claim of achieving ~78% reversal of thrust through our implementation of FITR.</p></scopecontent></c></c></c><c id="aspace_840d11fce9c522905997a4cc34a63afa" level="series"><did><unittitle>Science Division Projects</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2019" type="inclusive">2014-2019</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_6a22ca46cb39fca45d953db6cc35a959" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Biology</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref60_lv9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Asfour, Leena Waddah. <emph render="italic">Implementation of a Peer-Mediated Health Education Model in the United Arab Emirates; Understanding Risky Behaviors Among Expatriate Teens</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0054</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_3e76f6e399406fa4da5be0a7a258d41d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_7915515280167c8827a4914bef8abba3" parent="aspace_3e76f6e399406fa4da5be0a7a258d41d" type="folder">2014-0054</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b8a602b506904d4cc39040bf2ad34741"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology<lb/>Abstract: In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), tobacco use amongst young people is on the rise, and the incidence of type II diabetes ranks the country at 15th in the world. Yet, few interventions directly address the risky behaviors that youth engage in, which lead to chronic, unhealthy habits. To test if an educational intervention would be effective in this cultural setting, we designed two peer-to-peer health workshops: one on tobacco use and another on nutrition/physical activity (N/PA). A pre-workshop survey was used to provide a baseline on the current attitudes, knowledge, perceptions and behaviors of our cohort with regard to tobacco use, physical activity and nutrition. We randomly assigned each classroom a workshop and used a post workshop survey to assess changes in the student's beliefs for each health topic. Our results provide a summary of the current risky behaviors of ninth grade expatriates in the UAE. Moreover, we concluded that the tobacco workshop positively affected knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of tobacco use. The N/PA workshop affected the teenagers' level of satisfaction with their physical activity. This study provides evidence to support a national adoption of a peer-to-peer health education model as a tobacco use intervention.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Health</subject><subject source="lcsh">Exercise</subject><subject source="lcsh">Nutrition</subject><subject source="lcsh">Tobacco</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref73_h7d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Drivdahl Dougherty, Kelly Alice. <emph render="italic">Mussaffah vs. New York: A High Throughput Phenotype-Genotype Study to Explore Adaptive Evolution in Green Algae</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0051</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_fa60dc53f656e5d772ca064b5b2705c9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_fd7f59cec95ab52348eee7c55da8658a" parent="aspace_fa60dc53f656e5d772ca064b5b2705c9" type="folder">2014-0051</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8142840f05688637348a1c9f07495e65"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology<lb/>Abstract: As the deciphering of algal metabolism becomes increasingly significant for algal optimization and its commercial applications, species' response and ultimately adaptation to environment becomes of particular practical interest. Because green algae can produce and accumulate lipids, the research model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been the subject of a large number of studies, including a genome-scale reconstruction of its metabolic network. The present study explores algal adaptation of three species, two from the USA and one from the UAE, to environment through temperature tolerance, metabolic capability, and genetics. High-throughput sequencing and metabolic phenotyping were used to define full metabolic profiles of these species and their phylogenetic assignments. Data indicates that while the isolates are closely related genetically across locations, and of the same species within the two locations, each strain has a unique metabolic profile and temperature range. This hints at epigenetic influence within locations, as well as intra-species phenotypic variations. Strains in the UAE displayed higher temperature tolerances. Strains from New York City showed lower, and different growth temperature preferences. Metabolic differences were observed across all strains, including between both strains from New York.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Green algae</subject><subject source="lcsh">Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</subject><subject source="local">High throughput phenotyping</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref69_i62" level="file"><did><unittitle>Haining, Brianna Leigh. <emph render="italic">Resolving Date Palm Biogeography through Analysis of the Chloroplast psbA-trnH Sequence</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0043</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_c52773cc22c3d5bb8ce7a99af6e80bfd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0445420a20d64b5b7ffb6cf04b870545" parent="aspace_c52773cc22c3d5bb8ce7a99af6e80bfd" type="folder">2014-0043</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_351cc8f0fcb8d26faa61ac6f058c4bdc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology <lb/>Abstract: Through the process of domestication, humankind has driven evolutionary change in a wide variety of plants.

This study aims to analyze the trends pertaining to supplement usage and perspectives in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. 200 weight-training participants were surveyed across 5 large gyms in the emirate. Results obtained saw high supplement usage, ranging from common protein supplements and creatine to suspected anabolic androgenic steroids. Major reasons for taking supplements, as reported by participants, were to "gain muscle mass", "improve athletic performance" and "reduce onset of muscle fatigue".

Diabetes prevalence among the UAE nationals were reported to be 24%, and 67% adults were obese or overweight, while 57% had central obesity [20,22]. The high prevalence of diabetes in the UAE is attributable to changes in lifestyle, yet the specific biochemical mechanisms that lead to  increased diabetes complications in this population is not known. In hyperglycemia, the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) through non-enzymatic glycation and oxidation of proteins is greatly accelerated [27]. The AGE/RAGE pathway has an important implication in the vascular damage that is observed in diabetes. This Capstone project is aimed to understand the epidemiology and the burden of diabetes worldwide and in the UAE, and to study the biochemical pathways that modulate diabetes complications.

The UAE is also ranked 15th in the world for incidence of type II diabetes. To test if an educational intervention would be effective in this cultural setting, we designed two peer-to-peer health workshops: one on tobacco and another on nutrition/physical activity (N/PA). We randomly assigned each classroom either a N/PA or tobacco workshop and used a post workshop survey to assess the effect of the workshops on the student's beliefs for each health topic. The N/PA workshop acted as a control group for tobacco related questions and vice versa. Our results provide a summary on the current risky behaviors of ninth grade expatriates in the UAE. Moreover, we concluded that the tobacco workshop positively affected knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of tobacco use, with noticeable spillover effects on perceptions of nutrition and physical activity as well. The N/PA workshop was only able to affect teenagers' level of satisfaction with their physical activity.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Diabetes</subject><subject source="lcsh">Tobacco</subject><subject source="lcsh">Health</subject><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Nutrition</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref64_ijv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Zarate-Rodriguez, Jorge. <emph render="italic">The Role of Microbiota in Shaping Host Physiology</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0049</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_f1e365cbdbf8e50676e733ac346353f8" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_78dee441f5814467e14fbb2edc6a573e" parent="aspace_f1e365cbdbf8e50676e733ac346353f8" type="folder">2014-0049</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4af82f5f6bb39957577f15e2f8973be6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology <lb/> Abstract: An altered intestinal microbiome and high-fat diet (HFD) can each contribute to obesity, this study tried to elucidate their combined effects on host physiology. Mice received sub-therapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT), whereas control mice did not. Both groups were fed normal chow (NC), and at 17 weeks half the mice were switched to HFD. STAT elevated total and fat mass in both NC and HFD mice compared to controls; a more substantial weight gain was observed when STAT and HFD were combined. To examine the effects on the microbiome, DNA was extracted from fecal samples and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Principal coordinate analysis revealed that both STAT and HFD changed microbial community structure. To determine whether an altered microbiota could cause an obesity phenotype independently of exposure to antibiotics, the microbiota of 18-week old control and STAT mice was transferred to germ-free mice via oral gavage. STAT-recipient mice showed significant increases in total and adipose mass compared to control. Histological analysis showed no difference in mean surface area or frequency distribution of adipocyte surface area between control and treatment groups.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Physiology</subject><subject source="lcsh">Obesity</subject><subject source="local">Microbiome</subject><subject source="lcsh">Antibiotics</subject><subject source="lcsh">Bacteria</subject><subject source="lcsh">Penicillin</subject><subject source="lcsh">Fat</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref399_sfr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Asfoor, Janeen Waddah. <emph render="italic">Designing Peptide Based Inhibitors of Amyloid Protein Misfolding and Cytotoxicity</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0034</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_ec68c414de81a5c63bd15657ae1e4dee" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_f106df9fe6c1cff22aa09385eb54f3af" parent="aspace_ec68c414de81a5c63bd15657ae1e4dee" type="folder">2015-0034</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_015b752b2628257653c8e6a88e64da2f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology<lb/>Abstract: Amyloid diseases, which include neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and prion diseases, are characterized by the misfolding, aggregation and toxicity of cellular proteins. Segments of prion proteins have been show to function as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which can cross the cell membrane with high efficiency even when coupled to large cargoes. In this study, a new peptide composed of a highly charged segment (KKLVFF) from the Aβ peptide, associated with Alzheimer's diseases, and a targeting sequence, was studied to determine whether it can function as a CPP and inhibit the aggregation and toxicity of Aβ. My studies show that the peptide effectively inhibited the aggregation of Aβ, was not toxic to cells, and rapidly entered cells and localized to the mitochondria, which has been suggested as a target in a number of amyloid diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Significantly, these findings give us insight into developing a 'universal inhibitor' of amyloid protein aggregation and cytotoxicity.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Cell-penetrating peptides</subject><subject source="lcsh">Aggregation, Cell</subject><subject source="local">Cytotoxicity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Amyloid</subject><subject source="lcsh">Alzheimer's disease</subject><subject source="lcsh">Peptides</subject><subject source="lcsh">Prion proteins</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref395_u5t" level="file"><did><unittitle>Edmonds, Victoria Susan. <emph render="italic">Audio-Visual Integration in Speech Perception</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0043</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_3178060610f2be049e721d35b81d70e2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_b24748863298e6be0c8dfa9e9c9c3a78" parent="aspace_3178060610f2be049e721d35b81d70e2" type="folder">2015-0043</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1c19eb9767ce3cccb5513ef928256185"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology<lb/>Abstract: This study investigates whether speech perception is primarily subserved by modality-specific or amodal representations by expanding the work reported by Kim et al. (2004). Visual speech was used to prime auditory and written targets across four conditions: repetition, non-repetition, same-onset, and same-rhyme. Lexical decision task (word vs. pseudoword) reaction times were used to assess the degree of priming. Selective repetition priming for both auditory and written LDT's was predicted. Results demonstrated facilitatory priming of repetition, same-onset, and same-rhyme conditions compared to control for both words and pseudowords in the auditory LDT. In the written LDT, repetition and same-onset priming was found to facilitate processing of words while repetition priming inhibited priming of pseudowords. Together, these results suggest that silent visual articulations do influence language perception, which is consistent with an amodal model of language perception dependent on an underlying motor bases. It remains unclear whether visual speech simply activates phonological units without lexical-specificity, as suggested by results of the auditory LDT, or whether it activates words in the mental lexicon, as suggested by results of the written LDT.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Perception</subject><subject source="lcsh">Speeches</subject><subject source="local">Cross-modal priming</subject><subject source="lcsh">Priming (Psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Visual speech perception</subject><subject source="lcsh">Speech perception</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref387_tyx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wickramasinghe, Nadheera Madhavi. <emph render="italic">Zelda's Regulatory Role in the Neuroepithelial-to-Neuroblast Transition in the Developing Drosophila Larval Brain</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0038</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_7f4fd3c86f4c12057c2b6205333d3af4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5932188cd3cc0bedd050791a4818580a" parent="aspace_7f4fd3c86f4c12057c2b6205333d3af4" type="folder">2015-0038</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5da5502c60aa5e57769ddcaf792684af"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology<lb/>Abstract: Zelda (Zld) is a transcription factor that is thought to coordinate the neuroepithelial (NE) stem cell network in the Drosophila larval brain. NE cells undergo differentiation to become neuroblasts (NB), which divide asymmetrically to maintain the correct balance of stem cells vs. differentiated cells. The NE-to-NB transition is controlled through the interaction of the EGFR and Notch signaling pathways. zld is expressed in NE cells of larval brains, and NE cells lacking Zld show early transformation into NBs. As such, we hypothesize that Zld is a possible regulator of the NE fate and thus integral to these pathways. The expression patterns of the Bearded (Brd), Ocho and escargot (esg) genes were assayed in wildtype and zld mutants as they are known to be expressed in NE cells. Zld was found to regulate the expression of Brd and esg, but not Ocho, suggesting that Zld only regulates certain genes involved in NE-to-NB transition. Many of the regulatory mechanisms involved in controlling NE cell fate are conserved between Drosophila and humans. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms through which Zld controls the NE-to-NB transition can lead to a better understanding of human neurodevelopmental diseases and brain tumors, as well as identifying targets for treatment.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Neural stem cells</subject><subject source="lcsh">Nervous system</subject><subject source="lcsh">Drosophila</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref480_umu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Batbold, Sarah. <emph render="italic">Investigating variation in Trichomonas vaginalis cytotoxicity and growth rate.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0045</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_fa9902e8986816ca5dc519e728933e31">Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated parasitic protist and the causative agent of trichomoniasis, the world's most prevalent non-viral STI.

Here we provide evidence that in the developing optic lobes of Drosophila, the NBs in the ventral tip of the Inner Proliferation Center do not progress though a temporal transcription factor series, yet still manage to schedule apoptosis.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref473_4yj" level="file"><did><unittitle>Shraim, Rasha. <emph render="italic">Influence of environmental extremes on reef fish trophic ecology: A metagenomics approach.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0078</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b8be4133cec343bc70015fe88e0e691b">The Arabian Gulf constitutes a harsh environment for marine life.

The RNA motif of interest, N15, was found to carry out catalysis despite its stem-loop II structure being shorter. Two structural conformations were found to stabilize the core of the minimal N15min7, LCI (loop II-core interaction) and LSI (loop II-loop I interactions), which then facilitate catalytic activity of the RNA molecule. To further examine the HHR, N15min7 was assayed at 1 mM of MgCl2 to determine if these interactions are maintained at lower concentrations of divalent metal ions. When assaying the wild-type (WT) N15min7, LSI and LCI structures with deoxy-base substitution at lower concentrations of MgCl2, no significant difference in catalytic activity was observed among these three structures, indicating that an alternative interaction is taking place. Our results indicate that despite an overly simplistic structure, the N15min7 requires multiple interactions to catalyze self-cleavage at varying concentrations of divalent metal ions. Furthermore, the biological relevance of the N15min7 motif was determined by extensive computational searches for N15min7-like structures in a collection of ~8,000 genomes. The search identified ~100 instances of N15min7 sequences that can potentially form catalytically active structures.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ba9f2bd6b4a06e33810c053ec17b740d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Baby, Dhanya. <emph render="italic">Generation of a Wolbachia Secretome Resource for High-Throughput Analysis of Lymphatic Filariasis</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0071</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_644204eccc1bcc9f9f4cab5c69efb8c3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_4ba8756c15ec4658585396cefe1bd0cc" parent="aspace_644204eccc1bcc9f9f4cab5c69efb8c3" type="folder">2018-0071</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_006bb7caae197342ae6c57cba96820b8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Lymphatic filariasis is caused by the parasitic nematode, Brugia malayi. These roundworms persist in the human host for years, and the suspected mechanism is immunomodulation of the human immune system. Most of the filarial nematodes including B. malayi harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia in their lateral chords. The goal of this project was to generate a comprehensive resource to enable functional proteomics studies of the interactions between Wolbachia and human. We produced an Open Reading Frame (ORF) resource for high-throughput experimentation by synthesizing a subset of ORFs of secreted Wolbachial proteins. We successfully cloned over 80% of our synthesized ORFs into two destination vectors optimized for high-throughput experimentation, namely Yeast 2-Hybrid screening and protein expression. Gene expression analysis indicated genes up-regulated during infectious stages were associated with protein folding and chaperone functions, suggesting a likelihood of increased protein production during infectious stages. We also conducted in silico protein analysis to understand the function of protein products in our subset. Our genome-scale Yeast 2-Hybrid Screen with our cloned ORFs against the human ORFeome yielded 3 of the Wolbachial proteins, involved in DNA repair, potentially interacting with human gene products.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_016ecd98ce145c46fdf1fd3d5e3de717" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bhagani, Humna. <emph render="italic">Exploring the role of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein CBF-A in neuronal development </emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0070</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_c2dd0365ff2cfc95cbb3f2813ee12b19" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_dc9742b505754945626c7347818c240d" parent="aspace_c2dd0365ff2cfc95cbb3f2813ee12b19" type="folder">2018-0070</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fcf156ad58cc5e7b4be0d5a3f968535f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression is an essential mechanism that controls development and differentiation in cells. Here, we focused on the role of the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein CBF-A, known to regulate mRNA transport by binding the RNA trafficking sequence located on the 3' UTR of mRNA transcripts. We applied genome wide approaches to MEFs from a CBF-A KO mouse to examine whether CBF-A mediates RNA trafficking at an early stage during RNA biogenesis in developing neurons. RNA-seq analysis of CBF-A KO and heterozygous (HT) MEFs showed that there are many neuronal genes altered in the absence of CBF-A. We then chemically reprogrammed CBF-A KO and HT MEFs into neuron-like cells. Immunostaining confirmed differential expression of neuronal markers. To begin characterizing the induced neurons, we tested 150 neuronal and fibroblast- specific primers on WT MEFs and reprogrammed neurons to create a primer profile for future analyses. Results from this study confirm a primary role of CBF-A in RNA biogenesis and begins to highlight its importance in achievement of cell fate during neuronal development.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_a8f149558cd912512d1c44eaf9bfa1c6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Choi, JooHee. <emph render="italic">Characterizing the Transposable Element Landscape of Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera)</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0052</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_cc44bc3cc736a1afcc2eaa81fd696d86" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_2c7425a95cb3d5aa9eb91ac5098c3ff0" parent="aspace_cc44bc3cc736a1afcc2eaa81fd696d86" type="folder">2018-0052</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a53fae59d74c1def5e8f339c614141ed"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) is a culturally and economically important crop across the Middle East, South Asia, and Northern Africa- yet our understanding of its genome remains relatively limited. This study aims to detect and characterize the transposable element (TE) landscape in this significant species through a novel combination of both library-based (Repeatmodeler) and k-mer based (REPdenovo) computational methods. The resulting consensus reads were masked via Repeatmasker and mapped to a gene map (NCBI: GCF_000413155.1_DPV01). Of the 500Mb genome assmbly, 38% was annotated as repetitive elements, of which LTR Copia and Gypsy were predominant. Comparison of element length and divergence indicate that LTR Copia elements are likely young and recently active. When mapped against regions upstream and downstream to genes, there was a relative abundance of Gypsy upstream compared to Copia, that may suggest an innate insertion bias at play. Of the elements uniquely assembled by REPdenovo, a majority were identified as plastid-derived sequences. Estimates suggest approximately 0.2% of the date palm genome consists of such elements, highlighting a category of plant DNA often overlooked. Through this study, we provide a TE-level understanding of the date palm genome structure that may act as a "roadmap" in future palm studies.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_3c4456490745e6a7cb28a04abc9f5bc4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Degutis, Karolis. <emph render="italic">Investigation of Top-down and Bottom-up Signals in Visual Working Memory in V1</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0076</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_7b4acaaa9dd1edea7b6baf400af368df" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_181b49320d254a71045d241d7d56e94e" parent="aspace_7b4acaaa9dd1edea7b6baf400af368df" type="folder">2018-0076</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cd419f36daf316bf4639ac0209c3fad6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Working memory (WM) allows for the maintenance of information over short periods of time when the initial source of the information is no longer present. In this study, we investigated whether the visual WM signal in the primary visual cortex (V1) is top-down or bottom-up using 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A top-down signal would indicate storage of visual WM outside of V1, while a bottom-up signal would indicate V1 maintenance. The direction of the signal was operationalized with an Attention and Perception task; each one activating distinct neural populations within V1. These patterns of activity were then compared using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to the pattern elicited from a visual WM task. The study replicated previous results by finding orientation-selective information present in V1 without a high-amplitude sustained BOLD response. We also found significant similarity between the patterns of the visual WM and Attention tasks. These results suggest a top-down signal in V1 during the maintenance of visual WM, consistent with the idea that visual WM is not maintained within V1.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_83468e067039826963990dc1573f9549" level="file"><did><unittitle>Fadil, Chaimaa. <emph render="italic">Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling of the Drosophila Optic Lobe Suggests a Regulation of Terminal Characters by Cell Type-Specific Transcription Factor Cohorts</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0094</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_b39bd8e6e48852898cd65e355882d036" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_4024c25fcd5076b75ad598d2eb6cd7e0" parent="aspace_b39bd8e6e48852898cd65e355882d036" type="folder">2018-0094</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5c6a8a1f597e4d3d4a5a456974c50ed5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Understanding how a system comes to be and what its different components are is critical to deciphering its mode of action. In multicellular organisms, it is now established that transcription factors expressed during development play a key role in specifying cell fate. However, to better encompass cellular diversity, we are yet to understand how molecular specification translates into character acquisition. This study takes a holistic and unbiased approach to molecularly characterize cellular diversity in the adult Drosophila optic lobe based on Drop-seq single-cell RNA-seq of 57,000 cells. With unsupervised analysis and differential expression testing, I identified 52 clusters of transcriptionally distinct single-cell populations. I annotated several clusters by correspondence to known cell types on the basis of canonical markers or by characterizing cells' localization and projection patterns using Gal4 lines. Regulatory interactions between the transcription factors apterous and traffic-jam and the respective markers of cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons, ChAT and VGlut, were confirmed by gene knock-down through RNAi. Interestingly, these results, in addition to a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), showed that cell types with similar phenotypes do not necessarily share the same transcription factor signature, thus suggesting that phenotypic convergence is a likely cellular evolutionary model in Drosophila.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6289011fc74d4d7f093bfed3fd0e44c8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Govind, Jigar. <emph render="italic">Long-Term Balancing Selection at MHC class I loci in the Ethiopian frog Leptopelis gramineus</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0077</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_05bd44d113b28df6f5e34c5e3d227da1" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_cbd80028840d3263a9de333a93becd16" parent="aspace_05bd44d113b28df6f5e34c5e3d227da1" type="folder">2018-0077</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3b70bdd4edf1d38f1e9845bfecdd8734"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In the defense against diseases, organisms must maintain a repertoire of molecules that can respond to the variety of pathogens in their habitat. The variety of pathogenic threats present in one's surroundings depends on several environmental variables, including climate. Here I isolated and analyzed class I MHC sequences from the Ethiopian frog Leptopelis gramineus, sampled across a heterogeneous habitat range, to investigate the relationship between demography, population structure and climate in the context of immunogenetic variation. I hypothesized that the signature of balancing selection is stronger in warmer climates. I used neutral markers to reconstruct the demographic history of each clade belonging to L. gramineus, measured genetic diversity, differentiation, and gene flow, and simulated these measures against neutral scenarios. While intra-specific subpopulation Tajima's D and Fu and Li's analyses revealed strong evidence for balancing selection, inter-specific analysis revealed a lack of clear genetic structure at MHC class I loci with respect to differences in clade, elevation difference, and geographical distance. Instead, the data demonstrate clear effects of long-term balancing selection that may predate the spatial dispersal of L. gramineus across Ethiopia.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f0bd600fc1bf82f75c1e2e9eeefcb7fd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jankauskas, Robertas. <emph render="italic">During differentiation nuclear beta-actin regulates neuronal gene programs</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0064</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_137e2be6f3090f7e9d9ef23ad9ac7d00" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0ca13eaeb0198e8ee91a78d9e130f622" parent="aspace_137e2be6f3090f7e9d9ef23ad9ac7d00" type="folder">2018-0064</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a878d1551cc374b758e44a0039b3eb1a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>During the process of cellular differentiation global changes in chromatin lead to genome organization and the suppression and activation of gene programs. Emerging evidence indicates that nuclear β-actin is a major regulator of genome organization. β-actin performs this important function by regulating genomic deposition of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex. This leads to tethering of heterochromatin to the NL while controlling the level of euchromatin. To further study the role of nuclear actin in these processes and its potential impact on development and differentiation, here we implemented a direct reprogramming protocol on embryonic fibroblasts from a β-actin knockout mouse to directly reprogram them into induced neurons. We report differences in neuronal morphology between WT, HET, and KO cell lines arising from differential gene expression levels. Many of the compromised genes were found to be downregulated in a β-acting dosage dependent manner. GO term analysis found that these changes compromised programs related to neuronal development. Reintroducing an NLS containing β-actin in the KO cells positively affected neuron specific marker expression. Because the model organism is embryonic lethal at developmental stage 10.5 we conclude that nuclear β-actin helps regulate neuronal gene expression during development.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8478f5c17a32437ca08b25edae26695a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kirwan, Liam Ingmar. <emph render="italic">Identification of Natural Products from Sponge/Tunicate-Associated Bacterial Species in the Abu Dhabi Region</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0072</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_15c65ab2d2c6111802a125e0f11d017a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_a092b8f2a90fe28077500d3faa0ee0f5" parent="aspace_15c65ab2d2c6111802a125e0f11d017a" type="folder">2018-0072</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f8eb811b94fbee370a0fa0f248db3a3c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Marine invertebrate-associated bacteria are a promising source of natural products, especially in harsh conditions (such as Abu Dhabi) where metabolitefacilitated adaptation is necessary.

Previous RNA-seq analysis identified the top 10 upregulated TEs in uhrf1 mutants as compared to wild type (WT) larvae. Here, I analyzed the genomic features of these TEs and their pattern of expression by in situ hybridization (ISH). Bioinformatics analysis showed a significant correlation (r=0.6328 for WT and r=0.5871 for uhrf1 mutants) between read counts and number of full length reads. ISH showed significant expression of TEs in both the WT and uhrf1 mutant larvae, particularly in the brain, eyes and jaws. In the mutants, we observed a difference in signal in some TEs, but not major differences in the pattern of expression between WT and uhrf1 mutants. Phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptase domains of the LTR Gypsy elements showed that Gypsy117-I_DR expressed the greatest fold change.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9082f3e973340304c82f31ba0ee55e3c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mo, Ziyi. <emph render="italic">Phylogenetics of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) and closely related wild species elucidates the nature of introgressive hybridization between North African date palm and Phoenix theophrasti</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0086</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_4dce2c7e227075bd23210760f8cdfae1" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5bfc7be97cc1e9e57a51d77d5446ec0c" parent="aspace_4dce2c7e227075bd23210760f8cdfae1" type="folder">2018-0086</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d1be175ba41f75d8c43be08f700c0d20"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The domestication history of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), an important staple crop in the Middle East and North Africa, is not well understood. The popular model of domestication argues that date palm originated from the Middle East and later spread westward to North Africa via trade routes. However, higher observed nucleotide diversity within the North African date palm population suggests that the North African population is not the product of recent colonization, thereby contradicting the model. This study of 71 date palm cultivars from across Middle East and North Africa and 6 of its closely related wild species reconciles the higher observed nucleotide diversity in North African population and the popular domestication model by demonstrating that the North African date palm population is a result of introgressive hybridization between date palm and P. theophrasti. Linkage disequilibrium analysis and phylogeny of phased haplotypes in highly introgressed genomic region provide evidence for intro- gression, whereas chloroplast and mitochondrial phylogeny reveals that hybridization occurred through pollination of date palm offshoots by P. theophrasti.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_73be677575e49a3897e94d1196fa8348" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nehme, Mona. <emph render="italic">Adaptation of mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation Genes to High Altitude in Leptopelis gramineus</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0049</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_9de217e6df23121b0ae9f3e129321a73" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_9efee6cf1e6d14e23ef19569b33f7351" parent="aspace_9de217e6df23121b0ae9f3e129321a73" type="folder">2018-0049</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5c5943f3a5d67635c6aa6c6493ed9807"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Harsh environmental conditions are common characteristics of high altitudes, such as those in the Ethiopian highlands. This can be detrimental to the survival of maladapted organisms, yet these areas continue to be biodiversity hotspots. This alludes to adaptive selection that equips high altitude organisms, such as Ethiopian endemic frog Leptopelis gramineus , with the capacity to survive in hazardous conditions. The mitochondrial genome has been previously shown to be crucial in adaptation due to it comprising of rapidly evolving non-recombining sequences. In this paper, I studied the role played by mtOXPHOS genes in adaptation to high altitude in L. gramineus using aBSREL, FEL, and MEME analytical methods . Diversifying selection was found in codons 42 in ATP8 and 311 and 317 in ND1. However, this selection could not be attributed to adaptation to high altitude considering the individuals who expressed the necessary mutations were collected from varying altitudes. The result could also potentially be related to incomplete lineage sorting resulting from high mutation rates in the addressed codon positions. Therefore, further analysis is needed in order to determine the role of ATP8 and ND1 on L. gramineus high altitude adaptation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_afb15db1862303ae72aac671ff3177e0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Šabanović, Merima. <emph render="italic">What it takes to be at the top: The complex interrelationship between chronic social stress and social dominance</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0103</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_d50fa6f6352f5c9f41f6c8834bc97c77" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_f5e669d8b37181b7c1fc45ca81f15e09" parent="aspace_d50fa6f6352f5c9f41f6c8834bc97c77" type="folder">2018-0103</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bf4e48c8c72f71caf5bdf5dbd9205ea3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Most animal societies are organized in dominance hierarchies that affect an individual's reproductive success and access to resources. Exposure to stress is one of many complex factors contributing to hierarchy formation, but a hierarchical status itself can be stress-inducing. I aimed to elucidate the complex relationship between stress and dominance by delineating how social rank predicts vulnerability to social stress and whether chronic stress modulates hierarchy establishment. Using the C57 mouse model, hierarchical rank is studied using an automated social confrontation tube test that is consistent with at least three other dominance measures. Chronic social stress is mimicked by the chronic social defeat (CSD) paradigm that induces a depressive-like phenotype in stress-susceptible mice. I show that exposure to chronic stress predicts higher success in subsequent hierarchy formation. The mice that underwent CSD exhibited markedly higher winning ratios than their stress-naïve conspecifics. Results also suggest that the differences in social competitiveness are not related to the overall differences in stress-susceptibility, but hierarchical status may predispose the subordinate ranks to decreased baseline social preference. In contrast, dominant males are liable to higher anxious-like behavior following CSD-stress. Furthermore, I also demonstrate how individual housing conditions markedly increases a range of anxiety-like behaviors. I additionally report preliminary data on a neural circuit potentially underlying dominance- and stress-specific signal integration.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_15882bd36384814b240f5e712049a578" level="file"><did><unittitle>Saleh, Hadi Omar. <emph render="italic">CPP-Cargo Complex Translocation in Model Membrane Systems: Experiments and Simulations</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0057</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_0bf1e639ceb2e5bcfe97c84e24a5ab79" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_685cc65cfdc77a6db3e14f00ba7de1ad" parent="aspace_0bf1e639ceb2e5bcfe97c84e24a5ab79" type="folder">2018-0057</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b399b01c249a2d2c67328092616cceb9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Cancer is a disease of multicellular organisms characterized by uncontrolled cell division.

However, the the current knowledge of its global role in transcription remains limited. Using high-content screening of embryonic fibroblasts from NMIknockout (KO) mouse, we report significant changes in histone modifications, such as acetylated histone(H)3-lysine-(K)9 and acetylated histone(H)3-lysine-(K)27, marker of active transcription and active enhancer regions respectively. Confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis confirmed the reorganization of chromatin structure and histone modifications in the absence of NMI. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that these genome-wide changes in the level of histone modifications are accompanied by a significant differential expression of genes associated with cellular response to DNA damage and DNA repair. We propose that NMI plays an important role in establishing histone modifications through its interaction with chromatin remodeling complexes, leading to proper activation of DNA damage response gene programs.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_94b4fa7168898ea785b14e5845aa9a94" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wunsche, Leonore. <emph render="italic">Endoplasmic Reticulum Morphology as an Indicator for Stress Severity</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0066</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_eb11c1c577441944190d1b61335b8a42" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_73dce528238194efe9a9ec7ff032fa8a" parent="aspace_eb11c1c577441944190d1b61335b8a42" type="folder">2018-0066</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a86b8ac4f24e46c2b7cf9ab3c99b30d0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) serves to counteract the accumulation of proteins in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) during stress. The initial phases of the UPR are adaptive, but chronic activation leads to cell dysfunction and pathology, such as steatosis. We reasoned that alterations in ER morphology would occur during an adaptive phase, where ER phenotypes could indicate early stress responses. We tested this utilizing intravital confocal imaging of 5 dpf transgenic zebrafish expressing a hepatocyte specific ER marker. We defined seven ER phenotypes in during various stress conditions (tunicamycin, ethanol, trappc11 and nAtf6) and scored for their prevalence. Tunicamycin, a well-established ER-stressor, caused motile punctae which retained the fluorescent ER label. These emerged at 12 hours and were present in 74% of larvae after 24 hours of tunicamycin exposure. Furthermore, the ER punctae colocalised with LysoTracker, a fluorescent dye staining acidic structures. Gene expression analysis showed UPR target gene upregulation in livers from larvae with extensive ER punctae prevalence, compared to those looking like controls. Thus, our ER marker represents a proxy for identifying ER stress states, where morphology changes can indicate the fish most prone to disease.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_87d055e5581d28defda168577dcac4a4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jansen, Gloria. <emph render="italic">Effect of Chronic Social Stress on Homeostatic Sleep Response</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0065</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_2049418e3f912659489f72e50ad86588" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_943a552fc1a066a465dd11e6a41c63b1" parent="aspace_2049418e3f912659489f72e50ad86588" type="folder">2018-0065</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_146e377ef99c98aa24b7c78a976adfcf"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A remarkably conserved behavior, sleep is thought to restore neural circuits and their synaptic outputs.

Combining electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis with transcriptomics of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) in the midbrain, we investigated homeostatic sleep response after 4-hour total sleep deprivation (TSD) in stress-susceptible and -resilient mice. Susceptible mice spent an average 9% more time in REM rebound sleep, while resilient mice exhibited elevated non-REM (NREM) sleep following TSD. Prolonging time awake by TSD had differential effects on expression of synaptic plasticity genes Arc and BDNF, potassium channels and neuroinflammatory genes in susceptible and resilient groups.

One commonly accepted theory claims that information is maintained in WM through 'persistent neural activity'. This refers to the idea that neurons keep information active through constant firing despite the fact that the information is no longer present. Recent evidence indicates that memories are also potentially stored through 'activity-silent' states, where the functional architecture of the neural network is altered in a way that memories instead of being active representations are being stored as a silent pattern of synaptic weights. While this 'activity-silent' model could provide a compelling explanation for some neural data, it doesn't constitute conclusive evidence yet. The overall aim of this research is to propose a novel way to evaluate the two potential models of visual WM, thus providing further evidence for potential mechanisms that could possibly present in WM. We tested this hypothesis behaviorally using a continuous report WM task, and neurally using functional MRI (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to uncover patterns of brain activity that contained information about WM items.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_43fd1d4e50982750c3c2a0ee70e025cb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al-Ajlouni, Yazan. <emph render="italic">Investigating the Association between Midwakh smoking behaviors and risk factors of Cardiovascular Disease and Hypertension among UAE nationals: Findings from the UAE Healthy Future Study.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0092</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_861a63ced87fcc13774dca09e9927ff0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_4dbc716e1efd83c67a6b4d07f4838a60" parent="aspace_861a63ced87fcc13774dca09e9927ff0" type="folder">2019-0092</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f6589e29facabb2bcbc690e91c6ba812"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Midwakh is an emerging type of smoking, specifically popular among the youth in the Arab gulf region.

Although a variety of management efforts have been put in place, there is currently limited information on the population dynamics of fish species in the UAE. This information is crucial to guide the development of Mrine Protected Areas. This study explored the population structure of four commercially important fish species in the UAE: Diagramma pictum (painted sweetlips), Carangoides bajad (orange-spotted trevally), Epinephelus coioides (orange-spotted grouper), and Lethrinus borbonicus (snubnose emperor). Using RADsequencing we report evidence of a significant population structure within D. pictum that divides the species into two populations across the southern Arabian Gulf. The other three species, C. bajad, E. coioides, and L. borbonicus, did not reveal a population structure, suggesting that this population homogeneity could potentially be a result of adult spawning aggregates or larval dispersal. The results have important implications for informing the design of future Marine Protected Areas in the southern Arabian Gulf.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_784d89ddc006e26545801bc4304a500b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aqel, Hala. <emph render="italic">Jet Lag as a Global Stressor: Effect of Shifting Light on Depressive-Like Behavior and Stress Susceptibility</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0096</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_61076709efb0b0ca9df1d89521d709f8" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_32f6933c9c4068524ea3620aaa24b3f3" parent="aspace_61076709efb0b0ca9df1d89521d709f8" type="folder">2019-0096</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_efdff9aa1abe4b0645c2f6c33b7c198a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a disease increasing in occurrence globally. One of the most significant factors contributing to the prevalence of depression is disruption of natural human circadian rhythmicity due to extended exposure to light in our technologically-driven societies. A well-studied stress paradigm of chronic social stress is mimicked by the chronic social defeat (CSD) paradigm that induces a distinct, robust depressive-like phenotype in stress-susceptible mice. Due to evidence indicating that shifting light cycles and mood are interconnected, I aim to investigate whether a chronic jet lag paradigm modelled in mice produces depression-like behavior comparable to the chronic social defeat paradigm. Although results are not statistically significant, qualitative analyses indicate that a chronic jet lag model is a comparable stressor, if not a stronger stressor, than chronic social stress.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f7418d02cf0917b0c8092e2b96f18733" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chang, Yoonhoo. <emph render="italic">Investigating IgM response to P.falciparum infection</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0091</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_2e47c085a564c7620dc757a2e4735f4c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_2a9273d39105bdcd44286b4a65a3c9ca" parent="aspace_2e47c085a564c7620dc757a2e4735f4c" type="folder">2019-0091</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f55088cf9bbcf929a66fc7ba73563e5c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>During the blood stage of malaria infection, invasion and multiplication of the Plasmodium parasites cause symptoms ranging from fever and chills to vital organ dysfunction. One of the most important factors source of variation in the severity of such symptoms is the host immune system. Host immune system consists of multiple layers of defense, but the ultimate step of an efficient response to clear the parasites is the production of immunoglobulins. Here we focus on immunoglobulins M (IgM) with the aim to clarify the nature of IgM changes taking place during the course of Plasmodium falciparum infection and if these changes are controlled by host genotype. The study population is a pediatric cohort in Burkina Faso, consisting of children sampled before infection, during asymptomatic infection, during symptomatic infection and three weeks after treatment. IgM levels were quantified using ELISA and compared between the four groups and tested for association with parasitemia in the symptomatic infection group. Furthermore, we report genetic variants in candidate genes associated with IgM levels. Combined, these results document changes of IgM levels in vivo in a pediatric cohort in Africa and show how host genotype can modulate IgM response to Plasmodium falciparum.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_676d702c14af3ea73ff30798ce12a028" level="file"><did><unittitle> Farrukh, Sannia. <emph render="italic">DNA damage dependent regulation of p53 pathway by Nuclear Myosin I</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0081</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_63b00c57f3aaa0873ba6b54327104c48" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ca38f17e7bdfb60192b91782e83e70d7" parent="aspace_63b00c57f3aaa0873ba6b54327104c48" type="folder">2019-0081</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_797accbf48cec7673307848661f23f78"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Nuclear myosin 1 (NM1) is an emerging key regulator of transcription and chromatin organization. It has been implicated in several nuclear processes involving chromatin remodeling and histone modifications. Recent studies have highlighted the role of myosins in DNA repair, however how NM1 regulates that pathway is still unknown. Using NM1 knockout mouse fibroblasts, we show that NM1 gene deletion leads to differential expression of genes involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle. We found that genes that are downstream p53 signaling are down regulated and that cells lacking NM1 display constitutive DNA damage foci. Based on these observations, we silenced NM1 by siRNA to study its function in response to DNA damage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and qPCR analyses on cells subjected to NM1 knockdown revealed that NM1 binding to the p21 gene is enhanced upon DNA damage. These results also showed that NM1 facilitates the binding of PCAF and Set1 to the p21 gene, leading to active expression of the p21 gene. Thus, we propose that NM1 plays a regulatory role in the p53 signaling pathway and is recruited across the p21 gene to facilitate recruitment of histone modifiers that induces histone acetylation and methylation, facilitating p21 gene activation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_837f8ca95397b23cb18c8bbc373935a8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gjorgjieva, Tamara. <emph render="italic">The role of β-actin in the direct reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to osteoblast-like cells</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0124</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_19baa1326406cc25b026d498d254b935" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_8cffaa801574b035bff689e0ebd1719b" parent="aspace_19baa1326406cc25b026d498d254b935" type="folder">2019-0124</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_41fda6ef3e81ce55f5ee30615a57c07e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Actin has many functions in the nucleus. Our lab recently showed that the loss of β-actin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) leads to differential expression of gene programs related to development and differentiation, including neurogenesis. In this study, we directly reprogrammed MEFs to osteoblast-like cells. Firstly, we showed that mineralization of the extracellular matrix correlates with β-actin level: β-actin-/- KO cells show mineralization after 4 days, whereas β-actin+/-HET and β-actin+/+ WT cells require 8 and 14 days, respectively. Using Scanning Electron Microscopy, we also observed hydroxyapatite-like polycrystalline structures secreted exclusively by KO cells on day 4. We also performed RNA-seq analysis on all the CiOsteo cells, and found genes related to osteogenesis that are dysregulated between WT and KO CiOsteo cells. Lastly, we identified increased heterochromatization at the loci of key regulatory genes, such as Msx1 and Mmp13 that are downregulated in KO CiOsteo. In summary, we propose that β-actin is required for regulating the chromatin accessibility during direct reprogramming: in the absence of β-actin, key regulatory genes remain heterochromatinized and thus not transcribed, resulting in a hypermineralization phenotype.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_27414be8cf565a9ebcbfdb1a919b890f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hariyani, Imtiyaz Enayatali. <emph render="italic">Speciation and transposable element amplification in the Ethiopian frog species Ptychadena neumanni</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0112</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_d09bef7a92f65f7bf3722c36da63c15c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_90f1fd865d915f764cd36faca87bf0e7" parent="aspace_d09bef7a92f65f7bf3722c36da63c15c" type="folder">2019-0112</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9567a663cb6fa9d9f3fe3cea6f7b796a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Transposable elements (TEs) exhibit high variation in diversity and copy number in vertebrates, which has important evolutionary implications as they constitute a source of evolutionary novelties. The dynamics of TEs are strongly affected by factors such as host demography. In small populations, genetic drift opposes the effect of negative selection and can result in the fixation of TE insertions that would be eliminated in large populations. The carrier subpopulation hypothesis predicts that population subdivision caused by vicariance or dispersal may trigger fixation of TE families by genetic drift. We used the Ethiopian Ptychadena neumanni species complex to test this hypothesis and to investigate any relation between speciation and TE amplification. Using a high-quality genome sequence for P. cf. neumanni 2, we identified 2342 repeat families de novo using RepeatModeler and characterized the repeat landscape of the frog using RepeatMasker. Resequencing data from six closely related frog species were used to identify mobile element insertions that differ among species. Our analysis revealed that the amplification of TEs is consistent with the evolutionary history of the host inferred by SNPs. We also observed substantial differences in the rate of amplification of TEs between species.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_474dd3abfa59d66bf8a1120142be265b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kapetancic, Erna. <emph render="italic">Targeted Delivery of Therapeutics for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0116</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_8caa8c95b058ed3e953c159100a87cad" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_de77111c797a5098b42f454423e59623" parent="aspace_8caa8c95b058ed3e953c159100a87cad" type="folder">2019-0116</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_782a6e3c6b82a68d4540640625ff7f1a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a cancer characterized by increased growth of granulocytic precursors. Currently, there are two therapeutic strategies to CML: imatinib mesylate, and a combination of arsenic trioxide and IFN-α. Imatinib is effective in controlling the chronic phase of the disease, but it is not curative since most of patients who discontinue the therapy relapse. The combination of arsenic trioxide and IFN-α is a novel treatment, which has been shown to reduce the clonogenic activity of CML cells ex vivo, and prolong the survival of primary CML mice. However, the major downside of this combinatorial treatment is its lack of specificity. The present study aims to overcome this lack of specificity by creating BSA-PLGA nanoparticles which encapsulate arsenic trioxide and IFN-α. To specifically target CML cells, Y-R-A-P-W-P-P sequence (CML cell-associated peptide) was conjugated to BSA surface.In vitro, these nanoparticles showed to be more effective in inducing apoptosis in CML cell lines than the current therapeutic strategies to CML. In vivo, the nanoparticles depleted all GFP-positive CML cells from CML mice blood.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_55ad8146be323d974cb44532414b6847" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lakhiani, Priyanka. <emph render="italic">Atf6-mediated Transcriptomic Signatures in Cellular Environments of Unfolded Protein Response Activation</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0068</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_2c3d7f6aad8a4fec17af332e2342e2de" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0cc22853440bc4acc8a580ccb67ae587" parent="aspace_2c3d7f6aad8a4fec17af332e2342e2de" type="folder">2019-0068</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3dbe4f99ba9c5bf73aa7039f116cbe8b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR); activating transcription factor 6 (Atf6) mediates one of three branches of this signaling pathway. UPR induction, however, can manifest heterogeneously across distinct conditions, generating variable molecular signatures and pathogenic phenotypes. This study aimed to elucidate the role of Atf6 in mediating UPR induction in zebrafish livers by characterizing Atf6-regulated transcriptomic signatures under distinct stressors. Putative Atf6 target genes were curated via a predicted consensus sequence and scraping transcription factor databases. UPR genes were similarly identified by compiling genes annotated for relevant Reactome and Gene Ontology terms. Curated gene lists were analyzed using RNAseq data from an atf6-overexpressing transgenic model of UPR induction; Atf6 was sufficient to cause differential expression of 23.6% of Atf6 target genes and 34.5% of UPR genes. RNAseq data from livers exposed to ethanol and arsenic was integrated to identify downstream genes inducible under environments of ER stress. Thus, by analyzing transcriptomic patterns and their biological relevance, we found that Atf6 mediates distinct forms of UPR activation through complex regulatory programs dependent on cellular environment.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_187126ebb5b2fc5e05d1bbea4411d36d" level="file"><did><unittitle>McHardie, Tayla. <emph render="italic">Optimisation of Palmitic Acid Production in Chloroidium sp.

Coral reef fish are exclusively ectotherms, so their physiological performance is directly tied to environmental temperatures and behavioral modulation is critical for ectotherms to regulate internal body temperatures. This study examined the effects of temperature and time of day on fish behavior in model fish from PAG, Lutjanus ehrenbergii (Blackspot snapper) and Scolopsis ghanam (Arabian monocle bream), at 18°C, 27°C, and 35.5°C between morning (07:15), noon (12:55), and evening (18:35). Specifically, five ecologically important behaviors: relative swimming speed, activity, exploration, sheltering, and sociability. Results showed that there were significant interactions between time of day and temperature on relative swimming speed, activity, and exploration, where each measure would increase as temperature increased and had peak values in the evening. Conversely, there were only interactions with temperature for S. ghanam, where sheltering was lowest at the thermal optimal 27°C. These behavioral modulations may be used to acclimate to extreme thermal stress within the region.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_7910e9acfe5019bd978205cb862a9b4f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nayfeh, Layanne. <emph render="italic">Characterizing Genetic And Epigenetic Modifications Of An Alga With Increased Lipid Accumulation Phenotype</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0074</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_3d9eb3fdc551e65440b686d050f8a0a5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_3881af4c056457a3cdd251a66cac377c" parent="aspace_3d9eb3fdc551e65440b686d050f8a0a5" type="folder">2019-0074</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ef366aae00c8f7513ec159c1186e3626"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Salehi-Ashtiani lab has been optimizing the lipid content of microalgae, specifically the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to efficiently produce compounds that can serve as substitutes for fossil fuels.

This interaction has been unsuccessfully modeled in mice due to a failure to adhere to common behavioral models of stress. Given the need to reliably investigate this relationship, the social defeat model of depression was used to determine how stress affects sleep architecture and sleep regulation, and how sleep can prevent or induce stress susceptibility. Combining EEG with transcriptomics of the medial prefrontal cortex, we found that mice susceptible to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress displayed fragmented NREM sleep with intrusions of wakefulness, which may be explained by differential expression of serotonergic receptors Htr1a/2a and afternoon blunting of Slc29a3 adenosine transport. Exposure to CSD increased the proportion of REM sleep at the beginning of the light cycle through more frequent but shorter bouts, which were associated with blunted morning expression of serotonergic signaling enzyme Prkcd and myelin function gene Mobp. Furthermore, manipulating sleep through TSD or REM deprivation (REMD) suggested that recovery sleep after REMD, but not TSD, may promote resilience to stress. Findings from this Capstone project therefore support the notion that susceptibility to stress and adaptive sleep responses mutually affect each other.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_4961750296834fa55b568cc817b3eea1" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Chemistry</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref67_no9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Karaba, Christopher TY. <emph render="italic">Design of an Experimental Setup for Direct observance of Containerless Processes in Acoustically Levitated Droplets</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0044</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_aad47959c6bce6b0600188672e2b4db9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_49fa96c8cc48e20c85786237ca380206" parent="aspace_aad47959c6bce6b0600188672e2b4db9" type="folder">2014-0044</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b8b2b07b7a5fd3fbdf7ef84c1e3ddab5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Chemistry <lb/>Abstract: Ultrasonic levitation can provide a unique tool to study processes of light emission such as triboluminescence, as the material can emit light under contactless acoustic impact.

In this work, three different proteins, green fluorescent protein (GFP), H1N1 influenza neurminidase, and H1N1 hemagglutinin, were included as guests and stabilized in crystals of -lactose monohydrate, maltose, and sucrose as crystalline matrices. The proteins were then analyzed with fluorescence microscopy and gel electrophoresis, before and after an hour of incubation at 60 °C, to determine whether denaturation had been retarded by the inclusion of the proteins in their host matrix.

The prototypic material was prepared by introducing azobenzene units into a polymer chain by condensation polymerization. The product thus obtained was combined with a hydrophilic polymer as a flexible matrix that provides elastic environment for facile isomerization of azobenzene moieties. In the result-ing hybrid films, cis-trans isomerization of the main polymer chain leads to contraction or expansion, thereby inducing re-versible macroscopic deformation of the film. The hydrophilic component is capable of exchange of water with the sur-roundings, causing periodic contractions and expansions that appear as rapid locomotion of the film over a moist surface. Moreover, the hybrid film also exhibits rapid mechanical response by bending of nearly 180o when exposed to UV light or when heated anisotropically. The new smart material could be utilized in a variety of actuating devices, including soft robot-ics, medical prosthetics, and in printing.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Smart polymers</subject><subject source="lcsh">Polymers</subject><subject source="lcsh">Condensation polymerization</subject><subject source="lcsh">Smart materials</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref397_1wg" level="file"><did><unittitle>El Khoury, Roberto Ibrahim. <emph render="italic">Enhancing Anion Binding Properties of a Zinc(II)-based Trefoil Knot</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0041</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_b4c5dc0df4a74af664b6c9f2d6f65ca2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_63120331b3290d248d7c1ef9c4ec89ac" parent="aspace_b4c5dc0df4a74af664b6c9f2d6f65ca2" type="folder">2015-0041</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_114bb7eaf2483d06e9d8149ee3dd9019"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Chemistry<lb/>Abstract: Recently, a stream of research into synthetic receptors has focused on recognizing oxoanions, particularly because of their environmental impacts. For example, phosphate, an oxoanion, builds up through the excessive use of fertilizers resulting in eutrophication of water bodies, while sulfate is used in the separation of nuclear wastes. Our group succeeded in simultaneously assembling three remarkable zinc-based complexes in water: the 2-catenane ([2]C), trefoil knot (TK), and Solomon link (SL). TK is interesting because of its cavity that can recognize a wide range of anions. We have now synthesized an analogous TK based on urea groups that preferentially recognize oxoanion pollutants such as phosphate and sulfate. Urea groups equip the cavity of TK with improved hydrogen bond donor capabilities, allowing it to interact better with oxoanions.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Metal templation</subject><subject source="local">Imine-bond formation</subject><subject source="lcsh">Anions</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ca296e20261a41ee7939a5f47e745f9c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ibrahim, Nadine. <emph render="italic">Computational Study of How β-loop Dynamics Regulates HCV Polymerase Activity in the Presence and Absence of a Thumb-site-II Inhibitor. </emph> </unittitle><unitid>2017-0032</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2017/2017">2017</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_568d7e12d7689b5c047e1db117a48b50">The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects around 150 million people globally, and chronic infection causes cirrhosis and cancer.

Despite the many recent advances, the dynamics of complex systems operating on long timescales still evades researchers due to the high computational demand. We developed a suite of programs to study biological processes across a range of timescales using short trajectories, providing a coarse-grained representation of relevant conformational states. This method was applied to two systems: (1) the rapid ion incorporation conformation in HIV Reverse Transcriptase; and, (2) the complex conformational transition of the Hammerhead-like ribozyme. Using only a one-dimensional reaction coordinate, ion incorporation was found to be a spontaneous and favorable process, with a free energy change of -3.37 kcal/mol. The structural switch mechanism of the Hammerhead-like ribozyme was also discovered in atomic detail, using both a low- and multi-dimensional configuration space definition. This higher-dimensional partitioning was shown to reliably describe the complexity of the system, but was found to be subject to poorer statistical convergence. Further development of this method may unlock new insights into the structure and dynamics of complex biological processes.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_07988d7f3808c0dec8b5ebc1162e37bf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dho, Yaereen. <emph render="italic">Synthesis of Triphenylphosphine-modified Gold Nanoparticles for an Effective Cytotoxic System to Cancer Cells</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0097</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_f6d2bcaed9183951189bdfe1505a16ee" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_9425f1bbe55d524880f35aa324c82da8" parent="aspace_f6d2bcaed9183951189bdfe1505a16ee" type="folder">2018-0097</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c0a136d2ca340dd68214379112221267"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We developed a green and innovative synthetic route for gold nanoparticles, surface coated with therapeutic agent triphenylphosphine (TPP) and stabilized with Pluronic F-108 polymer (F-108@TPP-AuNPs) for an effective cytotoxic system to cancer cells.

One synergistic pathway is through biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)—a phytohormone—by diatom-associated bacteria from diatom-secreted tryptophan that triggers nutrient exchanges between both taxa. The role of other phytohormones in diatom-bacteria interactions remains largely unknown. Here, several strains of bacteria associated with the cosmopolitan bloom-forming diatom Asterionellopsis glacialis were isolated and cultivated to establish the roles phytohormones play in diatom physiology. IAA alone did not enhance the growth of A. glacialis, but did so in combination with two other phytohormones, gibberellic acid and kinetin. Analyzing the metabolomes of F5, F10, and F28 using UHPLC-Q-ToF-MS showed that out of 74 known phytohormones, auxins, jasmonates, and a cytokinin were produced by all associated bacteria, with higher auxin production in F5 and higher jasmonate production in F10 and F28. These results suggest that a unique combination of hormones may enhance the diatom growth and that, in a complex microbiome, multiple phytohormone production by one or more bacteria, could cooperatively regulate or initiate diatom growth.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4edf5eec191785c01235f952d13012f6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gambrill, Yumi. <emph render="italic">Purification and structural elucidation of a thiazole-based molecule from Cleome rupicola fruits exhibiting antioxidant and potential anticataract activity</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0088</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_15e79b25a6b9045eaf42df6566ebed77" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0dad7e07240b4816f453fee119804905" parent="aspace_15e79b25a6b9045eaf42df6566ebed77" type="folder">2018-0088</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_27c98c261fc3a0c28d934cded768d7f7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p><emph render="italic">No Abstract</emph></p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0b02510e6203e546081b69d016c2710e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Henning, Anna. <emph render="italic">Optimising Photolabile Protecting Groups for Incorporation into Biological Probes</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0083</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_cf3d6617749b05311fb5d6a5ca7a9e64" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_d7f270d8016c1ea6280a27024260fb93" parent="aspace_cf3d6617749b05311fb5d6a5ca7a9e64" type="folder">2018-0083</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4a44f1b3b7813f9d7eaeac8b9bf9f323"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Understanding physiological processes is vital for scientific advancement in many areas, from disease control to technological developments. While much progress has been made, particularly with the help of bioimaging techniques, a full knowledge of human physiology remains distant. To narrow the gap in knowledge, there is a need to develop more biological probes for studying the dynamic nature of physiological processes. Using light-dependent probes is effective as they provide tight control of the timing and location of events. In this category, photolabile protecting groups (PPGs) are of particular interest because of their simplicity of use. PPGs activated through the simultaneous absorption of two photons are especially useful for investigations in whole animals. However, the lack of PPGs activated by absorption of two photons is an impediment to their use. This project aims to optimise the 8-cyano-7-hydroxyquinolinyl PPG for higher sensitivity to two-photon absorption.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c36a49d680480cd6b4ea9546dd247b30" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jahovic, Ilma.  <emph render="italic">Rapid and Efficient Removal of Perfluorooctanoic Acid from Water with Fluorine-Rich Calixarene-Based Porous Polymers</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0091</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_1d1b4740b5bfa068d81cfff24082213f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_c40fbacece6e6224cce1bf63c77df8f9" parent="aspace_1d1b4740b5bfa068d81cfff24082213f" type="folder">2018-0091</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_52ab1984d9a52de7d969565d10fc5dae"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Because of its non-biodegradable nature and persistence in the environment, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) accumulates in water resources and poses serious environmental issues in many parts of the world.

Here, we present the development of two fluorine-rich calix[4]arene-based porous polymers, FCX4-P and FCX4-BP, and demonstrate their potential utility for the removal of PFOA from water. FCX4-P removes ~99% of PFOA at environmentally relevant concentrations with higher affinity than the commercial activated carbon and with comparable kinetics.

The MEL-28 protein in C. elegans (ELYS in vertebrates) is a NUP with numerous essential cell cycle functions that are conserved in humans, including a role in DNA replication licensing. Zebrafish Elys mutants are highly sensitized to treatment with DNA replication inhibitors such as Cisplatin, suggesting that MEL-28 could be used as a cancer therapy target. To test this hypothesis, we characterized a C. elegans mel-28 thermosensitive mutant strain and screened the Spectrum Collection small molecule library to identify chemicals that cause enhancement in a mel-28 sensitized background. We identified seven compounds that specifically enhance mel-28, some of which are known to affect microtubules. We then tested whether the selected compounds act in a synergistic way with Cisplatin in the mel-28(ts) and wildtype genetic backgrounds and observed synergism with three compounds specifically in the mel-28(ts) strain. Interestingly, one of them, Mitotane, is already used in combinatorial drug therapy with Cisplatin in patients with adrenal carcinoma, thus providing proof of concept for our experimental approach. Our results confirm MEL-28/ELYS as a candidate chemotherapy drug target, establish C. elegans mel-28 as a model for identifying new cancer drugs, and demonstrate that known chemicals could potentially be repurposed for combinatorial chemotherapy. Finally, we identified compounds not previously described to affect wild-type worms that could provide leads for new broad-spectrum anthelmintics.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_3fb382fb544ea2d596a5675b282df972" level="file"><did><unittitle>Boutros, Sandra Emad. <emph render="italic">Crown-ether Calix[4]arene Porous Organic Polymer for Lithium Enrichment</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0078</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_88026455ab22940621c8128af087afac" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5212173e4f0bdd017d6b637f9bc15a6a" parent="aspace_88026455ab22940621c8128af087afac" type="folder">2019-0078</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3a90587a767481239d3b2134c5a1d557"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Because of the premature depletion of lithium resources due to the extensive battery production, extracting it from various and uncommon resources is a vital need to maintain a growing industry of electric devices and vehicles.

Scale inhibitors, chemical inhibitors which can prevent the formation of asphaltene deposits in oil wells and pipelines, are of particular interest. The scale inhibitors currently in use have low efficacy and several shortcomings, which increases the need to extend research into novel chemicals. In this study, we test various aromatic inhibitors with different functional moieties. Fluorescence studies and Hill analysis demonstrated that inhibitors X3 and Y3, which were surfactant-like with strongly acidic and electron-withdrawing moieties, showed the lowest dissociation constants (Kd) over time and across different sources of asphaltenes. These inhibitors showed the highest affinity to different types of asphaltene molecules and are, therefore, most likely to form complexes with asphaltenes, preventing them from further aggregating. Additionally, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) analysis revealed that inhibitor X3 was able to remove 70% of the adsorbed mass of asphaltenes from carbon steel, which mimics actual surfaces in oil wells and pipelines. The results indicate that aromatic inhibitors with acidic and electron-withdrawing moieties are good scale inhibitor candidates; they can be effective in interacting with asphaltenes and potentially preventing them from aggregating further.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_7b5c4cf098c5eff5ee57ee5ca0c29e05" level="file"><did><unittitle>Knyazeva, Anastassiya. <emph render="italic">Investigation of relationship between material properties and self-healing in crystals of boronic esters and disulfides</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0113</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_9babe19424865df0b1b0063a0c3bb1f3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_6ba18e3ba2a1f4f9971649eb8a671f12" parent="aspace_9babe19424865df0b1b0063a0c3bb1f3" type="folder">2019-0113</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0f186218ff169805f30c1c75521dd3f0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Degradation and loss of integrity are among the biggest shortcomings of materials that are exposed to mechanical impact.

This paper proposes the use of a built-in browser application that actively collects user data and renders it to create a privacy feedback profile to the user. The feedback page focuses on informing users that third parties can monitor their data, along with making inferences on the user so they're aware of how telling their data can be. In a weeklong study, users of the application showed increased levels of concern and awareness for their digital privacy. These results encourage the use of such applications as viable ways of educating individuals and encouraging safer online browsing habits.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Information technology</subject><subject source="lcsh">Internet</subject><subject source="lcsh">Data mining</subject><subject source="lcsh">Privacy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref383_77c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Grishin, Oleg. <emph render="italic">Displayer.

Displayer focuses on proposing and implementing an easy-to-use system that provides a front-end interface to create and schedule tasks that include but are not limited to displaying pictures, videos and slideshows. While many of such public screens focus on simply displaying information, the proposed system also allows for creating more interactive tasks, e.g. a video-portal between two displays. The project discusses a working implementation of such a system, while also outlining possible future extensions, e.g. connecting systems like the Microsoft Kinect to allow the creation of more complex tasks, such as signing up for events by showing a student ID. While the working implementation performs a variety of those simple tasks, the system's back-end is built around the idea of allowing future (possibly user-written) extensions.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Computer systems</subject><subject source="lcsh">Information display systems</subject><subject source="lcsh">Calendars</subject><subject source="lcsh">Computers</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref414_63l" level="file"><did><unittitle>Shin, Jiwon. <emph render="italic">Reaching Out to You (in my own ways).</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0039</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_51ee02802cafceabf23439448e0778cc">Reaching Out to You (in my own ways) is a multimedia art project comprised of three pieces of artwork that individually combine analog and digital ways of communication in order to prompt the viewers to think about how the level of engagement changes according to different ways of communication.

This is due to the fact thatPDFs do not conform to any conventions in terms of document structure and that PDF generators tend to use different rules for assembling the documents. A solution that can allow users to retrieve structured information from a document in a form that is easily manipulated can have a noticeable positive impact for professionals across a broad spectrum of industries.The framework put forward in this paper,Texture, uses diverse heuristic techniques in order to extract structural elements (lists, titles, headers and footers, paragraphs, figures and tables) fromPDFs. They are assigned different weights that lead to robust and accurate extractors.Texture also introduces a domain specific language that allows users to query documents using natural language.We demonstrate that Texture has potential to perform as well as the manual labeling process while being much easier to use than any labor crowdsourcing platform. Texture is also cheaper, quicker, and more scalable than hiring crowd workers to handle the same extraction tasks.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_42b6c41ce03d205cc07c8071cd472f5e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ahmad, Muaz; Dana Abu Ali, Hayat Al Hassan, Ming Hu, Paula Dozsa. <emph render="italic">Time-offset Interaction Application</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0101</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_9547230e5170e0301f451e99458726d4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_23a58c99d4b27a18d7da4fdf86e634ce" parent="aspace_9547230e5170e0301f451e99458726d4" type="folder">2018-0101</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b866d53e02578e59b1789bbe3c225d6d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper presents a bilingual (Arabic-English) interactive human avatar dialogue system.

Public figures, news channels, and sports event with followers numbered in millions receive up to a million views in their livestreams and the number is  growing. The current broadcasting infrastructures rely on large and expensive networks of media servers and edge caches that are distributed around the globe to maintain network efficiency, quality, and reliability. In this paper, we present Esfera, a light-weight, scalable, peer-to-peer live video broadcasting infrastructure  that utilizes the potentials of WebRTC, a set of APIs that allows ultra-low latency browser-to-browser communication without external plugins. Commercial platforms such as Facebook Messenger, and Google Hangouts have successfully tested and deployed their VoIP services on WebRTC, and broadcasting is the next  milestone in the success of WebRTC. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the design and implementation of Esfera and present an evaluation of its performance. Finally, we discuss the limitations and future challenges that are posed by peer-to-peer live broadcasting using WebRTC.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_eb8aeb703997e626ac18808ed5fce3b9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hopkins, Brooke. <emph render="italic">Insulin Pump Vulnerabilities and Design for Secure Device Communication</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0073</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_7e5fc85e685750f9d9ba99ad06bf8ffa" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_a7e01a68ec257453bcbae5545e1e6167" parent="aspace_7e5fc85e685750f9d9ba99ad06bf8ffa" type="folder">2018-0073</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_98e6b29a3d4cb224c29984efb185de82"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Advanced health technology promises to bring considerable advances to patient care. However, there are great security risks which can have disastrous health consequences. Several studies show that implantable medical devices (IMDs) have vulnerabilities enabling man in the middle attacks that could disclose patient data or even inflict patient harm. Insulin delivery systems, which are commonly used IMDs, are vulnerable for this reason. All communication between the continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and the insulin pump is unencrypted, and protective PINs are passed in plain text. While there is existing research that documents this vulnerability and proposes solutions, these provide only suggestions for device modification that could be implemented by the manufacturer in future models. In this paper, we propose a design for a fully backwards compatible external device that ensures authenticity and integrity of communication between the CGM and the insulin pump. The design employs friendly jamming techniques to provide access control by jamming unauthenticated communication.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_50e1874a6579fc1b7e381ba95353f04b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jensen, Frederik. <emph render="italic">On Problems Related to Epsilon-Nets</emph>

We also obtain tight bounds for all k-sided objects in the dual setting for nets of size 1, and a tight bound of 2/3 for nets of size 2 with respect to halfspaces. We show the two following elegant results: Given a set of points and a set of disks in the plane, if every three disks intersect in a common

By this we mean that if an object s in S contains more than a fraction epsilon of the points in P, then the object must also contain one or more of the points in the epsilon-net. In this capstone paper, we explore a variety of problems related to epsilon-nets. We improve the bounds on epsilon for disks and half-spaces when the epsilon-net contains 2 points. We also improve the bounds for disks and half-spaces for dual epsilon-nets. There are two additional proofs we provide related to hitting sets. We prove that if every three points is contained in a half-plane, then two half-planes must cover all points. We also prove that if every three disks intersect at a point, then two points hit all disks.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1e5604856629a9bd65dae788b6d4a1d1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chen, Wei Peter; Shehroze Khan, Jihyun Kim, Tarik Zulfikarpasic. <emph render="italic">Qutr: A Cross-lingual Messenger with Keyword Searchable Phrases for the Travel Domain</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0089</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_711b85dcfbfde6daadf000cd58163e4b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ba84205d054da926e1671e239a6f4601" parent="aspace_711b85dcfbfde6daadf000cd58163e4b" type="folder">2018-0089</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9d7cf2a671cdd236b80fbb57fdad6c2e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We present Qutr (Query Translator), a smart cross-lingual communication application for the travel domain.

The main problem in the domain is that classification requires uniform data with accurate labels, but online collected image datasets can not provide pose, illumination or resolution invariance and the assigned labels have a high error rate. We surveyed the current state-of-the-art methods in generating face representations from online datasets, and tested them with noise resistant machine learning architectures. We applied the findings on a dataset of 30 million images to aid research at Princeton University on racial discrimination in career progression in corporate structures. Our final architecture: From the input images we generate low level face representations using the Openface neural network to overcome the invariance in our dataset. These representations are then fed into a base neural network which has a denoising layer attached to it that attempts to correct the error in the labels. Our approach reached 0.79 f1-score on the FERET dataset. The novelty of the project is two-fold: it adds to our understanding of machine learning under noisy conditions, and proposes a computationally efficient approach to classify millions of faces.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0df2aa5057c5ed229900cda676d156df" level="file"><did><unittitle> Mirza, Muhammad Shujaat. <emph render="italic">Reimagining Privacy in Online Social Networks</emph>

While the privacy of current postings has been the subject of multiple research groups, the re-evaluation of the privacy settings for these posts down the line is a new area of interest for people. In regard to recent episodes such as the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, discussions have revolved around the value we associate with the old postings. Whereas different platforms try to offer options to have some control over the accessibility of our information, their effectiveness relies on the extent to which users understand those options. Through this study, we aim to explore the relation between user's perception of their profile privacy settings and their actual settings. Our study, based on the participant pool of 91, reports that there is a significant mismatch between the actual exposure to the posts versus the user's perception of the privacy settings. We also investigate the impact old postings can have on friend circle expansion. The findings show how the aged information, relevant or irrelevant, finds a way to influence the user's behavior in the current context.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9eb450ed2bba2cde094e153afe472c46" level="file"><did><unittitle>Moore, Megan. <emph render="italic">Detection and Analysis of Devices Used to Censor Networks</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0060</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_1704df4b53595d8f512ef114e9cfbe6f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ecf29738140c198da9e1bedd56faced9" parent="aspace_1704df4b53595d8f512ef114e9cfbe6f" type="folder">2018-0060</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_68607ba961685d85fc7a9c7d0a25dca8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This capstone sought to better understand the state of censorship in the world today.

Open PWLANs are now a standard part of the global Internet infrastructure and are becoming a standard in-flight amenity on many commercial airplanes. Public networks, including in-flight Wi-Fi hotspots, are typically implemented as open wireless hotspots with user authentication and connection control implemented via redirection of HTTP(S) traffic from unrecognized devices to a captive portal. In this paper, we describe an exploit in which captive portal networks are exposed to authentication bypassing by unauthorized, selfish clients. We then describe a spoofing detection and mitigation suite designed to protect PWLANs against this class of spoofing attacks. In the context of in-flight wireless networks, captive portal circumvention by unauthorized users is especially critical given the high latency, low bandwidth physical layer that this type of network relies upon. The ultimate goal of this paper is to outline the construction of a comprehensive spoofing attack defense mechanism.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_74b21e7e522372c1ade9862907caae9c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sharma, Prashant. <emph render="italic">Machine Learning technique for extraction of phase for the Indian monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO)</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0078</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_2ec1fc23944e72e9b1c1c2057d5b8930" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_833a6b5b17f5b4ba32483bebe1e68e7c" parent="aspace_2ec1fc23944e72e9b1c1c2057d5b8930" type="folder">2018-0078</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_24f5ab6db4b93096409015112fa8bc03"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Climate scientists use methods of decomposition of Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) signal obtained through satellite imagery in terms of orthogonal basis functions which are determined from the data and find both time series and spatial patterns to construct Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillation (MISO) phases.

Test data is also useful for demonstrating product features or for creating educational material. Since real data may be confidential or difficult to obtain and wrangle, engineers and researchers rely on synthetic data generators. Existing data generators may be platform or programming language specific, difficult to use, and may often generate unrealistic-looking data because they do not allow users to adequately customize inputs and generated data. We present Synner, a data generation tool which focuses primarily on usability. Synner allows users to sketch custom input data distributions and specify relationships or dependencies between fields. In the spreadsheet interface, users can select from a various data types, domains and functions and see a preview of records. Since ultimately data is generated probabilistically, it is imperative to communicate this uncertainty in probabilistic data generation to users. We perform a user study to determine visualization techniques to suitably communicate probabilistic uncertainty. We allow users to enter examples of data and generate data that matches these examples by inferring the type, distribution and proportion of the examples provided by the user.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f6281b39297fa7d6e566b731a8b39369" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ahmed, David. <emph render="italic">Combining Keystroke and Mouse Dynamics for Stronger and More Usable Authentication</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0075</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_ad3eda17fe5782aeadfc1852e89db1dd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_3700d89e817ba2302372ede2086effd5" parent="aspace_ad3eda17fe5782aeadfc1852e89db1dd" type="folder">2019-0075</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e57ffefe48998f87fd241e8ae12cb99b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Traditional approaches to strengthening authentication systems come in the form such as Multi-Factor authentication (MFA) schemes, One-Time-Passwords (OTP), new password policies, etc. Even though these measures tend to improve authentication methods in theory, they come at a huge cost in terms of usability and practical security. This project investigates and proposes a combined implementation of keystroke and mouse dynamics for increasing the usability of current authentication schemes by making authentication systems more intelligent and user-centric. Consequently, instead of blindly posing challenges to authenticators, our approach allows for the authentication system to make real-time decisions as to if there is a necessity for new challenges in the form of MFA or other forms of traditional approaches.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ccb65c667369487d8eafaa4e47138f1e" level="file"><did><unittitle> Al Dhaheri, Ali Saif Gharib Salem. <emph render="italic">Bulbul: An Online Application for Testing Arabic Dialect Knowledge</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0073</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_73af08f405b30680ae3d5415c4ca4399" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_679e946a9198667cf3aa2de8dbbdde6b" parent="aspace_73af08f405b30680ae3d5415c4ca4399" type="folder">2019-0073</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b9b3489c2568d74c554a03cfb9a7e320"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>My project aims to educate native Arabic speakers as well as advanced non-native Arabic speakers on some of the basics of the numerous Arabic dialects through the use of a web application.

These recommendations are derived from the set of similar patients and a patient's most recent test results. Currently, our system is trained on data collected from ICU patients admitted for pneumonia. In the future, it can be extended to accommodate a variety of diseases. We compared our system against a random sampling of actions.

Nearly half the world's languages are gender-dependent, yet current machine translation systems do not indicate the gender of the characters that appear in the translated phrases. This is largely due to the fact that they are built on gender ambiguous human-generated data which reflect social biases, as well as the fact that these systems are designed to give one output. Providing the system with access to user preferences is the ideal seamless solution; but giving the user clear alternatives to select from is a good alternative. We propose an approach to designing a gender-aware machine translation system through gender identification and gender translation that can be used together with any NLP application that generates text interfacing with users. We focus on English-Arabic sentence pairs in the first-person where the gender identity needs to be specified. We develop a first-of-its-kind gender-labeled corpus for training and evaluating first-person gender identification and gender translation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5a993997c039027a20079d1c69b17d25" level="file"><did><unittitle>Diugan, Raluca-Georgia, Guyu Fan, and Xin Tong. <emph render="italic">Timbre: A Decentralized Forum with Blockchain-based Distributed Data Store</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0125</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_99e334bd911cad82e128e958cc037b28" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5d94988aad6b8de151811d6fb0ef40f8" parent="aspace_99e334bd911cad82e128e958cc037b28" type="folder">2019-0125</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5741a5b4d38d74e111de816706429ce8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Much of the public discourse today takes place online on social media platforms.

In response to this issue, we design and implement Timbre, a Blockchain-based distributed data storage system for decentralized online forums. In Timbre, forum content is distributed to different nodes, and a blockchain that records the complete history of user data storage and transactions for data retrieval is propagated across the peer-to-peer (P2P) network.

Even with a simple methodology for each individual system, utilizing a hybrid approach establishes new state-of-the-art results on two domain-specific hypernym discovery tasks and outperforms all non-hybrid approaches in a general hypernym discovery task.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2d599010f5680b202ab5a2a9ec20c8fc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nwadike, Munachiso. <emph render="italic">SateNet: Pixel-Level Segmentation of Satellite Images</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0110</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_4dbe193f34654930f4a99b7b61fc68df" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_e8bf28581e5c418223ee4de20b3166d5" parent="aspace_4dbe193f34654930f4a99b7b61fc68df" type="folder">2019-0110</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_946e45b377698d38cb32577ab1e831eb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Recent work in semantic segmentation has shown the effectiveness of context encoding in allowing neural networks to model spatial context for better performance. We set out to apply this development to the field of remote sensing. Our focus is to develop a new approach for semantic segmentation of Very High Resolution (VHR) images. This class of aerial images is often difficult to attain high quality semantic labels for, given the distinct challenges that come with images that have been remotely sensed via satellite or other aerial mechanisms. We make use of a lightweight architecture of convolutional neural networks, combined with context encoding to attain strong performance on the Vaihingen 2D semantic labeling competition. Our approach attains a competitive overall accuracy, as well as a strong classwise performance.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4dd99fdb3c7e5f2d70c90965299288e1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Olesen, Emil Goldsmith. <emph render="italic">GoodLiving: An Amenity- and Location-sensitive Cross-city Property Search Tool</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0088</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_ae18b8f5f63726f30fa57ee902f9d9c3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_e809bf201b03146c5d349eb49c00fa0d" parent="aspace_ae18b8f5f63726f30fa57ee902f9d9c3" type="folder">2019-0088</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_590b6375cad7430124622ad190e00739"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>GoodLiving (https://goodliving-beta.herokuapp.com/) is a system that supports new features for property search. GoodLiving specifically provides users the ability to find properties near places that they would like to visit (e.g. specific tourist destinations) or utilize (e.g. specific ethnic restaurants) and far from places they want to avoid (e.g. train stations). We built GoodLiving focusing both on creating an easy to use, simple and intuitive user experience, and on offering as many searchable attributes as  possible. We then conducted a preliminary pilot user test, which despite being affected by imperfections in the prototype, showed great promise for GoodLiving and our proposed features (see complete data and scripts here), leading us to strongly  recommend further work being done on developing GoodLiving and generally good location-based search parameters for property search. GoodLiving is open source (https://github.com/emilgoldsmith/GoodLiving) to allow further development.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_26257fe8f2ba753f3872f43929fb5a0e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rodriguez, Arantza. <emph render="italic">Emerge: a content creation and distribution application</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0083</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_2b35a2b932e33b112ee514f8a7377e03" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_76d22cfda10887849ae2e3ff4039a9f7" parent="aspace_2b35a2b932e33b112ee514f8a7377e03" type="folder">2019-0083</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_60d246b937077b44c7fe94c1c760cf28"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The increased development and use of smartphone technology are contributing greatly to social empowerment and economic growth in emerging countries. However, despite this, smartphone users are still facing major challenges. Access to the internet in these regions suffers from slow load times, poor performances, and limited opportunities dedicated to local content creation and diffusion. Therefore, there is no chance for relevant information to be easily distributed. For my computer Science capstone project, I have developed an Android mobile application, known as EMERGE, to enable the diffusion of locally produced content in emerging countries. It has a series of templates that members can use to efficiently publish content in the form of articles. These articles are organized into several categories that help members easily find information that is most relevant to their interests. The application has been tested in three communities in Central Mexico: Juriquilla, La Barreta, and Colon. Through behavior analysis and a feedback survey, data has been gathered, processed, and presented in this paper. We believe that the results have been generally positive with people praising the features of EMERGE. Nonetheless, there have been several suggestions to improve the application, which will be implemented in the near future.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9f3a224da827fcb363d53154cf5699c8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Seo, Simon. <emph render="italic">Lifting Squares to Half-spaces: a Specifi c Case of Lifting Pseudo-disks</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0097</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_11728e6e9f6efe089bf01fa21be3df1a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_2053a4eaa0391c6a35c24e3dbf2bbc4f" parent="aspace_11728e6e9f6efe089bf01fa21be3df1a" type="folder">2019-0097</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b15602f225876619542dd30cefd09cda"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A half-space in R3 is either of the two parts separated by a plane.

As a response to this, online Social Networks (OSNs) like Instagram and Snapchat have introduced features that  allows users content to be deleted after a predetermined amount of time. However, this system is inflexible as it only provides with one option for the amount of time a users content will be available online (24 hours). Other time-based revocation protocols have been proposed such as Neuralyzer which introduces the concept of flexible expiration times in which data is deleted based on different heuristics with one of them being drop of interest. None of these models account for the fact that users have different audiences in mind when they post content online which can range from close friends and family to the general public depending on the occasion. The aim of this capstone project is to create a time-based revocation model based on the drop of interest heuristic presented by Neuralyzer but that is also aware of the intended audience of the users content.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_121455a123f3f3e79ab94db0ae0003cb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Watanabe, Shunya. <emph render="italic">Supervised Segmentation of Electronic Dance Music </emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0115</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_eb163541572f49dec1f9eaaea5b63864" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_b181b3bf6df5347416ce88fa4beb0ae9" parent="aspace_eb163541572f49dec1f9eaaea5b63864" type="folder">2019-0115</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2b387d9b66bc3d3a4d48213f46b0e2fd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this research, I provide a case study for the segmentation of Electronic Dance Music. First, the chroma feature is employed to obtain the harmonic content of a song. The information gained from the chroma feature is then used to construct the self-similarity matrix. Using the self-similarity matrix, the novelty curve is calculated. The data consist of fifty arbitrary chosen songs in the genres of Electronic Danice Music, including Big Room and Future House. For the sake of simplicity, all the songs have the beats per minute (bpm) of 128. The performance of the algorithm is determined by calculating its F1 score, and the implications of the research are discussed in the paper. Utilizing the algorithm, I created an interface for the DJs to efficiently make a playlist for their performance. The interface provides recommendations for the next song to play and when to mix. The recommendations are based on its bpm, energy level, and segment types. I believe that this will change the workflow of making the playlists for the DJs.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_89e823848e32edde5c056327d26c9b09" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Mathematics</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref52_jup" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chien, Ruey-Ting. <emph render="italic">On The Shape of The Numerical Range for Some Tridiagonal Matrices</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0055</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_8a338cc3a34978c3e4973ce23c1462b6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_000d9e81b072adb8a8410d592c12f9f2" parent="aspace_8a338cc3a34978c3e4973ce23c1462b6" type="folder">2014-0055</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0a8c9d452df53101c0ddffa373822b40"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Mathematics, Physics<lb/>Abstract: In this paper, we provided several new proofs of some known theorems regarding the condition of ellipticity for tridiagonal matrices with n = 3 and n = 4.

So, the maximal numerical range of a matrix is always a subset of the numerical range of that matrix. We establish conditions under which the maximal numerical range has a non-empty intersection with the boundary of the numerical range, in particular when they coincide. We also describe the maximal numerical range explicitly for matrices unitarily similar to direct sums of 2-by-2 blocks, and provide some insight into the behavior of the maximal numerical range when L has codimension one.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_a6faa2bb904fd17bb5cd3a71689f75e9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Stoica, Andrei. <emph render="italic">Determination of RNA structures using SAXS data</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0061</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_ab424518ca2e1098a7a10ecb8a21ec6e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_7dd98ad3de6a915c37a023fd86c27cb6" parent="aspace_ab424518ca2e1098a7a10ecb8a21ec6e" type="folder">2018-0061</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2b714ec6f004f742ba05c8c8c834f754"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This project extends a computational method to determine the structure of proteins using small-angle X-ray scattering data and applies it to determining the structure of nucleic acids in explicit solvent.

This paper focuses on lattice models, placing a particular emphasis on the Ising Model and the Discrete Gaussian Free Field (DGFF). Exploiting certain formal similarities between these two models, we extrapolate the random current representation, a geometric representation of the ferromagnetic Ising Model, to the DGFF in an effort to provide a different perspective on the latter model, one that can potentially be useful to compute quantities of interest. Note that a random current representation similar to that for the Ising model and that developed in our paper was derived for a Markov Field by Camia and Lis (2016).</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b6ce0317021efaf83f3539518ba07365" level="file"><did><unittitle>Badowska, Aleksandra. <emph render="italic">Numerical Range and Product Numerical Range - Ratio of the Volumes</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0104</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_27324acfc328c8407311c298026a9d6e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_3fc46338ad73ec450fcebe6d4b148857" parent="aspace_27324acfc328c8407311c298026a9d6e" type="folder">2019-0104</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b99d757891ef0a89b91cce0815967368"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We examine the numerical range $W(A)$ and its modification - the product numerical range $W^\otimes(A)$ - of a square matrix $A$ defined in an inner product space with a tensor product structure.

This project aims to address this gap in scientific knowledge and provide insight about the ability of a forest to recover after a selective cut by modeling the dynamical system of the coexistence between trees and vines subject to disturbances. We suggest that depending on the shape of the basin boundary, a selective cut can shift the system from the healthy to the unhealthy basin of attraction. This would mean that with time, the forest does not recover to its initial healthy state but falls into a long-lasting degraded state implying that selective cutting can have a long-term negative impact on the forest ecosystem.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6358b207e3e5808b8f51ecf046498173" level="file"><did><unittitle>Zhu, Lin. <emph render="italic">Simulation of sinking spheroidal phytoplanktons</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0111</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_6f30315284a0fae6f00a1c99cbd77418" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_55f0bca27c2371a7e6ec97259e36e163" parent="aspace_6f30315284a0fae6f00a1c99cbd77418" type="folder">2019-0111</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f15a660060c6a04c89304eb2e128e41a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We speculate that the sinking fraction of plankton cells can vary with respect to their shapes.

Abstract: HD189733b is one of the most extensively studied exoplanets to date. The Jupiter sized gas giant orbits close to its host star with a two day period, and due to tidal locking, one side is constantly and heavily irradiated. Transmission spectra and secondary eclipse observations of HD189733b suggest that mineral dust clouds are prominent in the upper atmosphere. Cloud formation and dust opacities, however, are generally omitted from global circulation models. We present radial dust opacity profiles of HD189733b based on a 3D radiative-hydrodynamical simulation and a kinetic cloud formation model specifically tuned for the planet. We find that (1) optical properties of clouds are dominated by iron condensates on the dayside and by silicates on the nightside; (2) cloud formation is restricted to low pressures in the atmosphere; and (3) cloud structure varies significantly with longitude and wavelength. The observed trends might be valid for other hot Jupiters as well, and, if incorporated into general circulation models, could lead to improved understanding of the atmospheric circulation of extrasolar planets.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Opacity (Optics)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Clouds</subject><subject source="local">HD189733b</subject><subject source="local">Hot Jupiters</subject><subject source="lcsh">Jupiter (Planet)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref375_k9b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dahal, Sumit. <emph render="italic">Characterization of Muon Events in XENON100 Dark Matter Detector</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0042</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_bd4672f51591e165c2314a4843cce3af" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5033dc8474849e960c032d2fd164b49a" parent="aspace_bd4672f51591e165c2314a4843cce3af" type="folder">2015-0042</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5e73e7f6b69c67d284cf311b604d9205"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Physics, Mathematics<lb/>Abstract: The XENON100 dark matter experiment is designed to detect xenon nuclear recoils resulting from the scattering of dark matter Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).

Just as our Solar System's evolution was affected by the presence of a large long orbital period planet, Jupiter, these exoplanets may therefore serve as an indicator of a complex planetary system like our own. Using the archival Kepler data, a publically available dataset generated by the NASA Kepler space observatory, we conduct a search for potential novel Jupiter-Analog exoplanets.

Previous detectors used to study TGFs were limited by their slow response times and therefore more observations are needed to construct a model to describe this phenomena. The proposed detector is based on Cerium(III) Bromide crystals coupled to a compact (Hamamatsu R11265U-100) photomultiplier tube. This instrument will have a faster time response, high resolution (3.5% at 661 keV) and a high density. Given the limited power consumption on a Cubesat (2-6W), the aim is to develop a low cost detector with extremely low power requirements and a response time of less than 100 ns that can be standardized to fit within 1U of a CubeSat. This describes the characteristics of the prototype unit detector such as linearity, voltage gain, and the gain as a function of temperature for the crystal and PMT.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_50b40dd179f5db30e619bb447afec797" level="file"><did><unittitle>D'Alterio, Kristopher. <emph render="italic">Automatization of Faint NEO Follow-Up</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0050</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_3ff3ed4d7af227b57d1014137ef7f0da" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_d682905b5557612fe6e0737239ba9288" parent="aspace_3ff3ed4d7af227b57d1014137ef7f0da" type="folder">2018-0050</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e13bb7d483de882ed16f9797dab562ed"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this paper we describe a method to improve the follow up process for near earth objects (NEOs), especially for faint and fast moving NEOs. Current follow up procedures typically use imaging with telescope in sidereal rotation and as a consequence the image of the moving NEO is a linear track instead of a point source. This makes it difficult to recover faint or fast moving sources. We propose a new follow up method where the telescope tracks the NEO rather than tracking with sidereal motion, and therefore focuses the image onto a smaller number of pixels. In order to explore the effectiveness of such a method, we have created simulated images which accurately depict the images that would be found if this method were applied, and determined the recovery rate of NEOs for such simulated images under varying conditions. We have also identified future work that should be done in order to improve these recovery rates, and laid out a framework for making a complete statistical evaluation of the method, which would give a description of the recovery rate of the method as a function of the magnitude and velocity of an NEO.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_38127c8ab0fc88693add2f0a27a47544" level="file"><did><unittitle>Stoychev, Boyan. <emph render="italic">Constraining nature of dark matter with high redshift galaxies</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0056</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_8df043ddb4cb72dc16f9bbb1fdcb3b64" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_495800a9319e928ce91e6c1a3fef4b0f" parent="aspace_8df043ddb4cb72dc16f9bbb1fdcb3b64" type="folder">2018-0056</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b4614ad1129e54515016b95b3997614f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models provide a promising alternative cosmological scenario to the standard Λ Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. Numerous studies have employed cosmological numerical simulations to constrain the allowed mass of WDM particles based on low-redshift observational data. When restricted to  this range, viable WDM models produce indistinguishable predictions at low redshift that are in agreement with CDM. In this work, galaxy formation at z = 6-10 was studied in the framework of the NIHAO project, comparing 3keV WDM to CDM. Halo mass functions were calculated from dark-matter-only simulations of the  CDM and WDM scenarios, and fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Simulations of galaxy formation using hydrodynamics were used to construct stellar mass - halo mass relations, which were then fitted with power laws. Those simulations were also used to calculate the fraction of galaxies that do not form stars as a function of halo mass. Finally, the above calculations were used to construct stellar mass functions for the two models at redshift 6-10, with the hope that the James Webb Space Telescope may be able to discriminate between the two models after its launch in 2020.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d9eacd1a70843ed4659f182662a64f9f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Torres, Rodrigo. <emph render="italic">Deployment of a Multidetector X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0059</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_2cdc3d874f9b48a27c97e68525e60fd7" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_645b6f8080896bef96641fbe3c76a827" parent="aspace_2cdc3d874f9b48a27c97e68525e60fd7" type="folder">2018-0059</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cf0f9d529eae94c2879ac933dd202bad"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We present a multidetector X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, developed in collaboration with the Laboratory for Cultural Heritage (LABEC) in Florence.

Although the explosive feedback can reproduce many of the observed properties of the galaxies, such as the stellar mass-halo mass relationship, it creates disks that are too thick. In this paper we present a study of the effects of the radiative feedback on gas cooling inside the simulations and its effects on the galaxy structure. This includes the ionizing radiation coming from young and old stars. In addition, a new model for the UV background radiation, represented by the radiation coming from other galaxies or active galactic nuclei, has been implemented, which proved to have a lower feedback effect compared to the old NIHAO implementation. The star formation rate is reduced after the introduction of the new local photoionization effect, due to an increase in the cooling time of the gas. However, due to the above-mentioned effect of the new UV background, most of the properties of the newly simulated galaxies have attained values similar to the ones in the old simulations. The thickness of the disk was not significantly affected.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e33f86a1135419445049c1f487ec5701" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sinha, Vamika. <emph render="italic">Nature versus Nurture: Star Formation Rates in NIHAO</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0103</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_fbcaa55c6568cd5dec9d7f48dbaf85e5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_723139140c9ba8e3edd8b3617509561d" parent="aspace_fbcaa55c6568cd5dec9d7f48dbaf85e5" type="folder">2019-0103</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_57ed62b076b2cf8219715863db8c4a91"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>I study the star formation rates of galaxies throughout their lifetimes using a large sample of hydrodynamical, cosmological simulations. I show that blackhole feedback is successful in quenching star formation in the largest galaxies. I construct a new quantity, Δ log Star Formation Rate, that relates the star formation rate of individual galaxies to galaxies similar to them in age and mass. I find an inverse correlation between halo formation time, measured through galaxy concentration, and Δ log SFR. Galaxies with halos that form earlier tend to underproduce stars throughout their lifetimes, while late bloomers tend to be chronic overproducers of stars. This is evidence that dark matter may play more of a role in driving star formation than previously realized.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2c29090b954c70f4a3c1809493189039" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rosenthal, Michael. <emph render="italic">Mapping the Warped H2O Maser Disk in the Low-Mass Galaxy IC 750</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0098</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_23d812e1ade38f8199569a920707dfcd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0ddcea6e26f3e573df950e076e1cf244" parent="aspace_23d812e1ade38f8199569a920707dfcd" type="folder">2019-0098</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_aa132450bddb5815a65d039b8aaf4bcd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We present the first map of water masers in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of the dwarf galaxy IC 750.

The disk lacks emission around the galaxy recession velocity of 701 km/s, so we fit Keplerian rotation curves for a 0.5 x 0.5 mas grid of possible dynamical centers. By accepting only centers for which the masses determined separately from each side of the disk agree within 5%, we determine a best-fit BH mass of 8.0 +0.8 / -0.4 solar masses.

For the purpose of this project, we studied the behavior three accretion models in the NIHAO simulated NIHAO galaxy population. We studied the Bondi-Hoyle accretion model coupled with black hole feedback, the gravitational torque accretion model, and the viscous disk accretion model which both do not require black hole feedback. For each of the models, we probed the interaction between black holes and their host galaxies through in- vestigating black hole-host galaxy scaling relations and examined the observed co- evolution of galaxies and their black holes. This was accomplished through running numerical simulations of galaxy formation, post-processing analysis, and utilizing observational data sets to constraint the model's parameter space. We report that all models match observations down to redshift 1, and note that the viscous disk model shows the strongest co-evolution between the black hole mass and the stellar mass, the gravitational torque model shows co-evolution at high black hole masses, while the Bondi-Hoyle model shows no co-evolution.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_0e5151abd08d21b6f21d614fb2628bcc" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Psychology</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref70_k5u" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Neyadi, Layla Mohamed Sultan Mohamed. <emph render="italic">Cross-Cultural Perceptions of the Hijab: How Middle Easterners and Westerners Respond to Veiled Women</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0053</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_0d3e5131ffc831b8a866881310b843bd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_fa0c323a128348233c8aa7206f2226d7" parent="aspace_0d3e5131ffc831b8a866881310b843bd" type="folder">2014-0053</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e4f48fe8df24c1b1357795c5165f881d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Psychology <lb/>Abstract: Numerous qualitative studies have investigated why Middle Eastern women may choose to veil. The work suggests that many women veil for reasons other than religious obligation. Some of their reasons include veiling as a means to protect their individuality and sense of agency, a claim in direct conflict with Western stereotypes of veiling as an oppressive and objectifying practice. Do these reports signal important cross-­‐cultural differences in a perceivers' spontaneous responses to veiled women? To address this issue, the current investigation explored the rapid objectification of veiled and unveiled women by Middle Eastern and Western perceivers, using two standard measures of implicit associations. While the results did not provide evidence of objectification, they signaled the dehumanization of veiled women across cultures. Both Middle Eastern and Western perceivers considered women who veiled as less human than non-­‐veiling women. In addition, Middle Easterners also dehumanized women more than Westerners, regardless of their headgear. A second task, however, did not support these conclusions, potentially due to poor test validity. The obtained results provide tentative evidence for cross-­‐cultural consistency as well as divergence regarding the perception of (veiled) women.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Dehumanization</subject><subject source="local">Objectification</subject><subject source="lcsh">Stereotypes (Social psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Discrimination</subject><subject source="lcsh">Hijab (Islamic clothing)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Head Covers/Veils</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref80_iss" level="file"><did><unittitle>Badwan, Iman R. <emph render="italic">Intergroup Contact and its Effect on Social Identification: The Case of Filipina Workers in the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0048</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_8a898c2c26f6f68da47c3db3b3fd3dd6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_a0f093c5e43d66fe73875710459b82f4" parent="aspace_8a898c2c26f6f68da47c3db3b3fd3dd6" type="folder">2014-0048</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_84b858688a27f87f363553fa1df5dc8a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Psychology, Visual Arts <lb/>Abstract: The possible effects of contact, relative to the interactions according to location, have been examined on group-based identities of Filipina women in Abu Dhabi and Manila.

Recent evidence indicates, however, that this processing preference may be culture-dependent. Egyptian perceivers, for instance, show the opposite face processing pattern; an effect argued to reflect their frequent exposure to faces void of external facial features (i.e., female faces covered by headscarves). To further examine this claim, spontaneous recognition accuracy for internal facial features was assessed, using a standard part-whole face recognition task, in Western perceivers living in New York and Middle Eastern perceivers living in Abu Dhabi. Accuracy scores were submitted to a 2 (perceiver culture: Western vs. Middle Eastern) x 2 (target face race: Caucasian vs. Arab) x 2 (face probe: part vs. whole) mixed measures analysis of variance. As predicted, Middle Eastern perceivers outperformed Westerners with regard to recognition accuracy. Merely on trials that required recognizing isolated face parts of Caucasian faces, both groups of perceivers performed equally well. Importantly, Middle Easterners also reported higher exposure to covered faces in everyday life than Westerners. In combination, these findings provide evidence that culture-specific face environments can impact basic aspects of face recognition.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Face</subject><subject source="lcsh">Head Covers/Veils</subject><subject source="lcsh">Hijab (Islamic clothing)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Facial recognition (Psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Cross-cultural comparison</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref59_pky" level="file"><did><unittitle>Park, Hyun Kyung. <emph render="italic">Processing Code Switch in Highly Proficient Korean-English Bilinguals</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0047</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_2c7f337509ece11c2270dc5f9530bf45" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_05ca8751d4ddbc623c41657a4c3bbe3e" parent="aspace_2c7f337509ece11c2270dc5f9530bf45" type="folder">2014-0047</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_45a74cbaa3e9880fa931ec0cedb20885"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Psychology <lb/>Abstract: Code switching is a cognitive aspect of bilingualism. Code switching has been linked to a processing cost, with the inhibitory mechanism in language selection leading to an asymmetrical switching cost in low proficiency bilinguals, but a symmetrical cost in high proficiency bilinguals. Given the limited literature on intra-sentential code switching that high proficiency bilinguals have been reported to do, as well as on bilinguals of genealogically distinct languages, this study used the self-paced reading paradigm to investigate the presence, extent, and symmetry of a switching cost in highly proficient Korean-English bilinguals. The results showed that there was no overall switching cost, but instead a marginal advantage when switching from Korean to English. Because there was no switching cost, there was no symmetry or asymmetry to be interpreted in light of the inhibitory mechanism.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Code switching (Linguistics)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Bilingualism</subject><subject source="lcsh">English language</subject><subject source="lcsh">Korean language</subject><subject source="lcsh">Language and languages</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref377_u3o" level="file"><did><unittitle>Haynes, Robert Clark III. <emph render="italic">Auditory Speech Priming as a Means of Exploring Linguistic Storage Mechanisms</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0040</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_2d8b910c8383ba90553e14085b0d6cc0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_cc6a21d1969a08168cb16637dcf569b0" parent="aspace_2d8b910c8383ba90553e14085b0d6cc0" type="folder">2015-0040</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c062f21228313e42fa26afa80ce99955"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Psychology<lb/>Abstract: This paper examines theories of lexical access, particularly regarding morphological decomposition of spoken words.  Two competing theories of lexical access, William Marslen-Wilson's Cohort theory, and James McClelland's and Jeffrey Elman's TRACE model, differ mainly in their treatment of phonology in lexical access.  Marslen-Wilson (1994) has also posited that morphemes are the most basic unit of lexical storage.  To test these, and other more recent models, we used a subliminal auditory speech priming method designed by Kouider and Dupoux (2005) to determine the roles of phonology, morphology, meaning, and lexicality is lexical access.  We find no effect of morphology, and posit that lexical processing, beyond determining whether an utterance is a word, requires that utterances enter consciousness before unconscious parsing can take place.  We also find an inhibitory effect of pseudowords, which suggests that lexical access is not a serial process and that familiarity with words may also play a role in processing.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Morphological decomposition</subject><subject source="lcsh">Subliminal perception</subject><subject source="lcsh">Speeches</subject><subject source="lcsh">Morphology (Linguistics)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Priming (Psychology)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref389_itp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mohmad, Farah. <emph render="italic">Examining the relationship between motivation and aspiration: The effect of home and school environment on educational aspirations</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0033</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_9e1cb595f2c36309d62a3cabf80c4a03" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_13ed61dc043072dd68b9fcef79ba4f92" parent="aspace_9e1cb595f2c36309d62a3cabf80c4a03" type="folder">2015-0033</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1cc0430e23499e00959cf39e4537de8a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Psychology<lb/>Abstract: Previous studies demonstrated a relationship between motivation and aspirations in school-aged children (Mertens, 2012), the present study reveals the intricacies in this relationship. This study examines the effect of manipulating motivation on students' educational aspirations. Participants were 169 students in 5th, 7th, and 9th grade from schools in Chennai, India who completed a questionnaire that included two conditions: positive outcome focus (i.e., reaching the goal) and negative outcome focus (i.e., failing to reach the goal). After the manipulation, students reported their predicted performance levels during and after the school year. The results support our hypothesis of motivation having an effect on aspiration where students in the positive outcome focus condition reported having higher short-term and long-term aspirations. Our results also showed an interaction effect between motivation and perceived student support. Students who reported having low perceived student support had significantly higher short-term aspirations in the positive outcome focus condition than students in the negative outcome focus condition. The results might help school counselors and teachers to increase the motivation of students in secondary schools and therefore, increase their aspirations.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Support systems, Social</subject><subject source="lcsh">Manipulation (Psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Affluence</subject><subject source="lcsh">Aspirations, Student</subject><subject source="lcsh">Motivation (Psychology)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref450_dtz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mészáros, Eszter. <emph render="italic">Comprehension of Verbal Negation in Early Childhood as a Cue to Logical Inferences.</emph>  </unittitle><unitid>2016-0033</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_bea82bd44a386f63fa4785f46494ded7">English-learning infants were shown to have "no" in their active vocabulary for almost a year before they understand it as truth functional negation (e.g. Feiman et. al, under review).

The present research investigated the relationship between passion for academics, emotions, and cognitive performance. Results indicated that students with an obsessive passion – a strong internal pressure to engage in the activity — experienced high levels of negative emotions while taking a cognitive test, which impaired their cognitive performance. Students with a harmonious passion — a strong desire to freely engage in the activity — experienced low level of negative emotions, which facilitated their cognitive performance. Implications for positive psychology and educational interventions are discussed in the way in which positive psychology elements reduce negative emotions for harmonious passion, and improve cognitive performance. The promotion of these positive psychology elements can be done through school environments and classroom activities.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_bc2ff59ebf9cbda657f8ec7dd9512114" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bauer, Ann. <emph render="italic">Interpersonal Consequences of Self-Sacrifice </emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0074</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_22cc6a961e2560b9be2bae860e0288b3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_e912fd744c8a5a476dfc37a3f2d2336d" parent="aspace_22cc6a961e2560b9be2bae860e0288b3" type="folder">2018-0074</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f65792f353c1c09922df3d1e273c7f03"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Significant research has been devoted to understanding the personal motivations of ideological activists.

In the following study, we hypothesized that seeking out social support during such impactful life events can predict positive perceptions of said events. We also hypothesized that participants identifying as relatively more individualistic would make more negative self-event connections due perceived low quality of social support. Our participants included 180 undergraduate students from New York University Abu Dhabi and Western Washington University representing 7 ethnicities. We used 3 types of personal narratives and 2 questionnaires—the MSPSS and the RIC scales—to collect data. Results showed that participants indicating higher levels of seeking social support during impactful life events did indeed make more positive self-event connections and participants identifying with an individualistic cultural self-aspect made more negative self-event connections. Significant gender effects were also found. Social support is an essential part of the human experience and this research was done in hopes of strengthening the scientific foundations on which we can build these arguments.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_7b707cd5235b23c9173cbdedb3bd2f1b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Meehan, Jessica. <emph render="italic">Do Attention And Visual Working Memory Share A Common Search Template?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0062</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_2c9cc8da3468bfabd85ba466977dfd18" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_09bf5c1ae9ac737cf54325974d504c81" parent="aspace_2c9cc8da3468bfabd85ba466977dfd18" type="folder">2018-0062</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_887b7eb1257e43fd55fda1068c5ccdf6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Our ability to selectively decide on and search for a specific item in space is made possible through the interaction of two cognitive processes; attention and working memory. Recent literature has proposed that the two processes may be interdependent. Studies have shown that the template used during visual search is maintained and influenced by the contents of visual working memory (VWM). This study used a task that combines memory and search demands for a single target item. Depending on the type of trial, participants were asked to either search for the stored item amongst similar distractors, or to adjust a sample line to match the orientation of the stored item. Previous research has shown that explicit knowledge about the context an item will appear in can modulate search away from expected distractor items to improve performance. Based on these assumptions, if the search template and VWM representation rely on a single template, then adjustment away from the context in a search task will bias the representation of the item in working memory in the same direction. These findings suggest that the two tasks do not exclusively draw on a common, single template.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_abd285bef338d043612109c0e447c82a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nomani, Amber. <emph render="italic">Now You See It, Now You Don't: Effects of Interference on Unconscious Working Memory</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0079</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_7468262b5d421d3f6c6acf0caabf8583" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_f8c6741a2852242bfb33c182784d6b4f" parent="aspace_7468262b5d421d3f6c6acf0caabf8583" type="folder">2018-0079</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_38148ec458ba52d1e979406e9612c399"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Working memory (WM) is traditionally considered to be a conscious process during which information is currently being used. It is where information is held while we complete a task, or recollect an old memory. Recently, studies have shown that it is possible to maintain information in working memory even in the absence of conscious awareness. This means visual information from the environment may be processed without the awareness of the individual and we can also process them in the presence of distractors which require attentional resources. This study consists of three spatial WM tasks which aim to understand the limits on unconscious WM by testing the effect of interference, and compare these effects to the effects on conscious WM. We predicted an attractive effect of participants' responses to the object of interference in each experiment. As such, we found that there was a trend in attraction of the participants' responses towards the position of the presented sample on the current trial due to proactive interference, and also a trend in attraction of responses towards the location of the distractor due to retroactive interference. However, there was no significant difference between unconscious and conscious WM for the different tasks.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ac02d5a8e36bbbeaca301cfdb2f798b4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Omari, Deemah. <emph render="italic">Cultural Differences in Mothers' Visual Attention During Mother-Child Play </emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0058</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_54804fa19546799a02406fbc9ddbb86c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_cd3f452ba891c956ec999aa84f471635" parent="aspace_54804fa19546799a02406fbc9ddbb86c" type="folder">2018-0058</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_caaf140cc7880b1424f1b62a9175b7a9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Mothers' visual attention plays a large role in in children's interactions during early development. Using two samples of mothers from India (n=34) and Germany (n=34), this paper explores the distribution of maternal visual attention during mother-child play. The study will tackle two research questions: (1) Is mothers' visual attention consistent in frequency across different types of play? And (2) are there cultural differences in German and Indian mothers' visual attention during free or structured play? For the first question, it was hypothesized that mothers direct their visual attention more at the child in free than structured play, and more at the object in structured than free play. For the second question, it was hypothesized that Indian mothers look more at the child than German mothers, while German mothers look more at the object. Results supported the first hypothesis, but provided no support for the second hypothesis as there was an insignificant interactional effect of type of play and culture. Culture showed a significant main effect on maternal visual attention. Implications and limitations are discussed.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c58088d3554a9b70f2c5f50344917aee" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tahan, Rosy. <emph render="italic">Investigating Early Lexical Processing Using Script Changes: Evidence from Arabic and Arabish</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0075</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_16aeee913d2ae13cbb4dc95639168ae5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_c8c0968787caa40a3e6ecd6fce2e1150" parent="aspace_16aeee913d2ae13cbb4dc95639168ae5" type="folder">2018-0075</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_07f96d951f1e42679667c5c4c4f5990c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In language experiments, priming, particularly in conjunction with the lexical decision task, has assumed access to the mental lexicon.

The present study is based on Almeida and Poeppel (2013) found similar behavioral priming for words and pseudowords, but different electrophysiological responses. We designed an EEG lexical decision experiment using words and pseudowords written in Arabic and Arabish, expecting N400 priming responses and a word- and orthography-specific P2 response. We found robust behavioral priming for both words and pseudowords, but EEG results were generally not significant.

Specifically, I looked at how participants' endorsement of either hostile sexism or benevolent sexism is related to their acceptance of four types of lesbian relationships in China. Chinese undergraduate students from Sichuan province (N=550) filled out an online survey. I found a main effect of benevolent sexism, gender, and type of lesbian relationship on people's acceptance of lesbian relationships. The results showed that 1) acceptance of lesbian relationships in general was negatively associated with endorsement of benevolent sexism, but not hostile sexism, 2) compared to men, women overall found lesbian relationships more acceptable, 3) lesbian relationships with a masculine lesbian and a feminine lesbian were the most acceptable, and lesbian relationships with both masculine lesbians were the least acceptable among the four types of relationships. The results suggested that it is important to differentiate between men and women' attitudes, as well as between different types of lesbians or lesbian relationships. It also highlights the importance of studying gay men and lesbians not only as individuals, but also in relationships.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_01213bc2bc914aa2f5e062bdaa22a6c0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al-Hajeri, Jude. <emph render="italic">Examining the Lasting Effects of Daycare on Attachment Security: An 18-Year Prospective Longitudinal Study</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0085</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_8bc6640509291f8ce8e18a71a2efd7b9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_9c742ec4ca8afe02a0efee171eba3927" parent="aspace_8bc6640509291f8ce8e18a71a2efd7b9" type="folder">2019-0085</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_882ebd147ff9533960cd23c7abb25c32"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Early childhood experiences are crucial when it comes to developing attachment representations with primary caregivers.

This study examines the associations between early daycare experiences (i.e. quality and quantity) and attachment security (i.e. secure base script knowledge) at age 18 years. It was hypothesized that there would be a significant association between quality and quantity of care on secure base script knowledge in adolescence, such that higher quality care would result in positive developmental outcomes. Results indicated a small association between daycare quality and attachment security at age 18 years, but this effect did not hold when accounting for critical demographic and caregiving variables (i.e. maternal and paternal sensitivity). These results suggest that early daycare experiences are transient, leaving no significant effects on attachment in adolescence.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1d0b7f6be75e1e5d1238d6bcd5989300" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Khezam, Muna. <emph render="italic">Investigating the effect of bilingual education in the United Arab Emirates on Emiratis</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0093</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_1da8ea58f49dde41d6f50df8a43958ee" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_b0872996dc971ccf2aed347294240b0a" parent="aspace_1da8ea58f49dde41d6f50df8a43958ee" type="folder">2019-0093</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_085872f27ccb6eceb6b076223fb60351"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) has been traditionally used in the educational setting in the Arabic-speaking world, while local dialects of Arabic are used in daily informal settings, including in the United Arab Emirates. However, English-medium education is becoming increasingly more popular in the UAE among the Emirati population. We conducted a survey to investigate how the effective competition between MSA-medium versus English-medium education in the UAE affects the construction of Emirati identity in nationals and their linguistic attitudes towards MSA, Emirati Arabic and English. Results indicated that Emiratis educated primarily in private English-medium schools reported a negative attitude towards MSA, but a positive view of both Emirati and English. Emiratis educated in MSA-medium public schools reported a positive attitude towards MSA and Emirati. Daily Emirati usage and promotion of Emirati Arabic in the public and private spheres were considered important to all participants, including in the construction of their personal identity. Similar positive attitudes towards MSA, however, were highly correlated with the amount of MSA-medium schooling participants had, with primarily English-medium graduates reporting only a positive attitude towards Emirati, not MSA.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_94d389f6318f860f6dca6b47edf621fc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alshuhoomi, Fatma Abdulla. <emph render="italic">Backlash against equality: How threats to the gender hierarchy affect attitudes toward reproductive freedom and violence against women</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0070</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_92171f1b8a4b7f0e63343f2243ad68e7" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_77d6431d2b44000f9590c831ba0368f4" parent="aspace_92171f1b8a4b7f0e63343f2243ad68e7" type="folder">2019-0070</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_20c2f5fa5a16d74817494eda85ece8dc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Desire to preserve the traditional gender hierarchy is linked to beliefs that women should be controlled non-violently (i.e., giving men more control over women's reproductive rights) and violently (rape myth acceptance and minimization of severity of sexual and physical violence).

Study 2 (N=1178), participants read a paragraph depicting the gender hierarchy as "stable" (men hold more power than women), "changed" (women already achieved equality), or "changing" (women currently in the process of advancement towards bridging the gender gap). Results showed that when the gender hierarchy is perceived to be changing (vs. stable or already changed), people were higher on rape myth endorsement, especially those high on HS.

Attitudes towards gay men  and transgender women were highly correlated. People in Western countries report more positive attitudes toward gay men than transwomen, while the opposite is true for people in non-Western countries. Overall, people in Western-countries have more positive attitudes than in non-West. Women tend to have more positive attitudes than men towards both gay men and transwomen. There is negative, significant correlation between both hostile sexism and benevolent sexism and liking of gay men and transgender women in Western countries. However, in non-Western countries only hostile sexism has positive, significant correlation with attitudes. I also tested whether gender moderates the relationship between sexism and attitudes. Only in Western countries, benevolent sexism was better predictor of women's attitudes  towards transwomen than it was for men.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_289bd5593b3dd397788718494ee45112" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aslanian, Araz. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Implicit Racial Bias on Recognition of Own- Versus Other-Race Faces</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0118</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_25bc370cb7c800223a4046be40af3c76" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_e234062d3655dcbe0ff2560e7eb0eba5" parent="aspace_25bc370cb7c800223a4046be40af3c76" type="folder">2019-0118</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_553ff9547e6d67d6b9447c3f29867d25"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Recognition of own- and other- race faces might be modulated by observers' face recognition ability, social experience, and implicit social biases.

During the memory task, eye-tracking was used to track participants' eye movements. The memory performance for own-race faces was positively predicted by increased face recognition ability only, whereas the memory performance for other-race faces were positively predicted by increased face recognition ability, social experience with Asians, and negatively predicted by increased positive bias towards Asians, which was modulated by an interaction between face recognition ability and implicit biases with the effect of bias observed only in observers with high face recognition ability.

The present study examined this topic by investigating the relationship between age and goal-pursuit strategies. We hypothesized that autonomy — feeling free to make decisions and to behave in ways that express one's true interests — may be the psychological mechanism explaining this relationship. A mediational study provided support for our hypotheses. Specifically, age was positively related to autonomy which in turn was positively associated with goal facilitation and negatively associated with goal interference. These results provide support for the growing claim that older adults are also subject to developmental gains.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0bab94ec0ca81024b2ca6ccd2fab2911" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gu, Yufei. <emph render="italic">The Influence of Early Childhood Attachment Quality on Secure Base Script Knowledge Development in Chinese Children</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0121</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_7b66f84a79dc2eb4bc8ed84dd40f57e9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5119efb192fad988854a7cde0c0a44d4" parent="aspace_7b66f84a79dc2eb4bc8ed84dd40f57e9" type="folder">2019-0121</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dad7b50f1275d37c9e3df2ddad5e9745"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Attachment theory argues that the quality and consistency of parental sensitivity and responsiveness to their children is internalized as a mental representation of attachment relationships. Interestingly, all longitudinal studies on the development of attachment representations to date have been conducted in Western contexts. Leveraging data from a longitudinal study of child development in Nanjing, China, we conducted the first test of the hypothesized link between early caregiving and later development of attachment representations in a non-Western context. We analyzed data collected from subsample of an ongoing prospective longitudinal study of Chinese families (n = 78). Observations of mother-infant interactions were recorded when the infants were age 14 months. Attachment security was assessed at age 10 years using the attachment script assessment adapted to the Chinese context. Partial correlations revealed significant positive correlations between maternal sensitivity and maternal positive regard observed at age 14 months and secure base script knowledge at age 10 years. Maternal intrusiveness during play was not significantly related to secure base script development. Overall, results supported the culturally universal prediction from attachment theory that the quality of early caregiving impacts the development of a secure attachment in the child.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_dcc2b214efb8137f68c139fcd84ae900" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gyawali, Sneha. <emph render="italic">Mothers' goals and strategies for toddlers in gift reception across three cultural communities</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0101</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_539f9ff9934f83ca174dc0895fa5a8e0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_076bc6122fe5da164122a751b7fcbcd1" parent="aspace_539f9ff9934f83ca174dc0895fa5a8e0" type="folder">2019-0101</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_97084d5be1041e16807cff17d1d7a262"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The study investigates how mothers across three cultural communities describe goals and strategies for toddlers during gift reception, specifically with regard to their autonomy and relatedness.

A recent proposal implicates ensemble perception in visual phenomenology. However, a key assumption of this proposal – that ensemble perception can occur even in the absence of conscious awareness of the items in the ensemble – remains untested. To test this assumption, this study investigated whether ensemble perception of spatial location can occur unconsciously. In Experiments 1a and 1b, participants reported the average spatial location, or centroid, of ensembles of dots presented either within or beneath their threshold of conscious awareness; in Experiment 2, participants reported the spatial location of a single dot within the ensemble. We found that participants were able to accurately report the centroid of unconsciously-presented ensembles when the dots were clustered closely together, but when the dots were presented as two separate clusters, they appeared to report the centroid of a single cluster rather than the centroid of the entire ensemble. Furthermore, participants could not accurately report the location of individual dots within unconsciously-presented ensembles. Taken together, our results offer preliminary evidence that unconscious ensemble perception is possible, but limited.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6f28bb839753a986d334972c0df97385" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lee, Seoyoung. <emph render="italic">The Role of the Parahippocampal Cortex in Scene Integration</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0123</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_f6a2b44728b4ba75ef342be75eeb6b17" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0420784c93e653a43a7a698aca7e0479" parent="aspace_f6a2b44728b4ba75ef342be75eeb6b17" type="folder">2019-0123</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_877699f30a5e46916a7f52601e26d334"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Humans perceive a coherent visual world across time and space. To update incoming sensory information while maintaining a stable representation of the environment, previous studies have suggested the role of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) in scene processing and ensemble processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how the PPA might integrate information by relying on continuous spatial-temporal sequence of information flow, or mere shared elements in a scene. We used scene images that were divided into three segments, with 66% overlap between the first and second segments and 33% overlap between the first and the third segments. Participants viewed the three scene segments either sequentially or in a displaced order, identical segments for three times, or three completely different scenes. We found that the left and right PPA not only showed significantly stronger activations for different scenes than identical scenes, but also for different scenes than three segments originating from the same scene. Moreover, the sequence order of the three segments did not affect the response magnitude. These results suggest that although the PPA may not be sensitive to the sequence of information flow, it appears to integrate segments with shared elements to form a coherent representation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_645418ebadd54d0f3c0d56070952184d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Noll, Ella. <emph render="italic">Automatic Post-Editing for Arabic to Japanese Machine Translation</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0069</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_320c0950e06b510bb3463ed5d574f276" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_daff0bd4c4aa0d4e43d190bf9ad7378a" parent="aspace_320c0950e06b510bb3463ed5d574f276" type="folder">2019-0069</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5cc10f6b50cba8a164f0240e02c7cabe"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Machine Translation research had made impressive improvements in the last two decades; however this success has not spread equally to all language pairs, with some language pairs receiving a lot more attention in terms of research, and resource and system development.Arabic-to-Japanese is a pair that has not received much attention.In this project, we present results from, and detailed linguistic analysis of the output of, an automatic post-editing system for Arabic-Japanese machine translation that exploits a corpus of Arabic-Japanese news articles.

Vallerand's Dualistic Model of Passion (DMP) divides passion into the two distinct categories of harmonious passion – which involves an autonomous internalization of and engagement with one's passion – and obsessive passion – which involves a controlled internalization of and engagement with one's passion. The present research explores the relationship between passion and themes of narrative identity – i.e. a person's internalized and evolving life-story (McAdams, 1985)), especially with regard to the themes of agency, communion, redemption, and contamination (McAdams, 1996). Results revealed a strong positive correlation between harmonious passion and themes of communion. Obsessive passion was not significantly correlated with any narrative theme. In addition to discussing the implications of the relationship between harmonious passion and themes of communion, the present study provides a foundation for future research to investigate the applicability of qualitative analyses on psychological constructs like passion, which are usually studied quantitatively in social psychology.</p></scopecontent></c></c></c><c id="aspace_209570724935ccbb44e160486e10ab1b" level="series"><did><unittitle>Social Sciences Division Projects</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2019" type="inclusive">2014-2019</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_ac04f3313f34b3672ad4142d19a7af04" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Economics</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref82_you" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Mazrui, Shamma Sohail Faris Ghanem. <emph render="italic">Expectations and Aspirations of Educated Emirati Females in the Transition from School to Work</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0091</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_f51e21df2163e583a3b95e500a9fc568" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_37b76abad4d2d54762f2854b79861050" parent="aspace_f51e21df2163e583a3b95e500a9fc568" type="folder">2014-0091</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_04523b2114d66eb7ceb710e100279319"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/> Abstract: Even though initiatives to increase the number of Emiratis in the private and public sector have been in place since 1980s, the results in the private sector are not impressive. Existing literature argues that Emirati workforce participation in the private sector is due to structural and attitudinal factors. Few studies exist that identify and explore Emirati females' attitudes towards and expectations of the labor market. This paper reports the results from a survey of 107 educated Emirati females who are in the transition from school to work. Their responses indicated an expectation to work and contribute to society. The findings show a great deal of similarity of attitudes towards the private and public sector. In contrast to previous research, the findings unveiled an inclination towards a multicultural environment, a perception of education and experience as important factors for obtaining a job (as opposed to wasta and "family background") and a lack of information on government initiatives and private sector opportunities. The findings lay the foundations for policy recommendations that would integrate this untapped pool of talent into the labor market.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Expectation (Psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Vocational aspirations</subject><subject source="lcsh">Women</subject><geogname source="lcsh">United Arab Emirates</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref114_576" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Shaikh, Huda Abdulrahman Abdulla Abdulrahman. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Family and School Environments on Skill Development: A Case Study of the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0077</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_b0bad357cd3668ffb9ea433fae630f94" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_fc672df134a7a2b7ab3d2efa3d1523be" parent="aspace_b0bad357cd3668ffb9ea433fae630f94" type="folder">2014-0077</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_950896b9a7f5d75f1aeda0f4cd2732e0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/> Abstract: The UAE has witnessed a period of vast economic growth and development that spurred after the discovery of oil. One of the main areas of focus right now is in the investment of human capital especially for UAE nationals.

This paper argues that both school quality and family environments are equally significant determinants in developing both skills and cognitive achievement. Using PISA 2009 data for the UAE, the study finds that positive school environments and certain family characteristics do have a positive impact on student achievement.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Academic achievement</subject><geogname source="lcsh">United Arab Emirates</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref99_48d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Almehairbi, Ahmed Masaood Ahmed Almasaood. <emph render="italic">Global Wage Structures in the Context of the Nineties' Economic Liberalization: 1991-2004</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0063</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_7417dc3e6831da766b928cb3f4197e4d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_73fd1796d477560386645c490e1a0ba9" parent="aspace_7417dc3e6831da766b928cb3f4197e4d" type="folder">2014-0063</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cd39134f0594e3e186184f19bed80be8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/> Abstract: In many economies, wage structures underwent drastic changes during the nineties. During this period, a rapid and deep process of trade liberalization was implemented. This paper studies industrial wage structures in a group of advanced and developing economies from 1991 to 2004. Workers' industry affiliation provides an important channel through which trade policies can affect the wage structure and inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Specifically, this paper tests whether those sectors where import penetration deepened are also the sectors in which, ceteris paribus, a higher effect on wage structure is observed. Several significant results emerge from this analysis: (1) import penetration and tariffs are more correlated with wages for unskilled workers. (2) In unskilled- intensive industries, import penetration is positively correlated with wages. (3) In skilled-intensive industries, the correlation between import penetration and skilled workers is positive only to a certain cut-off level of tariff where it then becomes negative. (4) There is an overall convergence in skilled-unskilled industry wages, more so in advanced than in developed economies.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Nineteen nineties</subject><subject source="lcsh">Imports</subject><subject source="lcsh">Trade</subject><subject source="lcsh">Trade liberalization</subject><subject source="lcsh">Wages</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref111_k71" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bassini Ortiz, David. <emph render="italic">To What Extent Has Trade Liberalization Reconfigured the Mexican Economy?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0073</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_06d53be0c46637e1e31af3de0bdd7692" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_49e122a1ce27cd45556bedc9b32c7155" parent="aspace_06d53be0c46637e1e31af3de0bdd7692" type="folder">2014-0073</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dc829ea056350c59fa828461762d347b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: In this paper, I look at GDP and TFP growth rates from manufacturing sectors of the Mexican Economy to show how trade liberalization has reconfigured the country's economy. While standard trade theory predicts that labor-intensive sectors would benefit from trade liberalization, my findings indicate the opposite. There has been a divergence between labor and capital-intensive sectors; that is, capital-intensive sectors have flourished while the labor-intensive ones have stagnated. Additionally, I propose that the Chinese presence in the U.S. import market has prevented labor-intensive sectors to reap the benefits of NAFTA.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Trade liberalization</subject><subject source="lcsh">Total factor productivity</subject><subject source="local">Standard trade theory</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref81_3s0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Boutros, Jasmine Alexis. <emph render="italic">Analysis of Sector Shares of GDP During the Global Economic Crisis</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0079</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_017b151b8544d315a5da96bef29591e6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_9094ab3392ff779bd456bab640cfad2d" parent="aspace_017b151b8544d315a5da96bef29591e6" type="folder">2014-0079</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fe2dc526ca0552f285123c94082285fa"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: In this paper, I compare how the sector share to GDP of advanced, emerging, and developing economies relate to GDP growth during the crisis period of 2007-2010.

Generally, options are priced using Black-Sholes-Merton formula (BSM), but that methodology is inherently flawed: pre-supposes the lognormal nature of returns for the underlying security. Many researchers have attempted to formulate better approximations. The paper, Mixtures of t-distributions for finance and forecasting written by Giacomini, Gottschling, Haefke and White (2008), is of particular relevance where the usage of Student's t-distributions for option pricing is analysed. With fatter tails these distributions would resemble the actual stock options data more closely. However, after an attempt to replicate the results derived in the paper many discrepancies have been found. Hence, a comparison shall be made between our results and the aforementioned variations delineated.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Student's t-distribution (Statistics)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Options (Finance)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Finance</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref112_jau" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kang, Tae Young. <emph render="italic">Leaders Do Matter: Brief Analysis on Leader Constraints and Economic Performance</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0095</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_2af685ddb99da0815c5ddaf9c78bee3f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_92888d0e3715cf8bca2f1c30599f8d06" parent="aspace_2af685ddb99da0815c5ddaf9c78bee3f" type="folder">2014-0095</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_757c909f60fb7086b9da26849c6fdf99"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: In this paper, we tried to understand the fundamental difference between democratic and autocratic systems, and after exploring the gap between the two, analyzes market performance for given autocratic systems based on the leader characteristic, represented by their exit strategy.

Pre-tax gross wage serves as the proxy to measure the quality of human capital while population by educational attainment acts as the measurement of the quantity of human capital. The regression estimation model explores the role of institutional factors such as rule of law, government effectiveness and corruption from Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) in determining wage for population in different educational level. Despite institutional factors appear to be statistically insignificant in predicting wages, prediction results enjoyed similar college premium level to actual data and related literature.

Furthermore, the role Financialization plays in the growth of Muslim countries will be explored in the search for solutions to development issues and particularly issues within the financial services sector.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Financialization</subject><subject source="lcsh">Markets</subject><subject source="lcsh">Finance (Islamic law)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Economic growth</subject><subject source="lcsh">Economic development</subject><subject source="lcsh">Finance</subject><subject source="lcsh">Islamic countries</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref119_alp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Safdar, Neelgoon. <emph render="italic">Remittances and Consumption of Public Services: Empirical Evidence from Pakistan</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0087</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_6ec2d45f78239dc605b593733fd71067" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_1633d30c3b7f44f16e18b157abd7029b" parent="aspace_6ec2d45f78239dc605b593733fd71067" type="folder">2014-0087</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d3722ded213856d88abaae9cd14a1999"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: Remittances are now one of the largest forms of foreign direct investment, providing a stable form of private aid to households in developing countries. While much of academia has focused on the positive impact of remittances in the area of development, less attention has been given to the political economy implications of such unearned foreign income. Studies discussing the negative impact of remittances on government behavior have assumed that remittances encourage a sectorial glide towards greater use of private substitutes to public services (ie. private schools versus public schools). This means that an increase in remittances should be correlated with a decrease in public services. Using cross-sectional household survey data from 2004-2005 and 2010-2011, this research study shows how remittances do not have a significant economic impact on the usage of public versus private schools and hospitals in Pakistan.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Public services</subject><subject source="lcsh">Emigrant remittances</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Pakistan</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Government</subject><subject source="lcsh">Health</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref129_31l" level="file"><did><unittitle>Shenderyuk, Oleg. <emph render="italic">Pareto Distribution of Russian Stock Market Returns</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0089</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_870492024749023fb393b7b969ef3fec" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_c62737492f8a94a953f8ea2b776a9c44" parent="aspace_870492024749023fb393b7b969ef3fec" type="folder">2014-0089</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b6484b472ceee44c75b700f2ae951b04"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics, Mathematics <lb/>Abstract: This thesis is looking into which statistical trends the returns of Russian Stock Index (RTS) follow. It turns out that RTS standardized returns converge in tail to Pareto distribution. The same is true for the stock markets of developed countries. The analysis goes into the precise characteristics of such distribution for RTS and, as the result, the power coefficient of Pareto distribution for RTS is significantly lower than that of developed countries, which implies higher volatility and higher frequency of "extreme events" for Russian market which is expected, given the features of Russian political and economic system.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Markets</subject><subject source="lcsh">Econometrics</subject><subject source="lcsh">Finance</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Russia</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref110_cxj" level="file"><did><unittitle>Skakov, Bagdat. <emph render="italic">VAR approach to the sectoral analysis of FDI - Economic growth relationship in Kazakhstan</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0065</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_34af098c1cae9e554ec4a8c4f72e0cf5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_3850cdb259f4647fea2de92f7b120794" parent="aspace_34af098c1cae9e554ec4a8c4f72e0cf5" type="folder">2014-0065</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c1beb23d55cf14a0144e2283ec02d351"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics, Arab Crossroads Studies <lb/>Abstract: Foreign direct investment (FDI) is speculated to have a positive effect on growth by policymakers in many developing countries.

In the sharing economy, trust and reputation not only offers a premium, but also is necessary for transactions to take place. Consequently, digital peer-to-peer marketplaces like Airbnb that facilitate these transactions must consider how their platform's various mechanisms and features impact trust within their marketplace.  This paper considers Airbnb's Instant Book option, a feature emphasizing convenience at the expense of trust, and shows how users opting in to this feature may face a discount by unknowingly signaling they are not as trustworthy.  Understanding the relative importance of and dynamics between trust and convenience in these new digital peer-to-peer marketplaces will make for more robust platforms.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Internet</subject><subject source="lcsh">Trust</subject><subject source="lcsh">Consumption (Economics)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Consumer behavior</subject><subject source="lcsh">Markets</subject><subject source="local">Airbnb</subject><subject source="lcsh">Sharing</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref121_1dt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tang, Connie Kelly. <emph render="italic">Induced Travel Demand and Induced Roadway Supply in the United States</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0067</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_be16dae2db73870b37ac844e51a218fe" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_6c90913715bc3a4cb4acdd30c0edc5fc" parent="aspace_be16dae2db73870b37ac844e51a218fe" type="folder">2014-0067</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_720def1f020855f4f819b61713877795"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: This paper utilizes the simultaneous equation model (3SL2) to determine the relationship between travel demand (as measured by vehicle miles traveled) and travel supply (the availability of local lane miles).

Students of the university, like many other residents in the United Arab Emirates, have little incentive to refrain from wasteful consumption. The dormitory residents are divided into two groups, control group and intervention group. The control group received no treatment, whereas the intervention group signed consent forms for participation in the experiment (first type of intervention) and received letters with information of where does their electricity and water consumption stand against their peers (second type of intervention). Consent form and a sample of peer comparison letters can be found in the appendix. The results show that the intervention group consumes more electricity but less water than the control group does. The asymmetry of electricity and water consumption can be explained with elasticity of demand and change in outside temperature. The structure of the experiment is simple and transparent suggesting that such project can be implemented on a larger scale for institutional purposes.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Demand-side management (Electric utilities)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Electricity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Consumption (Economics)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Energy</subject><subject source="lcsh">Water</subject><geogname source="local">Saadiyat Island</geogname><subject source="local">New York University</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref124_pyz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Trinh, Diem Dam Trang. <emph render="italic">A new model to measure Chinese GDP An Empirical Analysis</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0074</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_84260eea2407d039733d1c9c12acbc19" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0293bfb16eef37dea85f6c89c10f15e8" parent="aspace_84260eea2407d039733d1c9c12acbc19" type="folder">2014-0074</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b71f4010c179ba7c8230eca334667ae9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: In 2012, the Chinese economy reached $8.4 trillion, making it the world's second largest economy (after United States at $15.7 trillion). The increasing concern about Chinese statistics reliability is not a new story. There have been professional attempts to develop a proxy for the Chinese economic activities. Yet there has been insufficient justification for the reliability of these proxy variables. This paper develops a new model to measure the Chinese GDP with the reference to a cross-country analysis from 1960 to 2012. The new estimation shows that the Chinese GDP is much more volatile than the official GDP figures.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">China</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Gross domestic product</subject><subject source="lcsh">Statistics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref109_tr0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Vaidyanathan, Madhav. <emph render="italic">The Quantity-Quality Trade-off of Fertility: An Empirical Study in India</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0083</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_77fd844c5fdb7abcaeaa095cfb8cf38a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_e5a4bdc4e90665107db60c2a601665ad" parent="aspace_77fd844c5fdb7abcaeaa095cfb8cf38a" type="folder">2014-0083</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_473a0582ba793f4e38dc5e0ca9f05c48"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: Several studies have sought to empirically test the theoretical model on the quantity-quality (Q-Q) trade-off of children in a family, first introduced by Gary Becker. Using a representative sample of data from three surveys in India (National Family Health Surveys), I conduct an empirical examination of the Q-Q trade-off of children. I use both linear and non-linear specifications of family size and study the nature of the trade-off both across time and the rural-urban divide. Furthermore, I adopt the use of an instrument (sex of the first born child) for family size to address the issue of endogeneity. My results suggest that the Q-Q trade-off holds and that the trade-off is surprisingly higher in urban areas. In addition, the trade-off appears to be declining over time, but marginally. The results have to be assessed with caution, especially when studying the estimates across time (survey) as the instrument appears to be weak and even invalid in some specifications.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Sex</subject><subject source="lcsh">Rural-urban divide</subject><geogname source="lcsh">India</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref93_my5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yntiso, Sidak. <emph render="italic">Self-Confidence in Decision-Making (Experimental Methods and Evidence)</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0092</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_fa15915bd96f64fb167ecb6041b47274" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_831925d5b67c310187f67a05dcf83e5d" parent="aspace_fa15915bd96f64fb167ecb6041b47274" type="folder">2014-0092</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_39521bd95af217ad4142a0973df75d39"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: Do individuals interpret ambiguous feedback optimistically or pessimistically when their self-esteem is at stake? Ertac (2011) finds that generally people overweigh negative performance feedback which leads to overly-pessimistic beliefs about ability. If these results are valid and generalizable, more studies are necessary to study the effects and extent of pessimism. Towards this end, I have replicated Ertac's experiment with a number of differences in methodology (performance groups, signal and payment). In confirmation of her findings, after participants received an accurate yet negative signal, there was a significant pessimistic effect in belief updating. This paper also compares belief-accuracy across two types of belief elicitation mechanisms – the quadratic scoring rule and the crossover mechanism. There is no significant difference in belief accuracy between the two mechanisms.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Belief updating</subject><subject source="local">Elicitation mechanisms</subject><subject source="lcsh">Pessimism</subject><subject source="lcsh">Self-confidence</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref278_1x7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Halaby, Razan Tony Michael. <emph render="italic">Student Loans: What are the Economic Benefits of Investing in Higher Education in the United States and is it Worthwhile for Students Taking out Student Loans?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0056</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_0c812d269fb64083ddb3a18f6446c48b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_3372c3bfff56c39346a9f663098da413" parent="aspace_0c812d269fb64083ddb3a18f6446c48b" type="folder">2015-0056</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_41e4f2ea7c0faf1b59527e604bea5645"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics<lb/>Abstract: College as an investment, is it worth it? People decide to pursue higher education because of the expectation of future economic success based on educational attainment. Assuming that higher education will have the following benefits: higher annual entry wage, lower unemployment rate and higher wage growth, many pursue it. More so, students are driven to take out loans and apply for financial aid to invest in attaining a higher education. However, will the economic benefits of attaining a higher education degree compensate for the amount of debt that student in the U.S will graduate with. This research illustrates the economic value of an education by measuring the added value of a high school or college degree.

Through the use of large, global LBO transaction details from March 1987 to September 2014, we discover that issuers and debtors of high-yield debt differ in their perception of risk, indicating debt mispricing. As private equity firms arbitrage from the mispricing, we find that they increase the valuation of their target companies by 0.0317% – 0.0486% given a decrease of the cost of borrowing high-yield debt by 1%. Furthermore, higher magnitude of debt mispricing is associated with LBO transactions of larger absolute size that exclude equity in their financing package.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Leveraged buyouts</subject><subject source="lcsh">Risk</subject><subject source="lcsh">Private equity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Debt</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref296_6vp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kang, Danyang. <emph render="italic">Effect of Information on Consumer Perception: Evidence from Restaurant Hygiene Grades Cards in New York City</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0049</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_8cde0433a1c3e1930eb36d31149638e6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_1056674fbe7271291a81599a1289004d" parent="aspace_8cde0433a1c3e1930eb36d31149638e6" type="folder">2015-0049</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_997211e62f4dce3c93816ac9abbd31c3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics<lb/>Abstract: This study examines the effects of increasing provision of hygiene quality information on consumer assessment of restaurant quality.

A common source of such arousal is a victim's story and image. In my paper, I study individual and group contributions made towards helping Moke, a 7-year-old child living in Democratic Republic of Congo, suffering from a dermatological condition. In my experiment, I control levels of identification by offering the image, name, and age of the victim to the treatment. My experiment confirms the existence of the "Identified Victim" effect in individuals: individuals contribute more towards helping an identified victim than an unidentified victim. Importantly, I extend the study to groups to find, surprisingly, that groups contribute more towards helping an unidentified victim than identified victim. Finally, the results also demonstrate that groups are less selfish than individuals: i.e. compared to individuals, groups contribute more towards the unidentified victim. To explain the findings, I propose a new theory that draws on the empathic altruistic hypothesis and the social comparison theory.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Individuals (Persons)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Groups, Social</subject><subject source="local">Identified victim effect</subject><subject source="lcsh">Rationalism</subject><subject source="lcsh">Fundraising</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref298_tia" level="file"><did><unittitle>Zhu, Weichen. <emph render="italic">Difference Between Veteran and Civilian Real Wage Distribution from 1980 to 2010 in the United States.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0058</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_26f9b458dfb702bd49257d2c7cb891b2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5c1a6893933781d5084c763dffcee8c2" parent="aspace_26f9b458dfb702bd49257d2c7cb891b2" type="folder">2015-0058</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_026c51f1deecee4d9195877587ff2c36"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics<lb/>Abstract: Veteran and civilian wage difference is an important topic in labor economics and public policy. This research seeks to answer two questions. First, is there a significant difference between veteran and civilian real wage from 1980 to 2010? Second, if there is, what are the potential reasons that can explain the real wage discrepancy? The empirical evidence reveals that veterans in fact earn higher real wage than civilians from 1980 to 2010. The fluctuation of the veteran real wage premium is correlated with shifting composition of veterans from different wars. Evidence regarding social work, working hours, and racial heterogeneity of veterans is insufficient to explain veterans' higher real wage than civilians.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Wars</subject><occupation source="lcsh">Workers</occupation><subject source="lcsh">Veterans</subject><subject source="lcsh">Wages</subject><geogname source="lcsh">United States of America</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref462_62m" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ahmad, Emaan. <emph render="italic">Traditional Institutions or Geography: Determinants of HEalth Outcomes in Sierra Leone.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0051</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_73958ed0c8714c7ac2d625854e6ba38b">Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world with one of the weakest health systems and lowest health statistics.

Control variables used are household size, characteristics of household head (gender, education level and occupation), household demographics (whether rural or urban), number of income earners and household facilities (including washing machine, TV, flush toilet and car); in an effort to prove that expenditure shares are allocated differently across provinces. The main finding is that having at least one tobacco consumer in the household results in a negative effect on the expenditure shares of food, education, rent and healthcare.

The paper focuses on the differences between domestic partnerships and marriages as it relates to voter turnout. The paper further explores how the effect of various turnout-predictors varies for the two relationship types. The paper shows that domestic partners are more vulnerable to negative effects of low income, low education, the presence of children, high residential mobility, and low religious attendance.

This paper examines the impact of the election on stock returns of the Standard and Poor's 500 (S&amp;P500 hereafter) constituent firms, as a function of corporate social  responsibility (CSR). I hypothesize that more socially responsible firms underperformed relative to their industry peers in the immediate aftermath of Trump's victory. To this end, I apply an event study based on regression estimation of abnormal returns using both Fama and French Three Factor Model (FF3F) - adjusted  returns and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) - adjusted returns. I find that, contrary to expectation that high CSR firms would be "trumped" or disproportionately punished, the coefficient for the interaction between the event dummy and ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) performance is positive and  significant, meaning that mean abnormal returns increased with CSR.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_47e6c5b72a9de3b948752471da8f5778" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chandrasekar, Vishwanath. <emph render="italic">An Economic Examination of the Bitcoin Network </emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0108</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_96d65adc9ce08455675f1b8b882fdf54" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_b5b8c2c0ff5b32ac27ba993da90d7689" parent="aspace_96d65adc9ce08455675f1b8b882fdf54" type="folder">2018-0108</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_262fa32dbb3e6185d4779cf4493f62cf"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper examines the Bitcoin Network through the lens of Economics.

The article then creates a panel data fixed effect model to measure the relationship at question. The results indicate that decreasing transportation cost by 1% increases deforestation by 0.3%. Complementing this main finding the article identifies a data time trend whereby deforestation increases by 0.1% annually.   In doing so this article aims to provide data for enabling more informed legislative decisions and reducing the grey area of 'uncertain environmental effects' which often result from new infrastructure projects. The data herewith presented should hopefully aid in guiding a more sustainable and informed approach to Congo's development, one which takes greater care of the Congolese rain forests, currently occupying 46% of Congo's total land area.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_593b310639b1c58813643b5a835f17b6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ellis, Rhoshenda. <emph render="italic">The Oil Curse: Oil and Economic Growth</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0158</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_4fbd7f9333ef6dab73055de2ca9018bd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_51a9697e7d3ed386b7bc5ef34adfe35a" parent="aspace_4fbd7f9333ef6dab73055de2ca9018bd" type="folder">2018-0158</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ca37e92f76e37cc9bf87fcfb54f99ff5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper seeks to examine the impact that the presence of oil as a natural resource has on the economic growth of a country while taking into consideration the type of governing regime. It hopes to dispel the evidence of the oil curse, which states that oil rents often undermine democracy, and slows down economic growth by promoting corruption and state instability. This research builds on that of Sala-I-Martin's I Just Ran Four Million Regressions by adding oil and political factors to the empirical growth model that he uses. This research employs ordinary least square regression with economic growth as the dependent variable during the period 1990 – 2014. The main findings of this research was that the countries in this dataset show that oil did not have a negative impact on growth even when controlling for the type of political regime in the country during the period.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_78ad3b692da15cabd67ede2e51fa632c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Erkinjonov, Aziz. <emph render="italic">Sovereign bond spreads in emerging market economies and their macroeconomic fundamentals</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0142</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_5651e4d64ba17cd5fb20c40e2d83c21d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_297726110efa7a2548a1300646756b28" parent="aspace_5651e4d64ba17cd5fb20c40e2d83c21d" type="folder">2018-0142</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_51e12bbea0252ca268a7253ce0ff214c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper tests several hypotheses.

How has the intensified import competition from China affected unemployment, regional wage receipts, and voter attitudes in the European Union, its largest trading partner?   Analyzing labor market and electoral data from 25 European countries at the NUTS 2 regional level between 1999 and 2016, I find that Chinese import competition is associated with lower general and long-term unemployment rates as well as higher regional wage receipts for the manufacturing sector and across sectors. Nevertheless, voters in the exposed regions express stronger protectionist and anti-centralization sentiments as well as more favorable attitudes towards domestic free trade policies.   I use an instrumental variable approach to isolate the supply-driven component of the Chinese trade shock and find that the results are robust to specifications that use current and lagged imports to different groups of high-income countries. The results imply that import competition from China benefits the exposed regions at the aggregate level, but still leads voters to adopt economic-nationalist sentiments.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_da3a254c0e9f6c71f84580691c6408c5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ivanovska, Violeta. <emph render="italic">Bitcoin: The Ultimate Speculative Asset?

This paper sets out to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive investigation of the price behavior of Bitcoin, the most valuable and liquid cryptocurrency in existence. The paper takes a threefold systematic approach by addressing three key questions pertaining to the unusual price evolution of Bitcoin. First, what are some long-run determinants of Bitcoin's price formation between 2012 and 2017? Second, can speculation in the Bitcoin market lend explanation for the cryptocurrency's noteworthy price fluctuations in 2017? Finally, is there any evidence of bubble-like behavior in the Bitcoin market in recent years? My results show that while variables conventionally used to study financial asset pricing do not provide much explanation behind Bitcoin's price evolution, speculation and bubble-like behavior were key contributors to Bitcoin's unusual price development in recent years.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e81ff9bbc4955e1a56690c960bfbf6e2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Juns, Alens. <emph render="italic">Beta Asymmetry in Bull &amp; Bear Markets in the Eurozone and its Applications in Spread Trading</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0111</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_8074b69665a1b5e858bd595562b5771f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_b6073b87866fd63ab65e9851ceb7eab2" parent="aspace_8074b69665a1b5e858bd595562b5771f" type="folder">2018-0111</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_04c10b0c2c945535bc76004967baebe4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this paper I use the dual beta model (DBM) to estimate bull and bear betas for individual stocks and then compare the performance of bear betas versus standard betas in creating hedges in a spread trading strategy.

It picked up pace starting the early 2000s. In an age where virtually all countries are experiencing unprecedented globalisation simultaneously with sharp increases in income inequality, the question of a link between the two arises naturally. This paper attempts to investigate the effect of globalisation on income inequality across countries with varying income levels. It focuses on the differences between the economic development and the income levels of these countries and how these influence the impact of globalisation.    The empirical evidence presented provides support to the claim that globalisation adversely affects income inequality in Upper-middle income and Lower-middle income countries. Thus economic policy-making for these countries should incorporate considerations regarding income distribution when pursuing globalisation. The paper finds no evidence of globalisation being correlated with income inequality in High-income and Low-income countries.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_611e2ff093400577bb5ef01923112fef" level="file"><did><unittitle>KIm, Mina. <emph render="italic">Gender differences in returns to migration: Does motivation matter?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0122</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_98cc4ee22c80d33b2986d16aeef5ba90" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_93cc18d469b9a5d01d8a00cbb8ae75d8" parent="aspace_98cc4ee22c80d33b2986d16aeef5ba90" type="folder">2018-0122</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4bc74d4bdebf8b9d9b0c80aca075ad56"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper employs the sixth round of Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) data to quantitatively verify (1) whether men and women select into migration for different reasons and (2) whether this heterogeneity affects their returns to migration.

Previous research on financial integration of the initial members of the Eurozone identifies a strong link between joining the monetary union and improved financial integration through bond, equity, and credit markets. This paper applies similar models related to the equity markets to a new set of Eurozone countries. Moreover, it explores possible negative effects that recessions might have had on the financial integration and accounts for other country specific factors that might affect investor behavior and hinder the rate of financial integration. By comparing various measures of equity market convergence this paper finds that the financial integration was indeed slower when the new EMU members joined the Eurozone compared to the countries that joined the EMU in 1999.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f1704a0ac9e887b458938f2356220c7f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lama, Ugyen. <emph render="italic">Islam and Prosocial Consumer Behavior</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0131</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_950d39ba1bc7767eb643ce7b729ad8da" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_271192c1f81993037f1f521cc54ff4fe" parent="aspace_950d39ba1bc7767eb643ce7b729ad8da" type="folder">2018-0131</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d88e6c1714b0aea8bbd5a5371e8ca928"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) models have been widely adopted by many companies and has become core to their businesses.

This paper proposes an experimental design to study the direct effect of religion, in particular Islam, on consumer behavior and tradeoffs made in purchasing decisions. The experiment aims to study the consumer behavior of subjects who are religiously primed to trigger the Muslim identity and assess if they are more likely to pay more for products from companies known for their CSR efforts.

More recently, "self-competition" has been suggested as a strategy to increase gender parity. This study attempts to replicate the finding that self-competition eliminates the gender gap present in traditional competitive scenarios, recruiting the same sample and using nearly identical procedures as a previous study. The self-competition effect does not replicate: a weakly significant gender gap persists in self- competition and no evidence of a meaningful difference between other- and self-competition is observed. Risk attitudes predict competitive choices in all conditions, and the self-competition effect observed in the original study appears to be due to low score variance and learning effects reducing the riskiness of self-competing. The evidence suggests that policies for inequality reduction should aim to directly address gender differences in confidence and risk aversion rather than emphasize self-improvement.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c08f27b9eddce4755842b03c0cda04b2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Melkerte, Laine. <emph render="italic">Gender, Competitiveness, and University Study Choices</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0124</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_54980d4c7dae0d59d013149a607384a9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ddc9a31bf904ae36ab3f9116aa74140f" parent="aspace_54980d4c7dae0d59d013149a607384a9" type="folder">2018-0124</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d623a551d2ff900ef0a56b89484ce0e5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The emerging literature examines whether gender differences in willingness to compete can explain the gender differences in education choices.

Furthermore, we did not find evidence that an appreciated real exchange rate is the channel through which an aid-induced Dutch Disease occurs.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_106290691f254da01f4ee2a7e47779bf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Muralidharan, Ritu. <emph render="italic">Trade Deliberalisation and the Spatial Distribution of Firms: The Bifurcation of Bihar, India as a Natural Experiment</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0165</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_8459e0a07e1f2e4b65b439d4d690dfe4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_38b991ca74d203c6eecf6233a4f8182a" parent="aspace_8459e0a07e1f2e4b65b439d4d690dfe4" type="folder">2018-0165</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3b855a87d6b370f1948008c672bcb882"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>An inter-state tax on trade was in effect in India until 2017. How did this tax affect firms and workers? In November 2000 the state of Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar to facilitate the development of its tribal population. This new border was an exogenous shock to trade between Bihar and Jharkhand. We use the bifurcation of Bihar as a natural experiment to examine the extent to which trade deliberalisation through the creation of additional state borders affects the spatial distribution of firms. This empirical study uses a difference-in-difference estimation strategy and geocoded village-level data to find two key results. First, a discontinuity in the number of firms and workers emerged along the border by 2013, with lower numbers along the Jharkhand side. Second, it seems like Jharkhand was able to invest in itself to allow for the better provision of public goods along its side of the border.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8aa61d0ac23da25f8355f23d8f6ff82d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nasr, Amer. <emph render="italic">Short-Run Events and Stock Market Reactions: Early Evidence from the Economic Blockade on Qatar</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0141</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_26b6e05a0723d4ae5f7469bc1cd86cb9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_38ee9031a043598dae85ab28c557e29e" parent="aspace_26b6e05a0723d4ae5f7469bc1cd86cb9" type="folder">2018-0141</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_376e531573de26da47f3a6706d413ec1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>An unprecedented economic blockade imposed by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia on June 5th, 2017 resulted in the suspension of trade with Qatar. Using a regression based event study, this paper aims to observe daily variations in the returns of the Qatar All Share Equity Index (QEAS) to determine the effect of four event announcements on and around the official days of the announcement of the economic blockade. First, the returns of five Middle Eastern country indices are regressed upon three event windows to find that only the QEAS reacts significantly to the focus event. Second, the returns of seven different industry sectors in Qatar are regressed upon the same three event windows to find that the transportation and consumer goods and services sectors were most affected by the blockade. Third, the returns of all forty-three companies that are publicly-listed in the QEAS index are regressed on the same three event windows to analyze firm-specific return reactions over each event of interest. Although there is predictive power in assuming negative abnormal returns as a result of negative news announcements, this paper analyzes the short-run market shock of the blockade on the performance of the Qatari economy.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_fab02fec6fb54279437e0644212a8d4c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Orozco, Angela. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Mobile Phone Diffusion on The Law of One Price for Commodity Markets in Ghana</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0151</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_6451df0c80d9af278e95590ea59dc94f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_90e43d07a1f080f9d51c8019a25665c1" parent="aspace_6451df0c80d9af278e95590ea59dc94f" type="folder">2018-0151</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cb6885c4e62cbc20af725424c09a7ce6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Limited or costly information can prevent economic agents from engaging in optimal arbitrage and cause price dispersion across markets. Consequently, goods may not be allocated efficiently. As a result, information technologies may improve market performance since they reduce communication costs and allow individuals to send and obtain information quickly and cheaply on a variety of economic, social, and political issues. This paper evaluates the effect of mobile phone diffusion on the price dispersion of commodity markets in Ghana. Using geographical data on mobile phone usage as well as market-level price data, it shows that the adoption of mobile phones is not associated with a reduction in price dispersion and does not hold to the Law of One Price. Furthermore, this report dismantles the effect of mobile phone adoption for different regions and different commodity types. It finds no difference in effect between southern and northern markets and it concludes that the effect is greater for retail markets than for wholesale markets, as well as greater for non-perishable commodities than for perishable ones.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_db20b492e7ba446267b87997f42b77bb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Huynh, Nghiem Quang. <emph render="italic">Mechanism Design with Limited Attention Agents</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0133</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_f60e645714cf56b8780162ba53153bd8" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_1684c704cd3065d502c739b162ca382c" parent="aspace_f60e645714cf56b8780162ba53153bd8" type="folder">2018-133</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dd196dd5c8206d8189c88c5e4313c72d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We relax a common assumption in mechanism design that agents never fail to consider all available options.

We propose a weaker version of strategy proofness and extend the rectangular property. We show that these new conditions are necessary and sufficient for our implementation concept. Our results corroborate the importance of attention on the performance of strategy-proof rules in experimental settings.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6afdab8b4ebe9ee61cf39260fc015097" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rashid, Myera. <emph render="italic">Why are Millennials Job-Hopping?

Recent studies have found that despite the long-held view of 'the more the merrier', larger assortments have a number of important drawbacks related to an increase in cognitive costs. How is this context refined when we apply it to student motivation and the process of choosing undergraduate classes? Based on data collected from 326 students at New York University, this study proposes that individuals choosing from extensive choice sets experience lower post-choice satisfaction and increased feelings of regret. Building on the general proposition, the paper identifies additional internal factors —importance of choice, preference certainty, experience, and decision-making type— and examines whether they moderate the relationship between assortment size and choice overload. The results reveal that some internal factors do have this effect, and what's more, the impact differs between individual decision-makers. These findings suggest that assortment size alone cannot predict when choice overload is likely to occur, and raise the question of what factors influence individuals' post-choice sentiments.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5342eee6a341950bab72412c29377524" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sugita, Taiki. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Landmarks on Neighborhood Development</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0150</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_d6e1f4310151b0b95e826dab8850908f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_7a3c2d0a07a8d7b959ccd23dc23993b2" parent="aspace_d6e1f4310151b0b95e826dab8850908f" type="folder">2018-0150</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_48e78694fa9d306a1aacdc832d14d680"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>New York City is often held up as a successful example of a city that underwent gentrification alongside Paris, London, and other metropolises.

In this paper, I examine whether the effect of iconic branding brought by the concentration of landmark buildings in Brooklyn generate physical (1) and financial (2) development in neighborhoods. Results indicated landmark buildings caused an increase in share of residential and office units, creating an inbound of more business and people to move in, as well as a rise in value of properties in close proximity.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9fcc03c9e55f2d6faaa6984dc95cbb45" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tursyn, Ruste. <emph render="italic">Sovereign Wealth Fund Investments: Short and Long-Term Stock Price Impacts</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0143</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_4d1ac04e4dbb2b5d9a54f23e2e6f4588" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_c23e2e350b23de1f0b12938290d85f0e" parent="aspace_4d1ac04e4dbb2b5d9a54f23e2e6f4588" type="folder">2018-0143</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5aa5557bcf8ab76f2208a0c071497a30"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this paper, I studied the impact of Sovereign Wealth Fund investments on public firms in which those funds invest.

This study is the first to examine the effect of exposure to competition from agricultural imports on the performance of the domestic agricultural sector in a context allowing for insights into efficiency oriented trade policies of developing economies. Examined in this paper is Ghana's rice market, where for over a decade around 70 percent of demand has been met by imports, despite the right agronomic conditions to produce rice in Ghana throughout the year. I approach this question by analyzing the relationship between rice farm's productivity and exposure to rice imports, proxied as proximity to the coastline, where foreign rice accesses Ghana's market. Data obtained from GLSS 6 demonstrates a robust negative relationship between the distance from the coastline and farm's productivity, which on its face defies the infant economy logic and predicts higher productivity where competition is high. Yet, there are two possibilities: either farms learn to become more competitive or inefficient farms quit rice production where competition is too high. Further analysis provides some evidence for the latter theory, but more research is essential to address the puzzle.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_78a7d4a4b55161ffc7903a2845a652fb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yahia, Suraiya. <emph render="italic">Preferences in the Workplace and the Clash of Generations.

We contribute to the existing sparse literature on generational differences in the workplace by presenting a method to disentangle cohort effects from age and period effects based on epidemiology empirical research. This study shows that Millennials, especially younger members of the generation, are more likely to have higher preferences for meaningful jobs compared to Generation Xers and Baby Boomers. However, older members of the Silent generation exhibit similarly signi cant cohort effects, refuting Millennials' "exclusive" differentiation in job preferences relative to meaning. We show that while country setting and educational attainment have a signi cant effect on generational cohort variations relative to job preferences, their impact on preferences is very heterogeneous with often polarized bearings.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2c934112bc0b4526ee8f4977a73b140d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abboud, Alia Amr Ali Mohamed. <emph render="italic">Currency Devaluation and The Stock Market An Event Study on the Case of Egypt</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0143</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_bb77f50e8365e182d0f2698c2f065e2b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_7e56904f69c9256e9627a70a3a42bd68" parent="aspace_bb77f50e8365e182d0f2698c2f065e2b" type="folder">2019-0143</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_119c31b2f63b1208dd47e76c57d3fa8b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper studies the effect of the floating and/or devaluation of currency on the stock market in Egypt using an event study methodology.

Indian Premier League (IPL) games have bigger effects on property crimes and have not shown significant effects on other grouped crimes. The study also contributes to the general discussion of sports and crimes against women as well as ethnic and religious minorities. In the majority of the observations, except of IPL, no serious effects regarding crimes against women and ethnic minorities were found. The results provide evidence for the non-economic theory of crime, but also in some instances show effects on economic drivers of crime.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4e02fd4c1166911cb5ac4ed1c6215f7f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Anto, Keith. <emph render="italic">Undoing Racial Discrimination: An Unintended Consequence</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0204</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_6b829f725411cec89b0129cdb2ac9066" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_8052da48cd0dff3e69977d50a8dcbb4c" parent="aspace_6b829f725411cec89b0129cdb2ac9066" type="folder">2019-0204</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_57e06da020094f7fad53d63fb48c15ba"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper explores serial independence of foul calls in the National Basketball Association (NBA). In 2007, Price and Wolfers found evidence for positive own-race bias in NBA referee decisions; they received great attention from the media and prompted wide criticism of referee behavior. Six years later, Pope, Price, and Wolfers (2013) found that raised awareness reduced the racial bias. Building upon this research, our paper suggests that in a conscious effort to seem unbiased and fair, following Price and Wolfers (2007), referees began to alter their foul calls based on the race of the players. They avoided long sequence of fouls on players of the same race. In our research, we find evidence for higher degrees of negative serial correlation or lower degrees of positive serial correlation in referee foul calls post-2007. Hence, in an attempt to undo racial discrimination, referees have failed to achieve color-blind decisions.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4607fc5b98911aa93b9909d75d6816c5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Assylbekova, Aidana. <emph render="italic">Entrepreneurship Education and Startup Development: The Case of the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0153</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_6c2d4840339640f689ada2d78358f699" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0cd8c6cb250ecb039dc3fe6dc7adcb01" parent="aspace_6c2d4840339640f689ada2d78358f699" type="folder">2019-0153</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f7d7f1ebaacb6d8bac839d7d65ab6aa5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>There has been done an extensive amount of research on the role of entrepreneurship education and startup development around the world.

The research uses 61 observations collected manually through an online survey and 12 in-depth interviews with UAE founders.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_65c3de045b523cae5fff03e5a4d800e0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Atwa, Firas. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Foreign Direct Investment Inflow on Entrepreneurial Activity: A Difference-in-differences Analysis of the Case of Egypt</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0191</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_cbe996ff6fe5165baf0403da7b2ac3df" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_086be1d36412704f331b106e5b713aeb" parent="aspace_cbe996ff6fe5165baf0403da7b2ac3df" type="folder">2019-0191</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c089bd6404d166e28c8bc37295e8478d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper investigates the effect of foreign direct investment on the performance of entrepreneurial firms in Egypt. The study explores the geographical variation in FDI inflows across Egypt, and uses a difference-in-differences estimation to measure the treatment effect from 2013 to 2016. Using firm-level panel data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey, the study uses intensive measures of entrepreneurial activity: firm sales and no of employees. The paper bases its choice of variables on the notion that, like new firms, many incumbent firms display entrepreneurial activity through growth in sales and size (Ahmed &amp; Hoffman, 2008). With approximately 4,000 entries, the paper controls for different sets of regressors, to minimize omitted variable bias. Overall, the results either display negative or insignificant effects of FDI on entrepreneurship. These results are consistent with findings in earlier firm-level papers like Konings (2001), De Backer &amp; Sleuwaegen (2003), and Barbosa &amp; Eiriz (2009), and are in line with the crowding out theory.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1809fbfc3a2b8d02bf5c926e662eefa1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bambysheva, Nina. <emph render="italic">Carbon Trade and Labor Markets in the European Union</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0139</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_9b8015b5ec1cd39f9c55d26566f4d6d5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_e6b47aace2ad15be39211ba1c8e0d083" parent="aspace_9b8015b5ec1cd39f9c55d26566f4d6d5" type="folder">2019-0139</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_56510f280a9fba9a99daee36ac2f91b1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Attempts to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change through various carbon pricing mechanisms consistently raise concerns over increased production costs and job displacement. This paper aims to estimate the impact of the largest of such arrangements – the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) – on labor market dynamics in the region in the third trading period of the ETS. Differently from the previous literature, we test the effect of both primary and secondary ETS market on employment rates across the EU member states. We find a small positive relationship between employment and carbon pricing. Results suggest that there is much room for interpretation of the impact of carbon markets on the economic activity of its respective region.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4a6b1499f03fd7261b2002b11c62bb2d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bartoszewski, Jakub. <emph render="italic">Immigration: Opportunity or Threat?

By 2017 around 2.5 million Polish citizens emigrated, creating a supply shortage in the labour market.In 2013 this situation started to change with a sudden increase of the number of immigrants from the former USSR, mainly Ukrainians, entering the Polish labour market. Their number reached 1.6 million in 2018.The immigration phenomenon coincided with a period of rapid growth of the Polish economy, leading to a lot of speculation about the role of the immigrants in the economic development of Poland. This Capstone Project explore the economic effect of immigration in Poland by approaching the most controversial part of it, namely the wage effect in the labour market. The methodology used in the project leads to a rejection of the hypothesis stating that the presence of immigrants has a negative effect on the level of Polish wages.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_00d8e35e10e2c8972aedf251cbcdf1b4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Benoit, Valentin. <emph render="italic">Professionalization of UAE-Based Art Galleries and Their Evolving Role as Cultural Entrepreneurs</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0183</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_0358fedcb53a343896c52e5cc51cfa20" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5f809d3f9065f2ff431e13d131a2d75f" parent="aspace_0358fedcb53a343896c52e5cc51cfa20" type="folder">2019-0183</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c8ecd60dfa8dee5f3cebe78fd06b77ee"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This qualitative investigation studies the emergence of the UAE art market by focusing on the developments of the primary art galleries.

There is extensive debate and literature that suggests that adaptation funding will come ultimately from the residents of developed countries via taxation. This paper, however, studies the willingness to pay (WTP) for adaptation from glacial flooding among university students in Nepal as a way to explore if residents of developing countries can fill the funding gap for climate adaptation. By eliciting WTP using a contingent valuation method, I see that university students in Nepal exhibit a positive value for funding climate adaptation. Consistent with other studies, I see that gender and level of income have a significant influence on the WTP value while information treatment does not. While the positive WTP value among students of developing countries can be used to fulfill the funding gap, it also highlights the urgency to which adaptation funding is required in vulnerable communities.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_39962d5c5576c51b786f9fb2bcbfb4ec" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bin Jaafar, Aldana. <emph render="italic">The Real Cost to Wed in the United Arab Emirates: A Study on the Economic, Educational and Cultural Determinants of Mahr in the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0197</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_29168f5e8d16ffdeb4e2a23bd691ef30" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ed632139c426c0cbdf2f4979b22708e9" parent="aspace_29168f5e8d16ffdeb4e2a23bd691ef30" type="folder">2019-0197</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d5af30c9361c07f6bfbbfb08606d6378"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Although it is widely discussed that dowry amounts in the United Arab Emirates have been on the rise, what influences such a change is yet to be understood. To examine the determinants of dowry, I administer an original retrospective survey to create a data set for marriage and dowry statistics. Over 1,500 observations were gathered to test for (1) assortative matching, (2) effects of a bride's characteristics on the size of dowry and (3) effects of a groom's characteristics on the size of dowry. Results reveal that there is a high degree of positive marital sorting by education, social hierarchy and wealth. Moreover, in a marriage market, women can bargain for a higher dowry or a spouse through their mannerisms (i.e. social hierarchy levels and educational attainment). Contrarily, the characteristics of men that are observed to have a significant and positive effect on the size of a dowry are considered to be materialistic (wealth and income levels). The results highlight important influencers of dowry size that will hopefully lend a helping hand to policymakers in impeding further dowry inflation in the UAE.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0fb447439ece79e09ffe264f0f7f13a5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bolysbayev, Daniyar. <emph render="italic">Wage inequality in Football Association: the case of English Premier League</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0205</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_8fced7793dcebb30b3b1b207d3613d39" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_a90421ef3b49b5c5fb2c91229540d90e" parent="aspace_8fced7793dcebb30b3b1b207d3613d39" type="folder">2019-0205</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_514ae373a575b99a2a23e9f6a88f4e3d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper tests for the existence of nationality, race and skin tone wage discriminations amongst players in the English Premier League.

In order to respond to the uncertainty millions of casual investors' experiences, I outline a predictive model that can provide a consistent way of estimating the prospective outcome reached by a given cryptocurrency (Azgad-Tromer 2018). The paper is chiefly concerned with the determinants affecting the token success defined as an aggregate of measures, including per-currency market capitalization. I propose that the most indicative analysis should be primarily based on a scrutinous examination of the network structure of the cryptocurrency-issuing companies. I believe the presence of the bonds among the employees of the coins, established through various incidents of shared employment noted in their job history, has an impact on the success of the firm. With the data from LinkedIn, a professional career-oriented website, used in the cryptocurrency field as a primary medium of promotion, I show that economic success of firms positively correlates with their centrality measures in the network. The analysis concludes the network structure of a company is a significant factor of success and can be used to predict the outcome of a particular coin.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_07b01b2dc9a7b92f1c8fda696662aa05" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cereceda, Flavia. <emph render="italic">Smart and Attractive: Exploring the Relationship Between Smart Cities and Migration</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0188</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_b06e53743333f6a1ce423474912a1ac3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_d2d04f0851734b03c2b955c2125f60df" parent="aspace_b06e53743333f6a1ce423474912a1ac3" type="folder">2019-0188</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2ff766acbc43086764b12edd79e51340"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper explores the relationship between a city's level of smartness and its net wave of migration.

We find that a hub airport has a significant impact on the attractiveness of a city for foreign investors. These results are robust to the implementation of a long-term difference which enables to control for potential remaining unobserved factors of the attractiveness of a city.

The hypothesis is that improvements on logistics performance offers competitive advantage for sectors that employ logistics heavily and therefore causing sectoral specialization trends as logistics intensive sectors grow relative to non-logistics intensive sectors.

Using a VAR approach and a series of post-regression tests, we conclude that: 1) Investors did not discriminate across EMEs before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) which led to strong intracontinental contagion; 2) Differentiation among EMEs based on macroeconomic fundamentals after the GFC is much more evident; 3) Specific factors such as trade patterns and currency exposure between the source country and other EMEs influence investors decisions, leading to heterogeneous responses to shocks and country-specific contagion; 4)the role of capital controls in explaining financial contagion is unclear given the limited availability of capital flows and foreign ownership data.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6998739ca13fcf30efba10703bc257b1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jiang, Henry. <emph render="italic">Do Industrial Parks Spur Innovation: Evidence From China</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0147</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_0f4248ee1e9fc749424fad4eae4c142b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_eab376d5c6326f8f9fc6845ee2b3d91d" parent="aspace_0f4248ee1e9fc749424fad4eae4c142b" type="folder">2019-0147</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0e1e4080f5e25e751c803c7184feead5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>With development of industrial parks increasingly favored by developing countries as a strategy to simulate domestic innovation, the relationship between industrial clustering and technological innovation has been a subject of intense interest and debate.

With fixed-effects regression analyses on an original panel dataset covering over 2000 industrial parks in China and spanning 19 years, I found no significant relationship between industrial park development and levels of innovation activities. The study controls for indicators of regional GDP levels and educational attainment and found increases in GDP per capita and proportion of residents with at least college education to be much more strongly associated with innovation capacity regardless of the level of government-initiated industrial clustering.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_215372441c305c50f2837672b058cba3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kalarickal, Joseph. <emph render="italic">Distributive Politics and a Simple Voter Game</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0146</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_58aaad72bb67cc65d097bc84c940b0ca" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_59b191debbc312cf3c3d0898b18df283" parent="aspace_58aaad72bb67cc65d097bc84c940b0ca" type="folder">2019-0146</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c25cb39e383b2cd24795a5b1de09c7c2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>People vote for different policies depending on the information that they receive.

This paper adds to the literature that investigates policies that are ex-ante preferrable but that fail to pass because these policies do not receive the majority vote. By using a simple two-person voting game, we find two equilibria one of which is trivial and one of which is responsive to the specific information provided for a voter. We implement the Fehr-Schmidt utility function which allows voters utilities to be inequity averse by incorporating the "shame" and the "envy" components. Ultimately, we find that this equilibrium is robust to this inequity aversion.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_17ef5b247ad9b2e1644294f83d2a9545" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lebedeva, Alina. <emph render="italic">Capital Structure Choices in the Middle East: The Case of the UAE Firms</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0138</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_55610d013eaaed3b817e2c4345921939" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_8333f2e164b9eab9cb3acd22800b6556" parent="aspace_55610d013eaaed3b817e2c4345921939" type="folder">2019-0138</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3d0f9ff5cd38c909a41e03a55c7d42de"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Financial markets of the Middle Eastern Arab countries have long evolved under the influence of the local culture and religion.

I tie their labor market participation and employment behavior to economic conditions. Using the Survey of Income and Program Participation dataset from 1995 to 2015 and employing a dynamic probit model, I show that labor market participation and employment status in the previous period overwhelmingly influence their status in the current period. I also find a that their transitions are substantially affected by changes in the state-level unemployment rate, but not from changes in the minimum wage. I estimate these effects for my whole sample and by race.

Communes are the smallest French territorial divisions and since 1982, raise a substantial part of their budget on their own following a
national policy on fiscal and administrative decentralization. The Ile-de-France region counts 1276 communes as of 2018 (INSEE) and offers the ideal set-up for a case study with the capital city Paris being at its center and it
offering data on many observable economic variables. The central question driving this thesis is the extent to which the public budget collected by every municipality is affected by the standard of living of individuals in that very circumscription. I hypothesize that living standards should consistently predict, across
time, budget size. If that hypothesis holds, the implication is that richer communes would get a higher budget per capita, therefore feeding into a cycle of positive cash recycling (i.e. more infrastructures and productive public goods). The poorer communes, where are located most of the banlieues and a large immigrant and second-
generation immigrant population, would then see a widening inequality gap in terms of available funds and therefore opportunities for social mobility. The findings point towards the existence of a time lag between living standards and budgets as well as a two-way causal relation; I find that income levels and quality of education
corroborate my main hypothesis. However, the data shows that the government is intervening to level up the budget inequalities through equalization schemes.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5dbf69dcdf72e78a67673b551793f21f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Papadimitriou, Esmie. <emph render="italic">Gender Differences in Loss Aversion</emph>

Buyers not only are consumers, but also act as intermediaries as they reproduce the good at zero cost and resell it to other buyers they have access to. Sellers indirectly appropriate profits from buyers along intermediation chains, but also enter into competition with buyers who replicate and resell. A network partition captures the effects of monopoly power versus competition. We extend the analysis to investigate the effects of limited resale opportunities on a seller's captive market and profits. By generating a directed network, we find that restricting resale expands sellers' captive markets when a network is su�ciently well-connected. Meanwhile, restricting resale limits diffusion and generates competition between buyers. As a result, a seller may be unable to extract profits from every buyer within his captive market, but he may obtain more than his bilateral monopoly share when the threat of dealing with the next highest-value buyer is credible. We find a formula to compute sellers' profits when there is no uncertainty in diffusion paths and competition between buyers does not interact with competition between sellers.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2e5ec24acbb8d53cfd02c3a5ed55e2e4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Radinovska, Veronika. <emph render="italic">The Impact of Infrastructure Development on Economic Growth: Evidence from China</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0194</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_5d21a2509626edb61eaf6ee62194e964" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ee827e4a089ad497852d35dcaa1c4467" parent="aspace_5d21a2509626edb61eaf6ee62194e964" type="folder">2019-0194</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3f4eebdaea25e5345784b333ed0b3253"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>China has demonstrated incredible overall economic growth in the past four decades, yet, regional development of the country has not been balanced: economically developed East drastically contrasts the rural West.

These works fail to include how a location's geographic (terrain) characteristics might influence the emergence of economic activities. Similarly, the conventional narrative among these existing works depends on the construction of actual transportation infrastructure which leads to a lack of exogeneity variation in the studies. This paper confines the study to a fixed geographic setting (Asian highland) as it faces its own sets of challenges and barriers to infrastructure development. To overcome the lack of exogeneity in the study, we use simulated travel routes taken by nomadic pastoralist for hundreds of years in the region as a proxy for the transportation network. We make use of nightlight intensity, population density, locations of road networks, and cities' locations to study how closely contemporary economic activities are established around the ancient travel routes. We find that there are positive economic outcomes in the region where simulated travel routes existed suggesting a long-lasting positive effect of infrastructure development on the economy.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_212a5e661a14cc4e8c9ea72ccbcace5a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ttappous, Michael. <emph render="italic">A Hedonic Price Analysis on the Impact of Macroeconomic Policies on Residential Rental Listing Prices in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0130</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_4bd389740cd217b73ef0f5c93b20f0b4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5ed23f0c10191b6f1fba772d8c6a587c" parent="aspace_4bd389740cd217b73ef0f5c93b20f0b4" type="folder">2019-0130</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d0f8aef1779ddc929e72dfc4007a12d2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This capstone explores the economic impact that macroeconomic housing policy decisions have had on residential rental listing prices in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.

With more coverage and decreased out-of-pocket percentage, there is both an increase in appropriate and necessary health services rendered as well as an increase in inappropriate and unnecessary services. Higher out-of-pocket payments also mean people either use medical services fewer times or that people are more incentivized to take better care of their bodies in order to pay less for health services. The methodology of this study is multiple statistical regressions on key health indicators and out-of-pocket percentage with varying control variables. Fixed effects regressions were also used to better eliminate the different intra-country effects on results. The results of this study find that increased out-of-pocket percentage of health financing increases health according to the key health indicators, with 4 of the 6 health indicators being statistically significant. Other findings include more statistical significance in wealthier countries that spend more on health expenditure than less wealthy countries, as well as no statistical significance between geographical locations.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b163763441acd08e9539954156224706" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yates, Thomas. <emph render="italic">Energy Investment in Developing Countries: Trends and Determinants</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0152</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_07c7004a5d4dcdd036fb1406041f2cad" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_80dd7d5a8dac0082830b4b07f51accdc" parent="aspace_07c7004a5d4dcdd036fb1406041f2cad" type="folder">2019-0152</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ce840fa0e069ca666f44bc396cb2df3a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Developing countries are set to drive the world's additional energy consumption between now until 2040. With climate change a major threat during this time period and linked to the use of non-renewable energy, the burden to invest in renewable energy lies upon developing countries. Yet, they face the dual challenge of expensive renewable energy sources combined with enticing Chinese investment opportunities in non-renewable energy sources. In this report, I analyse the energy investment trends of developing countries between 2014-2018. I then use regression analysis to understand the determinants of investment in renewable energy in these countries, of which energy consumption, energy shortages, and Belt Road Initiative participation are found to be significant variables.

(2017) claims that one cause for gender differences in labor market outcomes may be that women are more likely than men to receive and accept tasks with low promotability. Using a lab coordination game similar to the game of chicken, they argue that women have higher probability of volunteering than men and that such behavior is influenced by subjects' belief that women are more likely to volunteer. The experimental design labelling the volunteering task as "invest in a group account" raises questions on whether framing affects gender differences in the game and whether the conclusion is robust in a more diverse population. We applied three frames to the chicken game and conducted an online experiment. Our results show that framing increases volunteer rates for both genders but does not affect gender gaps. We also find that women indeed volunteer more than men across treatments and that women are more likely than men to expect their female colleagues to volunteer.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_735305b53bd3e1c89ac0dcaac23e5d18" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Legal Studies</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_51e227ad1479941429a25a05ba061d8a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Delano, Jack. <emph render="italic">Understanding the Legislative Spectrum of Sex Work: A Brief Case Study of the Netherlands, South Africa, and Sweden</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0202</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_092eb5732ea56302a8b9dc21e06ec3b6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_bb479d7dd81936dd37a84797b99e6ede" parent="aspace_092eb5732ea56302a8b9dc21e06ec3b6" type="folder">2019-0202</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_405e2e6beffcd3e7d8ea7c150a75a3c9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study explores legislative frameworks surrounding sex work, and how the legal environments of various contexts shape the social conditions around them. The study begins with an overview of understanding contemporary sex work, namely through discussing the key schools of thought in sex work debates, as well as the often-neglected but massively important topic of indoor sex work. Indoor sex work is discussed at length to discuss its potential as the most viable form of sex work for an environment where the practice is legal. After this discussion, three case studies are addressed, discussing the relationships between their respective legal systems and how sex work operates in each society. The case studies (the Netherlands, South Africa, and Sweden) are chosen to illustrate points on a broader legislative spectrum with regards to sex work. The study concludes by noting the immense differences in the needs of each case study with respect to improving their legal systems so as not to increase sex worker victimization. Additionally, it is concluded that none of the legal frameworks discussed represents an ideal scenario for sex workers, but each offer insights on how to improve sex work legislation in general.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_3d66ab7fa1ff8d9b22c40ca4ecc81bc2" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Political Science</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref133_oph" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bolton, Brett Michael. <emph render="italic">Introduction to Continuous Voting</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0066</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_5f54ff6c463ac2d289c427a2fdca9aa3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_019e37742d1fc844101875cd32f66076" parent="aspace_5f54ff6c463ac2d289c427a2fdca9aa3" type="folder">2014-0066</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6dead9825770ff177f068b68b6057fce"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science <lb/>Abstract: Continuous Elections are the election methods of governing systems that do not have set term lengths or election cycles, but rather employ a fluid voting system where individuals may cast, retract, or change their vote at will and, consequently, potentially cause a new outcome at any time. We offer the first, rudimentary computer models of this method, which predict a generally stable outcome for most organizations. We engage in what is thus far the most comprehensive discussion concerning the theoretical underpinnings of this method, as well as, its potential merits and shortcomings. Finally, we offer an open-source program and framework for this election method that can be freely downloaded and employed in the interest of providing future scholars with data so that we might further our understanding of this unique election method.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Constituencies</subject><subject source="lcsh">Accountability</subject><subject source="lcsh">Political representation</subject><subject source="lcsh">Democracy</subject><subject source="lcsh">Elections</subject><subject source="lcsh">Voting</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref103_w7z" level="file"><did><unittitle>Csillag, Tamas. <emph render="italic">Intertwining powers: The Case Study of Hungary's Declining Separation of Powers</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0096</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_42aff343ee2310724dd277efe818a2c4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_be67b0aec682c6e82836d3e1e5b6bc9e" parent="aspace_42aff343ee2310724dd277efe818a2c4" type="folder">2014-0096</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e97a517b964b731770f1f7c235cac16a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science <lb/>Abstract: In 1989 a peaceful revolution swept away the Soviet-style socialism in Hungary the foundations of the modern, democratic Hungarian nation state were established. Although in the '90's the Hungarian Republic was built upon the ancient concept of the Separation of Powers, now, merely two decades later, this model seems to be deteriorating. Many blame the 2010 Parliamentary elections that concluded in the landslide victory of the conservative right-wing party, Fidesz, and their consecutive Constitutional reforms for this deterioration. Furthermore, there is a number of other, often less obvious changes in the state structure that redistributed power from the executive and judiciary branches to the Parliament and thus allowed uncontested governance for Fidesz. In this paper I intend to investigate the state of the Hungarian Separation of Powers model to determine the extent to which the legislature has usurped powers formerly reserved to the other branches. This analysis may also have implications for other young and transitional democracies (anocracies) around the world.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><title source="local">Veto Players</title><subject source="lcsh">Electoral systems</subject><subject source="lcsh">Separation of powers</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Hungary</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Democracy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref84_frb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gellai, Daniel. <emph render="italic">Roma Race: The Racialization of Roma Identity in Hungary</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0070</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_a36b3ff62ee777012bb62019f8e0bb92" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_793075fcae32489b281f70877d2e6ddb" parent="aspace_a36b3ff62ee777012bb62019f8e0bb92" type="folder">2014-0070</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_80e6216cae03592947c87b5628eb1338"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science, Middle Eastern Studies <lb/>Abstract: This paper examines how racial identity is constructed by analyzing the legal framework that the Hungarian State devised for Roma affairs in the last decades. The examination of how the Hungarian legal system shapes and constructs Roma identity reveals how national and ethnic identities are part of "classificatory struggles" and what consequences those struggles can incur. Even though State laws and the legal framework do not explicitly mention racial categories, they do set the Roma apart from the majority and only a minority of them can perform the identity that the state assigns. The need to identify them can thus perpetuate other markers, e.g. racial features, for which there is historical precedence and empiric evidence.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Roma (People)</subject><subject source="local">Legal systems</subject><subject source="lcsh">Minorities</subject><subject source="lcsh">Race</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref100_qmp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Karaulova, Daria. <emph render="italic">The Impact of Civil War Violence on The Education System in Nepal</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0071</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_8f915595be5205e8e58963b8a20bb43b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_b42feb6644bcc69e92ce8be6481d6504" parent="aspace_8f915595be5205e8e58963b8a20bb43b" type="folder">2014-0071</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_77fb4a6aa31c6d9bebaf65931e392b29"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science <lb/>Abstract: Nepal suffered civil war violence over the course of ten years, from 1996 to 2006.

The research presents two approaches: empirical analysis and qualitative research findings. I conclude that the violence caused by the Maoist insurgency had a significant impact on public and private school enrolment and educational processes, which potentially facilitated the increase of the number of private schools in post-conflict Nepal.

This paper seeks to explore some of the ways that a country's wealth influences its likelihood of providing peacekeepers. I theorize that the UN's fixed monthly payment per soldier provides more incentive to developing countries to supply troops, than it does to developed countries. Therefore, I look at the relationship between a country's wealth, the interaction of wealth and military capacity, and the interaction of wealth and proximity to a conflict on the country's peacekeeping supply. I find that wealth in itself is a poor predictor for supplying peacekeepers. However, the interaction between wealth and military capacity is a good predictor: Poorer countries show an increase in troops supplied with an increased defense budget, while there for richer countries is no effect. Lastly, rich countries in unstable regions seem to be less willing to supply troops than rich countries in stable regions. I conclude that the UN's fixed monthly payment induces poorer countries to contribute more troops than their richer counterparts.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">National income</subject><subject source="lcsh">Security policy, National</subject><subject source="lcsh">International relations</subject><subject source="lcsh">Peacekeeping forces</subject><subject source="lcsh">United Nations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref108_ph0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Underwood, Stephen Ross. <emph render="italic">Don't You Forget About Me: A Rational Choice Model of Presidential Legacy</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0093</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_febec481227f7f9db18eec320d31af28" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_16ea596426c637f54de274b9e62660a0" parent="aspace_febec481227f7f9db18eec320d31af28" type="folder">2014-0093</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3c5a6db18bb43a7cc5d877c93c25873d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science <lb/>Abstract: Presidential legacy has been studied for the last 50 years with no framework, model, or theory in which legacy is broadly understood and conceptualized. Research has focused on finding macro determinants of constructed lists of the "Greatest Presidents". Rather than continue in this vein, I offer a simple model with which Presidential legacy can be studied. I then apply rational choice theory to this model to produce a framework by which I characterize the interaction that forms legacy. This model implies a relationship between the net effects of former Presidents on present utility and retrospective presidential approval. I test this relationship empirically using a novel responsibility assignment measure. The results indicate that the net effect of former Presidents on utility can be understood in terms of this responsibility assignment and, more importantly, that this proves significant in the prediction of retrospective approval.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Public opinion</subject><subject source="lcsh">Responsibility</subject><subject source="lcsh">Rational choice theory</subject><subject source="lcsh">Presidents</subject><subject source="lcsh">Political Leadership</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref105_ks2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wu, Xiaomei. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Euro on European Domestic Politics during Economic Recessions</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0101</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_2a5ddc7b6174c8cd4124c24a178b5de3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_2f343572c74cf0c320d6e81d1ca38f9d" parent="aspace_2a5ddc7b6174c8cd4124c24a178b5de3" type="folder">2014-0101</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f1f7d2df2b979e100fc82671278297e5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science <lb/>Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between the adoption of the currency of Euro and people's satisfactions towards domestic governments in Europe when the 2009 Eurozone economic recession happened. When the economic recessions happen, it is possible that the people from Eurozone countries are more likely than the people outside of the Eurozone to attribute the economic failure to European Central Bank (ECB) instead of their domestic governments because their national governments do not have direct control over the regional monetary policy. However, this paper shows that such leniency in fact did not exist when the 2009 Eurozone economic recession happened. In other words, the public does not accept a membership of the Eurozone as a legit excuse of a national economic recession. Furthermore, the paper has found that in fact there is a negative association between the use of Euro and the public satisfaction towards the national government after the financial crisis broke up.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Politics</subject><subject source="lcsh">Recessions</subject><subject source="lcsh">Euro</subject><subject source="lcsh">European Union</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref276_f93" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dickson, John. <emph render="italic">Capture the Flag: How Flag Exposure Affects Social Value Orientation and Nationalism</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0051</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_38a0d9af1f5ea2b2cd91088af887eb82" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_39bd5d67147c64f567c0580f0e4e48a8" parent="aspace_38a0d9af1f5ea2b2cd91088af887eb82" type="folder">2015-0051</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f8aa6557a12eaff0f81d628361e46b22"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science<lb/>Abstract: This study examines the effects of exposure to national flags on individual social value orientations and levels of nationalism. An experiment is put forth which primes individuals with a flag of their home country and then tests to see if this prime affects participants' behavior and motivations. Empirical evidence shows that exposure to one's national flag significantly reduces one's social value orientation, with the individual acting far less altruistically. There is also considerable evidence that there exists a placebo effect for how group symbols can influence social value orientation.  This study also finds that flag exposure does not have a statistically significant effect on nationalism. These results are explained in the context of Social Identity Theory, with the further conclusion that more research on this topic needs to be conducted.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Nationalism</subject><subject source="lcsh">Social identity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Social values</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref302_qge" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hu, Yuanmo. <emph render="italic">A Kantian Account of the "War on Terror"</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0059</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_18a8320b34a7a55f4bacb2556f8623d8" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_8fc50f013312152f51d6f44a1ca93fa3" parent="aspace_18a8320b34a7a55f4bacb2556f8623d8" type="folder">2015-0059</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_01420e8447e5ab21a97319c98da6b043"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science, Philosophy<lb/>Abstract: The September 11 terrorist attack on the United States of America gave birth to the term "war on terror."

This paper then offers a moral judgment of this war applying the ethical theory of Immanuel Kant, by putting terrorism, the means and methods of the war, and the legitimacy of revenge under the microscope of the Categorical Imperative.

The theory suggests that leaders who require a larger minimum number /proportion of people to keep power, provide more public goods. Using sub-national variation in Kenya, this study utilises the methodologies of Jensen (2009), Bueno de Mesquita and Smith (2009), and Chhibber and Nooruddin (2004), to test the arguments posited by Selectorate Theory with respect to Public Good Provision. These methodologies are compared against Electricity Provision, Healthcare Provision, Education Provision, and forms of Local Government Expenditure. This theory is contrasted against the other theoretical and empirically tested explanations in the variation of public good provision, namely the importance of ethnicity. The findings of the first two major tests do not corroborate the theory's predictions, pointing to corruption and an absence of accountability allowing public agents to treat nominally public goods as functionally private ones. The findings of the third major test indicate that selectorate logic generally applies, but fails if there are homogenous preferences amongst parties on the provision of highly visible public goods, indicating that 'politics' do matter.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Politics</subject><subject source="lcsh">Public institutions</subject><subject source="lcsh">Public goods</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Kenya</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Elections</subject><subject source="local">Selectorate theory</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref274_vsh" level="file"><did><unittitle>McDougall, Rory Morton. <emph render="italic">Examining Voting Patterns in Lebanon: Why the March 8th and March 14th Alliances Matter, Not Religion</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0057</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_cd1a7f1e7e82a35a6f73054e21f4e846" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_3c8ceb4d3f3c656084e14a0c7745b889" parent="aspace_cd1a7f1e7e82a35a6f73054e21f4e846" type="folder">2015-0057</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a1f4762bc4da780419278d094e9667e3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science<lb/>Abstract: Despite the Lebanese Parliament extending its term for a further three years until 2017 due to political conflicts and instability, Lebanon is one of the few democratic countries in the Middle East. It is also one of the most religiously diverse countries in the world and this diversity is reflected in the number of Lebanese political parties, which are often aligned under religious banners. It has been very difficult to examine the impact of religion on voting in Lebanon though due to limited government data and the limitations of survey data. However, the election results from the 2009 election offer a new perspective into Lebanese voting patterns. Using a homogeneous precinct model, the election results show that voters do not vote along religious lines and instead the allegiance to an alliance – either the March 8th or the March 14th alliance – is critical in determining voting with the exception of the Shia community. Furthermore, Lebanese voters are polarised within their religious communities with the vote often split between the two alliances.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Religion</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Lebanon</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Elections</subject><subject source="lcsh">Ethnicity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Coalitions</subject><subject source="lcsh">Voting</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref460_4cu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ha, Bora. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Foreign Aid and Natural Disasters on Civil Violence: Comparison of Cross-national Findings and the Case of Aceh, Indonesia.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0050</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4f43a414c59bef32f9db5a4e1306cf74">In conflict regions, the role of foreign aid and the occurrence of natural disasters may have significant effect on the outcome of violent incidents.

Using cross-national data, I first provide evidence that countries with greater gender parity have higher scores of happiness and life satisfaction, even after controlling for income and health. I then focus on the case of the UAE, where the government has actively promoted gender equality and economic opportunities for women. I use a survey experiment of approximately 400 Emirati nationals to explore how the promotion of gender parity affects each gender. Specifically, I try to understand whether increased happiness of women due to the promotion gender rights is countered by declining satisfaction of Emirati males. My survey includes several treatments of hypothetical situations to answer this question. I find that promoting female happiness raises overall happiness, as male happiness does not decline equivalently. Due to the prevalence of strong conservative gender norms in the UAE, I investigate some implications of the government's promotion of gender equality. My findings demonstrate that because Emirati women have equal opportunities in the UAE's development, this empowers them and allows them to reach their full potential, thus allowing them to be happier.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_64822c51579213cc2d10d31316599b52" level="file"><did><unittitle>Asifa, Charlotte. <emph render="italic">The determinants of domestic and sexual violence: Evidence from the Congo </emph> </unittitle><unitid>2018-0145</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_40c91dbadeaf8de4c30c3c9647d5f249" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_8639adb5dcd47472c0554b8147f9b8b2" parent="aspace_40c91dbadeaf8de4c30c3c9647d5f249" type="folder">2018-0145</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2b8eb56fd987617b2ff5818d17486039"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>What are the determinants of sexual and domestic violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo?

Using the list experiment that uniquely controls for the sensitive nature of domestic and sexual violence, I attained the portion of the population that experiences sexual and domestic violence. I use the t-test statistical method to estimate the determinants. The results showed that approximately 33.3% of the population experience sexual violence and 24.8% of the population experience domestic violence. The strongest positive determinant of sexual violence was female productivity and conflict associated with pillaging and the presence of armed groups. The strongest positive determinant for domestic violence was conflict associated with the presence of armed groups.

The comparative study attempts to examine the extent to which giving voters information about the majority distribution impacts their preferences differently in the two contexts. This goal is accomplished by applying empirical findings on what motivates bandwagon voting, other-regarding preferences and psychological factors to the experimental analysis of the two treatments. The comparative study of the treatments shows that voters engage in bandwagon voting more frequently during the candidate elections treatment. The fact that both psychological factors and other-regarding preferences affect voters in the context of candidate elections explains the higher levels of bandwagon voting manifestation in the treatment.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_50d7d0e2d7a1a32bae00b6fe082e6adc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Braunsteiner, Aron. <emph render="italic">'Toking' Initiative: The Role of Ballot Initiatives in the Policy Diffusion of Medical Marijuana Laws</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0106</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_5eefb6f573e5e6131eff635a70b4b990" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_e2f075fccf37dd1a6eeb22bfefb20251" parent="aspace_5eefb6f573e5e6131eff635a70b4b990" type="folder">2018-0106</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fbcb3c08d9aef8d99bec95ef261f220c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Medical Marijuana Laws (MMLs) have been spreading in the United States for over 20 years. There are currently 29 states that have adopted a MML. What were the factors that led to the spread of this policy? When California legalised Medical Marijuana it was through Proposition 215 in 1996, a ballot initiative. This paper investigates the role ballot initiatives have played in the further adoption and diffusion of MMLs using event history analysis of MML adoptions between 1996 and 2012. I find that the presence of ballot initiatives increases the likelihood of adoption for moderate states with medium scores of liberal citizen ideology by as much as 10. I propose the mechanism that policy entrepreneurs bypass their legislatures, which are reluctant to pass MMLs unless they are very liberal, through ballot initiatives. I also find that the role of ballot initiatives has been decreasing over time, adding to the theory about their importance in the initial innovation process. I propose that as the positive policy outcomes of MMLs become more apparent establishment pressure against them fades and more states start adopting them, the role of entrepreneurship, and therefore ballot initiatives decrease and give way to other modes of diffusion.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e2aec7e11adfe77cc14c713b7a173651" level="file"><did><unittitle>Headley, Tyler. <emph render="italic">The Politics of Health</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0161</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_9e254bbabab22f040118c54260083ff1" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_87502cce585a383db0a3b69b74d961f1" parent="aspace_9e254bbabab22f040118c54260083ff1" type="folder">2018-0161</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c1076fff7ea6f9803228b9b5d234264a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Societal inequalities create a health gradient wherein the richer and more powerful have better health outcomes, such as higher life expectancies and lower child mortality rates, than the poorer and less powerful.

Second, I present three co-authored articles that serve as the core of my Capstone. The first article is a novel exploratory study on the economic costs associated with dengue illness episodes in international travelers.

Through an analysis of electoral support for the Front National based on the results of the latest French presidential elections (May 2017), this paper aims to determine which factors influence the likelihood of supporting the Front National at the commune level. We test three different hypotheses regarding key variables which have been singled out by the existing literature as main drivers of the Front National vote; namely the presence of immigrants (Immigration), the Unemployment rate (Unemployment), the completion of a higher education degree (Higher Education) and the level of inequality (Inequality). We find that high levels of Higher Education, as well as low Unemployment, are associated with lower levels of support for the Front National; while high levels of Inequality and low levels of income both correlate with an increased Level of Support for the Front National. This paper also uncovers unexpected and negatively correlated relationships between the Level of Support for the Front National and both Age and Immigration. Moreover, the introduction of Change in Immigration overtime as a variable also reveals interesting correlations with the Level of Support for the Front National.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_966f6e178577fc36dae66ef78e728799" level="file"><did><unittitle>Igono, Victor. <emph render="italic">Regime type and National Health Policies: A Study of National Healthcare Expenditures in Sub-Saharan African Countries</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0140</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_4ec042d7584a39e540424aa954edf86d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_33102f287828b3ed4b159941ab9bd579" parent="aspace_4ec042d7584a39e540424aa954edf86d" type="folder">2018-0140</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1491fc8c98d42a8256656f1a071da191"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Does regime type influence health policies in sub-Saharan African countries? Are democratic governments likely to spend more on the health and wellbeing of their population vis-à-vis non-democracies? This paper seeks to answer the above questions by studying healthcare expenditure patterns among governments of sub-Saharan African countries. It combines a quantitative analysis of expenditure patterns among 44 African countries with an in-depth case study on two countries. The paper finds support for the positive effect of democratic polity on increased healthcare expenditure. Thus it argues that democracies dedicate a greater amount of resources to the healthcare of their populace vis-à-vis non-democracies. This is because democratic leaders have a greater incentive to provide public goods to a large section of the population in order to gain or maintain political power in the face of frequent challenge in a free and fair electoral system.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_bc97e47412b005f6e7cc522f5e75d740" level="file"><did><unittitle> Jo, Hyun Woo. <emph render="italic">Political Regionalism in South Korea: An Empirical Analysis</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0137</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_ee9a492e22cca30bc2d47fdbbbe45e3c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_2b64dd790e41849fe5cd333b412ff54e" parent="aspace_ee9a492e22cca30bc2d47fdbbbe45e3c" type="folder">2018-0137</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e2d81704190bd19937d0d648f3461dbc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Previous studies on political regionalism in South Korea have pointed to the economic disparity between Yeongnam and Honam regions as a core reason. I use municipality level data on past presidential election results and GRDP per capita to further explore the relationship between the two. Analysis of GRDP per capita at the provincial level shows that the economic gap between Yeongnam and Honam has been closing over the past 30 years. However, using multiple regression analysis, I find that political regionalism is still persistent. Effects of neither GRDP per capita nor average age in Yeongnam and Honam are sufficient to offset the strong effects of region in the four most recent elections.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2a8aadd3c33f6479d1504bd83ec8f888" level="file"><did><unittitle>Khan, Tauqir. <emph render="italic">The Relationship Between Human Wellbeing and Firearm Related Violence in the United States of America</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0162</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_b86dabee758a4c4f1a3702020381f8ad" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_4671c02aeb8768ced39212ad68d9d1ba" parent="aspace_b86dabee758a4c4f1a3702020381f8ad" type="folder">2018-0162</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_de2763a87f086532978c109103802a10"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper explores the relationship between human well-being and gun violence in the United States of America. I analyze if states with higher scores on the Human Development Index (HDI), an indicator that looks beyond a measure of simple GDP, are associated with lower rates of firearm related deaths. This is primarily to add scope to the bulk of cross-national literature that traditionally limits focus to factors such as gun ownership and mental health, and contribute to the literature connecting Health, Education and Income to crime and suicide. I find that when state-fixed and year-fixed effects are controlled, the relationship between HDI and Firearm Related Deaths becomes insignificant. Despite this, the Education Index of HDI maintains a negative relationship with Firearm Related Deaths when tested individually. As such, my findings suggest that focusing government policy on improving Education Index of a state may have positive implications on gun violence. My results also show that when controlling for HDI and Law Enforcement Officer rates, the Strength of Firearm Legislation has the strongest negative relationship with Firearm Related Deaths.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_caeefdf5a6e4650815f423afca294296" level="file"><did><unittitle>Klinar, Stjepan. <emph render="italic">The Sectoral Effects of Brexit on the US Economy: Early Evidence from the Stock Market Reaction to the Brexit Vote</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0163</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_4375d62557f3a0de54bf226238e6ac3f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_44d030b5ebd1acd430b2a25b7baa8c06" parent="aspace_4375d62557f3a0de54bf226238e6ac3f" type="folder">2018-0163</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e2865c115fa5b402e159954556d13c73"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper explores the impact of the Brexit vote on publicly traded firms grouped by sectors.

Using the market model event study methodology, I assess the effects of Brexit on stock market prices in the US stock market, relative to what had been anticipated as measured by abnormal returns (ARs). The results found no significant effect on the stock market as a whole. However, I observe significant heterogeneity of impact across sectors. Five sectors appear to be affected in particular. Utilities and Healthcare sectors experienced positive abnormal returns, while the Automobile, Business Equipment, and Banking sectors experienced negative abnormal returns. The positive abnormal returns observed in the Utilities and Healthcare sectors persist after 7 trading days; on the contrary, negative abnormal returns persist only in the Business Equipment sector. These findings indicate that Brexit had a mixed effect on the US stock market with apparent sector-by-sector differences.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_25f671066c3af9552b688fec5dddea41" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lino, Rafael. <emph render="italic">The Effects of Environmental Grievances on Legislative Elections in Brazil </emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0152</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_544b09d96874ce47691583922c90ba6e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_b207c311adb1afad29387f7ac96856e0" parent="aspace_544b09d96874ce47691583922c90ba6e" type="folder">2018-0152</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_795631850a9ea9a383cf5575dce57ab0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper explores the relationship between deforestation in municipalities of the Brazilian Legal Amazon, and voting preferences.

I find that contrary to my hypothesis, increased deforestation is instead positively correlated to increased vote share for right wing parties, and I provide two possible explanations: Amazon residents rank economic incentives higher than environmental grievances; or that deforestation-related industries' lobbying favours right wing parties.

I capitalize on the unique Nationally Determined Contributions to find evidence on whether the regime type of a country affects different measures of its policies presented for the Paris Agreement of 2015. I look at four measures in the Nationally Determined Contributions, namely policy type, unconditional and conditional emission reduction targets, and aggregate adaptation targets. My results reveal that policy type is largely unaffected by regime type. There is evidence that democracies in the high income quartiles have higher unconditional and conditional emission reduction targets than autocracies and anocracies. Furthermore for aggregate adaptation policies levels of corruption turn out to be a key driver, where less corrupt countries have lower aggregate adaptation policies. I infer that policy type reflects the Common But Differentiated Responsibilities principle of international law. Democracies, facing double audience costs, commit to higher tangible and monitorable targets, such as emission reduction targets. However, since aggregate adaptation policies do not lend themselves to clear monitorable mechanisms, they are used by more corrupt countries to compensate for expected international audience costs.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6abed4fefc38822098cbe169cf9e4eb2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Murphy, Kelly. <emph render="italic">The Legacy of Involuntary Resettlement on Political Behaviors: Evidence from Kenya</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0155</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_e3cadcdd2db744d1f95e57f9bb181b1a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_433c8d1d41c1391f164cde6d19ee9142" parent="aspace_e3cadcdd2db744d1f95e57f9bb181b1a" type="folder">2018-0155</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b77ff45c0a3fad2146de79f1b8cf9a02"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Involuntary resettlement affects millions of people around the world, from those displaced by natural disaster or development projects to those fleeing economic distress or conflict.

In this paper, I contribute to the growing literature by studying the nature of distributive politics and how it plays out along the lines of public educational resources. I posit the question of how and when educational resources are incorporated into the strategy of distributive politics to achieve electoral gains. I look at this question by referring to the case study of Hungary. Using datasets from the Hungarian Ministry of Education and National Election council and implementing a Regression Discontinuity Design, I argue that the recent financial centralization of the public educational system made education more susceptible to political manipulation through allowing the channeling of funds to schools in swing areas to gain electoral support. I find some evidence that the manipulation of educational resources by the central government is present after the centralization in Hungary. However, this pattern is only present in the case of the number of teachers available, and not economic indicators, such as the number of computers or building quality.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_cb6663a4d36f5149b66069824bc8b817" level="file"><did><unittitle>Roopra, Simrat K. <emph render="italic">Conflict, Modernization, and Perceptions of Traditional Leadership: Evidence from the Democratic Republic of Congo</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0114</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_571f6e23682f9e3a54f1a03dd24351fb" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0374d667313bb709ffd2ac2df09ca44a" parent="aspace_571f6e23682f9e3a54f1a03dd24351fb" type="folder">2018-0114</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6a1630d151d6f762d3212163bcc2158e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This research seeks to understand how traditional-governance institutions are perceived by rural constituents during a time when conflict is dynamic and when modernization is on the rise. In places to where the modern state struggles to project power, are chiefs still seen as legitimate in light of these social phenomena? This is a gap in the literature that the current study aims to fill by exploring the effects of conflict and modernization on perceptions of traditional leaders in the DRC. This study uses cross-sectional data to conduct regression analyses to understand how conflict and modernization influence villagers' perceptions of a chief's legitimacy, specifically his competency, representativeness, and trustworthiness. The data used was collected between 2010 to 2012 from 816 villages in four eastern DRC provinces. Results from regression analyses suggest that chief trustworthiness is negatively affected by conflict and modernization, competency is unaffected, and representativeness is negatively affected by modernization. These results indicate that in response to evolving social conditions, traditional leaders are still seen as legitimate in certain respects. This suggests that chiefs are still a viable governing unit and that efforts should be made to strengthen the institution by improving the chief's representativeness and trustworthiness.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_285f7b0c504338ab4e9abf82fc5f8a3e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Almarzooqi, Omar. <emph render="italic">Understanding the Successes and Failures of Regional Blocs: The Power of Institutions</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0203</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_47300a209b6b22d518d87fedb7d729a7" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_dacc83f2bde662a4c9d0bf5ba886dc4c" parent="aspace_47300a209b6b22d518d87fedb7d729a7" type="folder">2019-0203</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_47c00d604416c48c066e65f89a39de87"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The paper attempts to address the mechanisms by which regional blocs fail or succeed.

Member exit clauses are shown to have no significant effect on bloc performance, having a court or alternative arbitration system can if given legitimacy and voting rules have a large effect, with unanimous being the least effective and mixed being the most.

For the purpose of this research, I will be looking primarily at the effects of precolonial political centralisation levels on coethnic voting for a presidential candidate. My secondary variable of study will be levels of education. Linking together literature and data on precolonial centralisation in Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda, and individual levels of education, I find a strong positive association between my centralisation variable and coethnic voting. The long-run effects of precolonial institutions, however, do not appear to be driven by clientelist relationships of trust toward a traditional leader or belief that a leader should help his own community. Some evidence, however, shows that this relationship could be driven by norms of respect towards authority. An interaction between my centralisation and education variables overall shows that centralisation matters more than education though these differences are small.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ba28d9356b00efc5c5cbe2738a5b03ca" level="file"><did><unittitle>Estes, Jocilyn. <emph render="italic">Confucius Institutes in the United States: Crouching Tiger or Hidden Dragon?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0141</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_2054ef13f9653b67272e3db2578c55b2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_50e53b4f06d310aa5c2c9ac5ea66182e" parent="aspace_2054ef13f9653b67272e3db2578c55b2" type="folder">2019-0141</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ca831820819eb9c9444f83b818f5fb27"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>World powers tend to export their ideals and agendas to mold the international status quo. The soft power methods that China utilizes to establish influence in other countries align with the idea of its peaceful rise. One instrument of this soft power strategy is the Confucius Institute program. These institutes are cultural and language centers at universities around the world, run and subsidized by the Chinese government. Research has suggested that increasing investment in public diplomacy programming through Confucius Institutes represents an attempt at establishing influence overseas in a non-confrontational manner. Others maintain that institutes constitute a national security threat by targeting universities that conduct dual-use research. This study examines a novel dataset of over 2,000 university-level observations including both Confucius Institute host and non-host institutions in the U.S. It finds that universities with large Science and research programs, and large enrollments are more likely to host institutes. As the first empirical research aimed at assessing the strategy behind Confucius Institutes in the U.S., this project acts as a preliminary examination of an ascendant power's informal diplomatic activities with citizens of a rival.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_61b2b0866ca4577b386584e0bad4bdcf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ismail, Donia. <emph render="italic">Political Changes and Piety: Religion as Public Discourse in Urban Egypt</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0177</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_4ecc09f7ee5362de32b9ea9e17b9aff1" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_fcd35450aca6914186d93ebe96158c64" parent="aspace_4ecc09f7ee5362de32b9ea9e17b9aff1" type="folder">2019-0177</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e12b77bfc2639130cd925d898b153362"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In the Arab Middle East, the prevailing assumption is that religion shapes politics. Questions relating to the capacity of political changes to trigger various religious sentiments are often overlooked. This is especially true within Political Science scholarship. Through this project, I aim to answer one fundamental question: what are the effects of political shocks on religiosity amongst urban Egyptians? Observing this relationship in the specific context of Egypt allows me to interrogate the fluidity of the boundary between religion and politics. The events of the Iranian Revolution, the first Gulf War, the Invasion of Iraq, the Arab Spring and the Coup d'état represent the political shocks of interest. I then test for the effects of these shocks in relation to an observable element of religiosity: the figure of the veiled woman. By examining the veiling trends collected on one popular women's magazine, this capstone contributes to the construction of a time-series on the evolution of religiosity. Despite the absence of statistical significance for some findings, the overall study demonstrates evidence that counter the linear narrative attached to religiosity in Egypt.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9bdeafd96491aee2899a73fd4fbfc1c6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Johnston, Maria Caeli. <emph render="italic">Political Engagement in Europe: What Groups of Voters are More Interested in Politics and Inclined to Trust Politicians?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0178</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_c1ef38efc410603ea562ee8349ef23ac" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0b511226e062c2813bec51d47f023ed2" parent="aspace_c1ef38efc410603ea562ee8349ef23ac" type="folder">2019-0178</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7d09302495dc6b12f9076143bc83b0bc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper looks at groups of voters that are more interested in politics and trusting towards politicians based on their domicile and educational attainment. Precisely, the paper offers literature overview that argued that interest in politics and political trust are important in determining the levels of political participation and, in the context of a current political movement, the effects of populism. The study uses these two variables - interest and trust - along with recent studies of voting behavior, to determine which groups of voters are likely to be participating in elections and effectively targeted by populist leaders. Regression analysis of the survey data from the European Social Survey offers following interpretation: people from rural areas are less likely to be interested in politics, and less likely to report trust in politicians. There is a positive relationship between the level of educational attainment and interest in politics, as well as between education level and trust in politicians. In conclusion, the paper suggests that when discussing determinants behind voting behavior that favors populism, it is important to consider what makes people more interested in politics and trusting towards politicians. Understanding voters' preferences and what political movements resonate with different voting groups, sparking their interest and trust is key to a successful political movement.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_30a524f0d0cc61f18855b67b717606c6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Karasira, Faustine. <emph render="italic">The effect of Performance contracts on Maternal and Child health services in Rwanda</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0192</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_096b2f9df5509111c2bff31e4f189ac5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_55a45fc9be2aa3e15280abe9c7b35eac" parent="aspace_096b2f9df5509111c2bff31e4f189ac5" type="folder">2019-0192</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d6ee22a5a6551ac43af0f39f47744c7a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper examines the effect of performance contracts (Imihigo) on health services in Rwanda.

Concurrently, this paper reveals that Estonians systematically use i-voting more compared to non-Estonians, however, rural communities in Estonia do not utilize i-voting as expected and stated in the hypothesis. This study calls for further research in i-voting mechanism as it appears to benefit certain groups, and thus yields mixed results.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_39906961869ebc5bc8183fcc0597fbfb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Madataly, Ifran. <emph render="italic">How did the 2015 Nigerian elections affect ethnic identification in Nigeria?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0163</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_a72ea8afb74ccb5a0a70925f65cbfb0e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_693c3fd39b0721cf48406d85c9dc6797" parent="aspace_a72ea8afb74ccb5a0a70925f65cbfb0e" type="folder">2019-0163</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_26fec37b2e9b0675181f8fe703e4bfca"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Election periods have been strongly correlated to high ethnic identification in empirical analyses (Posner, Eifert, Miguel 2010). The 2015 Nigerian elections does not conform to theories from previous studies. The shift in voter preference between the 2011 and 2015 national elections could be explained by a shift from ethnic attachment towards national identification. Therefore, in this paper we explore the rise of national identification as an explanation to the fall in ethnic attachment. Firstly, we reexamine the role of elections, measured by its proximity and competitiveness on ethnic identification. Secondly, we assess the amplification of national identification by looking at the extent citizens positively perceive their country. Lastly, we evaluate the role of the media in reducing ethnic attachment. We find that the rise in national identification leads to the fall in ethnic identification. The increased access to news from the media improves citizens' political knowledge which stimulates the reduction of ethnic political preference and furthermore ethnic identification. These results contradict previous research and justifies the reasons why Nigerians did not identify to their ethnic identities in periods approaching the 2015 elections.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8e835d24c100f60d5880d9aeeedddf6e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mao, Xinyi. <emph render="italic">Examining the incentives of joining the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0155</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_66133426f19683f6a7aa08cfc267c71f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_1ba47e0849399d901b444a7d36ba13da" parent="aspace_66133426f19683f6a7aa08cfc267c71f" type="folder">2019-0155</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d5305d698536418976d5da4c376c40ee"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a multilateral cooperation framework proposed by China in 2013 to further economic, political and cultural exchanges. This paper explores the incentivizing and deterring factors that influence a country's decision to join the Belt and Road Initiative. Economic dependence in the form of reliance on foreign military aid, investments, and trade are found to increase political compliance to dominant countries' preferences. Voting patterns in the United Nations General Assembly are also found to be correlates of previous foreign aid and investments.   Analyzing project-level Chinese foreign direct investment data prior to the BRI's inception, I find that Chinese investments motivate BRI joining when they are heavily concentrated in extractive sectors, but delay BRI joining when the sectors are less extractive, suggesting the importance of sector-specific and project-level approach to studying the BRI. Although not significant, I also find that American air force aid contributes the most to deterring BRI joining. However, regressions run on average data of the years preceding countries' decisions to join the BRI do not find a similar effect.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4f065c08c1006898a4ba7f773dde2186" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mariano, Kirk. <emph render="italic">An Analysis of China's Emerging Influence on the ASEAN Geopolitics</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0133</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_52121130dbb8995a81e669de150a4824" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_7ef30f179cff8e18cee3442aa249a1c4" parent="aspace_52121130dbb8995a81e669de150a4824" type="folder">2019-0133</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d9a1cb46e80675838359b52ec8488295"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Foreign direct investment and foreign aid have always been used by social scientists as influential determinants of other economic factors, or has been influenced by economic and political factors.

In this study, as I tried to analyze the emerging influence of China in the ASEAN geopolitics using the aforementioned variables, I attempted to explore the status quo using the case of China, the ASEAN, and the US. I have found that the influx of Chinese foreign direct investment and foreign aid into the ASEAN member countries are not viable determinants of the ASEAN countries' UN General Assembly voting agreement with China or voting disagreement with the US contrary to the suggested status quo.

Previous scholarship suggests that these jarring events may decrease the popularity of those in power and rally support for leaders advocating for compensation, as opposed to preparedness spending. By examining the past decade of rainfall and voting records at over 8,000 polling stations across Australia, this study investigates how voters from drought affected and unaffected locations have comparatively voted in the Australian federal elections. As the first piece of research that tackles the impacts of drought on elections in Australia, it serves as a case study to understand how the lived experience of climate variability may have political ramifications. Results suggest that those affected by drought tend to support parties advocating for disaster relief rather than parties aiming to enhance water management, particularly in rural areas. This could sway election outcomes towards representatives focused on retrospective drought compensation and, in turn, exacerbate the likelihood of future water shortages in Australia. More broadly, if those at the front-lines of climate impacts prioritize the short term, the onset of climate events could fail to signal democracies towards taking actions necessary to manage future climate disasters.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c22123d05762ff78acf73a88ab562d35" level="file"><did><unittitle>Oh, Sally. <emph render="italic">How Attitudes towards Co-Ethnic Groups Are (Not) Affected by Identity Salience and Information Correction Mechanisms: Evidence from South Korea </emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0162</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_5ae03ffeb274cdaa759456020eb7b5c4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_891d3ee49b11e0e3edb867c1a1b4ad65" parent="aspace_5ae03ffeb274cdaa759456020eb7b5c4" type="folder">2019-0162</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bb8751b0a1ec9189bf10a28bd66bfa83"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Can present bias against co-ethnic groups be changed for the better through reminders of shared identity and corrections of information?

I highlight the relationship between the ruling parties in the parliament and state resources allocation in the context of a newly established democracy - Ukraine. I analyze two measures of the sub-national allocations of discretionary grants: at the electoral district and oblast levels. The findings suggest that the effect of coalition on subventions is positive and significant. Additionally, the president's party allocates more subventions than other parties in the parliament, but it does not have an independent effect from being in a coalition. The findings for political business cycles theory are mixed: there is a positive effect in allocations of subventions across all parties, however, the relationship between the coalition and subventions in the election year does not appear to be statistically significant.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_96f1e7c0cf5e2127040df8b31f201ea3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Salazar, Miren Aguirre. <emph render="italic">To Pay or NATO Pay</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0200</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_499873774a42f6dc8ea2061e0c04e899" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_91ddb82c271224bf9a16f08078823102" parent="aspace_499873774a42f6dc8ea2061e0c04e899" type="folder">2019-0200</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c31ad1e6fb1ede75eb8537ba8af1d6e7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Previous studies on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation have focused on finding theoretical and qualitative explanations to the imbalanced contributions, lacking a counterfactual for how much countries would dedicate to defence expenditure, should the alliance not exist.

The question I will seek to answer in this study is: What role does gender play in sensitive interviews in Central Africa? Using data from a randomized survey conducted in the DRC, I ﬁnd that respondents tend to indicate more support for gender equality to female interviewers than male interviewers. However, women are generally less likely to receive responses that report occurrences of gender-based violence than men. Pairing a respondent with an interviewer of the same gender has little to no eﬀect. My results support a causal link between survey responses and interviewer gender. I suggest that cultural context is a key component in understanding gender eﬀects on survey design. My ﬁndings have practical implications for producers and consumers of survey data from Central Africa and underscore the importance of considering cultural context when designing in-person surveys.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_9f34534425d42ee50133f348e97e554a" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Social Research and Public Policy</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref97_hvz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Blacklock, Alistair Douglas. <emph render="italic">Scared Straight: Stigma, stress and sexual diversity in U.S. high schools</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0064</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_f26f8a81e2528f0e2b594ed0ea56555b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_eaf2970973018d31c646943d3fdb1f91" parent="aspace_f26f8a81e2528f0e2b594ed0ea56555b" type="folder">2014-0064</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_16089b22420e72e93f3b88952676420f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: Adopting minority stress theory and stigma management theory for sexual minority youth, this study aims to understand how supportive and unsupportive environments engender different sexuality outcomes. Using a cross-classification variable comprised of sexual attraction, relationships and identity, this study examines the effects of individual-level and environmental-level indicators of school integration, religious fundamentalism, experience of prejudice, exposure to violence, and school sanctions. Using multinomial regression analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, this study finds that unsupportive environments limit sexual fluidity and sexuality outcomes, particularly in female respondents, while there is also some indication that more supportive environments engender greater sexual diversity. Given the considerable psychological consequences of repressing one's sexuality, the findings of this study encourage policy interventions at the high-school level to foster greater education and inclusivity to overcome the additive stresses that sexual minority youth face, while encouraging further research into the dynamics of contemporary high schools.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Minorities</subject><subject source="local">Queer</subject><subject source="local">LGBT</subject><subject source="lcsh">Identity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Homosexuality</subject><subject source="lcsh">Stigma (Social psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Sexuality</subject><subject source="lcsh">Adolescents</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref86_f3y" level="file"><did><unittitle>Borgeson, Jade Elizabeth. <emph render="italic">Volunteerism and Divergent Forms of Giving in the Abu Dhabi Community</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0078</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_08c4871b873aed0af2007e079035ad32" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_711a51bd2b39b24cbea1699f6d9fe36a" parent="aspace_08c4871b873aed0af2007e079035ad32" type="folder">2014-0078</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_27d94b1aa4a6c5e906bfc4cece8387dd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: In the last 25 years (Ali, 1986), the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, as a subsidiary of the greater United Arab Emirates, has experienced a massive influx of immigration that has dramatically impacted the demographics and nature of the resident community in the capital.

But it is not clear that these are the motives of the less powerful. Our study considers the conflict of gay marriage in the United States. Through a content analysis of texts of representatives of higher-power, anti-gay marriage authors and lower-power, pro-gay marriage authors, we show that while higher power groups in a conflict consistently characterize the lower power group as trying to dominate, no such evidence can be found in the writings and speeches of low-power groups. Instead, lower-power groups use language of resisting domination by demanding equal treatment, respect and dignity. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and political implications of these findings as well as possibilities for future research.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Antidominance</subject><subject source="lcsh">Dominance (Psychology)</subject><subject source="local">Social dominance theory</subject><subject source="lcsh">Power (Psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Conflict</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref106_3f6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gancheva, Darina Nevelinova. <emph render="italic">Programmatic and Voting Cohesion of European Political Groups in the 7th European Parliament</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0072</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_882248ff66b262b7a4c674a66ea9a0c2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_9bfc52b659d07ba05f7a89d8765a03a0" parent="aspace_882248ff66b262b7a4c674a66ea9a0c2" type="folder">2014-0072</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_75ff3dc29f72a9f9db38371e311f1a37"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: This study diagnoses whether European parties fulfill their function as the primary mechanism for European representation and delegation. The EU party system functions at two levels: national and supranational. At the European elections, EU citizens vote for a national party of their choice. After the elections, the national parties that have received enough votes enter the EP and join one of the transnational European political groups ("EP factions"). These groups are conglomerates of different national parties and form coalitions based on – what they claim to be – a shared ideology. This study examines 1) whether the EP factions are programmatically cohesive, and 2) whether programmatic cohesion, rather than intra-faction pressure, is what explains the high voting cohesion rates of EP factions. Discriminant analysis based on the programmatic profiles of national parties suggests that EP factions are programmatically cohesive units. Variation in the voting agreement rates, however, is mostly due to intra-faction pressure, more prominent in the mainstream pro-EU factions. The programmatic cohesion and voting efficacy of EP factions prove that EP elections and the legislative process are becoming increasingly European and decreasingly national.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Political parties</subject><subject source="lcsh">Political manifestoes</subject><subject source="lcsh">Voting</subject><subject source="lcsh">Elections</subject><subject source="lcsh">European Union</subject><subject source="lcsh">European Parliament</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref96_4gr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gonullu, Damla. <emph render="italic">The Role of Race in Mental Health: A Study on the Children of Cuban Immigrants in Florida</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0069</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_e7ba9a84f7f49e8171f272213b49904f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_d197be85e316170e9d2b29e1edf0d006" parent="aspace_e7ba9a84f7f49e8171f272213b49904f" type="folder">2014-0069</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5c66bffc7247453e03aa10e5dac0f743"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: The racial disparities in mental health are well documented, and there are many studies examining the link between race and mental health. In this paper, I model this relationship by comparing the differences in the depression index scores of Cuban children with differing races and then examining two pathways (discrimination and acculturation) that may contribute to the difference in scores of White and Black/Multiracial Cuban immigrant children to the US. Results indicate that this model provides support for the hypothesis that there is a statistically significant difference in the average depression index scores of White and Black/Multiracial Cuban children. However, this model does not provide support for the two pathways that may contribute to those differences. This study provides a unique lens with which to explore the relationship between race and mental health. Unlike other studies of its kind, it focuses on self-reported discrimination, combines racial discrimination with acculturation, and uses quantitative analysis to better understand this relationship within a highly specific immigrant group, Cuban immigrants.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Racism</subject><subject source="lcsh">Discrimination</subject><subject source="lcsh">Race</subject><geogname source="lcsh">United States of America</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Immigrants</subject><subject source="lcsh">Cubans</subject><subject source="lcsh">Depression, Mental</subject><subject source="lcsh">Acculturation</subject><subject source="lcsh">Health</subject><subject source="lcsh">Mental health</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref98_sfh" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mehra, Abhishek. <emph render="italic">On Fertility, the Preference for Sons and Child Mortality in India</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0062</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_f79749817ed69771bb77ba57b9d7351d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_c05d3ae27b30fa85c386c690287f530a" parent="aspace_f79749817ed69771bb77ba57b9d7351d" type="folder">2014-0062</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_629f1e28edbfcc0521ef68086073fc46"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: The social development theory of demographic transition holds that demographic trends, especially the level of fertility, reflect the degree to which political and economic institutions reflect social justice (Ratcliffe, 1978). The falling fertility rates in India in the last few decades are thought to reflect the success of the processes and policies with the potential to empower women. Au contraire, similar amount of literature exists that argues otherwise - that falls in fertility are believed to be occurring independent of social development. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the changing gender differential in child mortality (which is a reflection of either an intensification or a reduction in the effect of son preference), when there is a fall in fertility. This question is analyzed using two waves of NFHS data to build on the work of Basu (1999) and Gupta and Bhat (1997). I find that in states that were already characterized by a preference for sons, a fall in fertility at a relatively faster pace saw the gender differential in child mortality increase significantly, indicating an intensification of existing son preference at lower parities. This paper ends with policy suggestions.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Social development</subject><subject source="lcsh">Women</subject><subject source="lcsh">Demography</subject><subject source="lcsh">Fertility</subject><subject source="lcsh">Child mortality</subject><subject source="lcsh">Gender</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref85_i2o" level="file"><did><unittitle>Radler, Meike Sydney. <emph render="italic">The social mobility processes of second-generation</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0084</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_19e32f153ef8a6cdbd9e31b720ed8618" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_661dd449b4ec5b7f356b418f8e1900c2" parent="aspace_19e32f153ef8a6cdbd9e31b720ed8618" type="folder">2014-0084</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fe74a915b89d1f269e78f3f1dfb3f898"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: Based on data from semi-structured interviews, this study investigates the social mobility strategies employed by upwardly mobile German-Turkish women living in Berlin. Using educational attainment and labour market achievement as objective indicators of upward mobility, the subjects fit into three categories of social mobility trajectories. Important processes for upward mobility are identified within these categories, using the framework of Bourdieu's theory of capital. In some cases, the domestic transmission of cultural capital is essential for upward mobility, while in others it is a context-specific resource for effective decision-making. Moreover, an expansion of social capital to extend beyond isolated ethnic communities is decisive for all subjects; either for its conversion into necessary cultural capital or through the avoidance of some of the negative effects of social capital on women in certain tightly-bound ethnic communities. While the mobilisation of ethnicity is useful for the upward mobility of a subgroup of German-Turkish women, it is a limitation for others. Finally, regardless of social mobility trajectory categorization, subjects are unified by their lack of symbolic capital in mainstream German society. The strategies they employ to counter this are found to be more assertive and focused on Germany than those employed by the previous generation.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Germans</subject><subject source="lcsh">Turks</subject><subject source="lcsh">Social mobility</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Berlin, Germany</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Women</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Germany</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Social capital (Sociology)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref90_tcx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Taylor, Thomas Llewellyn Mussared. <emph render="italic">"This is a Bangla Place": Identity Claims to Public Space in Downtown Abu Dhabi</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0097</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_4fed31b601470e7261ca693201635d2a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_14cb0f2c1b1c3c4cfffbc5b961708c31" parent="aspace_4fed31b601470e7261ca693201635d2a" type="folder">2014-0097</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_418982c58918446cfb2a42915a7c313a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: There is a square in downtown Abu Dhabi that is known to Bangladeshis the city over as khajur tola.

By analyzing Facebook comments published throughout the year 2014, I ask how PEGIDA influenced a change in the migration discourse on Facebook in Germany. I find, that the rise of PEGIDA in December 2014 encouraged a shift in the migration discourse on Facebook. It reoriented the debate from discussing immigration to rejecting right wing nationalist ideology. As PEGIDA supporters amplified their presence on Facebook, commenters concerned with the extremist discourse overshadowed those in support of immigration. Immigrants themselves were not the primary topic of discussion in the migration discourse in December.<lb/>This is an example of discursive deflection, as the silence regarding immigrants resulted from individuals becoming focused on nationalist stances on migration. The discursive deflection in this research is not unique to Facebook users in Germany. It emerged across social circles and mediums, as individuals turned to defend political correctness amidst a rising nationalist discourse. Facebook comments nonetheless provide an insightful window into discursive deflection, because they make visible a multitude of private opinions, which would not otherwise become public knowledge.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Discursive deflection</subject><subject source="lcsh">Right-wing extremists</subject><subject source="lcsh">Social media</subject><subject source="lcsh">Facebook (Electronic resource)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Immigration</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Germany</geogname><subject source="lcsh">International migration</subject><subject source="local">Migration</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref290_565" level="file"><did><unittitle>Naslund, Cambria Marjorie Melanie. <emph render="italic">A Worthy Cause?: How Social Meanings of Illness Impact the Success of Medical Crowdfunding</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0047</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_655ea57f7584eabb152936d1636c42c4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_6a72f3fbefc2eb72499271d6c6a630f0" parent="aspace_655ea57f7584eabb152936d1636c42c4" type="folder">2015-0047</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e9ed28c2675a9aacff0941f3c108b60d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy<lb/>Abstract: In the past decade, crowdfunding has emerged as an alternative point of access to economic resources. The crowdfunding of medical bills is of particular interest given rising healthcare costs, but has received little attention in research on the dynamics of crowdfunding. As the general public evaluates which cases are worthy of their donations, it becomes increasingly important to understand the factors accounting for differences in donation behavior. One factor specific to this type of crowdfunding is represented by the categories of illness that individuals cite in their requests for donations. Diagnostic categories are both shaped by and shape social meanings and valuations of illness and the ill. Using a dataset of over 40,000 medical fundraising campaigns from the crowdfunding platform, GoFundMe, this research finds that existing theories of social meanings and value rankings of illnesses predict differences in financial support in the context of medical crowdfunding.

I further argue that the identities of the post-Soviet nations are neither nationalistic, nor Soviet, but rather a mix of both, having numerous unique features, yet simultaneously sharing numerous cultural aspects with the people of the ex-Soviet Union.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Social identity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Identity</subject><subject source="local">Postsocialism</subject><subject source="lcsh">Groups, Social</subject><subject source="lcsh">Restaurants/bars</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">USSR</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref271_cch" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rehman, Arfa. <emph render="italic">Embeddedness of Entrepreneurial Activity: The Case of the United Arab Emirates</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0046</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_384f80bd285fccb0808e83b61e63f1b9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ac26782bf95801141c42f70cce857ccf" parent="aspace_384f80bd285fccb0808e83b61e63f1b9" type="folder">2015-0046</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7c62eb3e0b1d17fcb920421c3839d489"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy<lb/>Abstract: The research question this study explores is: what motivations do Emirati entrepreneurs ascribe to their entrepreneurial activity, and how does the context of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) influence these motivations? Using data collected from interviews with Emirati entrepreneurs, as well as representatives of organizations that promote entrepreneurship in the UAE, I investigate the different rationales behind entrepreneurial activity of Emirati entrepreneurs in tandem with the social, cultural, and institutional dimensions of the entrepreneurial context of the UAE. The findings reveal that most Emirati entrepreneurs pursue entrepreneurship with intrinsic motivations of following their passions, proving themselves through a personal challenge, and most commonly, making a social or cultural contribution to the UAE and to the larger Arab world. I conclude that specific aspects of the entrepreneurial context of the UAE give rise to a purposeful and value-focused nature of entrepreneurship, where economic motives are absent or secondary. The study contributes to the literature in economic sociology that finds entrepreneurial activity to be socially embedded, and guided by factors other than economic self-interest.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Economic sociology</subject><geogname source="lcsh">United Arab Emirates</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Entrepreneurship</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref288_m42" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sotoudeh, Ramina. <emph render="italic">"A Match Made in Heaven": Spousal Selection Among Iranians</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0055</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_1d0d4411391df81454dbbb9f03535bee" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_f5818b133cb0e4be094b68fa03d5879a" parent="aspace_1d0d4411391df81454dbbb9f03535bee" type="folder">2015-0055</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ae23db67546eec5bf0c58b546aca6e7f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy<lb/>Abstract: Romantic love, especially in the context of marriage, has been the topic of much attention and debate in recent academic and non-academic discussions. The debate however is often centered on the necessary societal and cultural conditions for producing romantic love in marriage. This paper aims to take a different perspective on the interaction of culture and romantic love. Instead of looking at culture as a direct cause of the role, structure and view of love in marriage among Iranians, this paper follows more contemporary views of culture as heterogeneous and context-specific rather than a singular and uniform driving force of all action.  Using Latent Class Analysis, I uncover classes of people who have different constellations of preferences for selecting their spouse. This analysis reveals that love can be simultaneously associated with other values, which prima facie appear contradictory. This paper finds that love can have different meanings to different people depending on the constellation of other mate selection criteria with which it is chosen and associated; and therefore, that coherence is contextually established.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Culture</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Iran</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Spouses</subject><subject source="lcsh">Love</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref455_6f8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cricco, Nino. <emph render="italic">Is Getting Pregnant the Worst?

The aim of this study is to understand the stigma associated with mental illness in the UAE using 12 semi-structured interviews, with youth ranging from the age of 18-26. The data proves that stigma stems from the generational difference between the mentalities of the youth and their parents. The first difference is illustrated through their different understanding of the relationship between faith and mental illness, and the second difference is demonstrated through the legitimacy and illegitimacy of mental illness. The youth exhibited complex relationships between faith and mental illness whereas older generations were portrayed to have a straightforward understanding, believing that there is a causal relationship between faith and mental health. Moreover the youth advocated for the legitimacy of mental illness through the use of medical intervention. On the other hand, they believed their parents would prefer religious intervention instead of medical intervention because they did not believe in the legitimacy of mental illnesses. The youths understanding of their parents perceptions on mental illnesses influence their own.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_dbd764fe7e9a3572cd6b87a0f1c154b9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Almehrzi, Shereena Salem. <emph render="italic">The Case of Emirati Parents: Making Sense of Child Abuse and Children's Rights</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0144</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_af9f541983c75a7ed38f675ebc154048" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_65f8c003b1a0056106d3841aaa3427b4" parent="aspace_af9f541983c75a7ed38f675ebc154048" type="folder">2018-0144</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_eace66a1625cd141085463a6771c0db6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper is an attempt to unravel how Emirati parents come to understand children's rights, specifically child abuse, and how that relates to their practices of parenting and discipline. Through semi-structured interviews, this paper taps into the lives of Emirati parents, in light of the introduction of Wadeema's Law and its supporting policies. To examine the case of Emirati parents, the frameworks of sense making and the critiques of human rights are used to analyze parents' responses. Parents take part in dynamic negotiations to reconcile ideas of discipline and parenting. They attempt to raise confident, well-mannered and socially integrated children, under conditions that are more challenging from the ones in which they were raised. Parents understand children's rights as merely providing the children with a "good life". In an ever-changing society, the parents try to uphold the ways in which parenting is done, by solving problems within the family and attempting to maintain the power dynamic.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_db8f84692cd37a70a8dd4e375ffed262" level="file"><did><unittitle>AlMemari, Maitha. <emph render="italic">Emirati Youths' Academic Decision-Making</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0120</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_3a5e4c4978842fe426d6dac2ec3506b5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_daa7f3174ccf72aaa0e429bc36c8d982" parent="aspace_3a5e4c4978842fe426d6dac2ec3506b5" type="folder">2018-0120</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9f34d66ef10bb5c48d6429dea1689d01"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study explores how Emirati youth make decisions about higher education, what are the factors that influence them and what is their decision-making process.

What happens when the wife's employment upsets the "normal" or "traditional" household arrangement? While the UAE can be characterized by a traditional gender ideology, it is also a modernizing country and the composition of the workforce is changing. Through in-depth interviews of employees at the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department, the Abu Dhabi Judicial Academy and the Family Guidance Division, I will explore how four factors, collectively, undermine the ideal type of marriage within Emirati couples. The aim of this research is not necessarily a depiction of how many Emirati divorces fell victim to these factors, but how this process works. Knowing this reveals the implications of the traditional and the modernizing self living together, displaying the potential issues that could arise when women's work becomes an issue in a marriage, how the "traditional" household arrangement still stands strong with some Emirati families, and how conclusions of Western literature can be generalizable to the Arab-Muslim world, particularly the UAE, filling a potential gap in current literature.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_321d8e32808048dfc323b2fb360920fa" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dahab, Zaid Abu. <emph render="italic">Dokha Diffusion Outside the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0120</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_26320ed9d84afa8440e082c00120defd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ee04dd0447767863a94d97c030b3fbbb" parent="aspace_26320ed9d84afa8440e082c00120defd" type="folder">2018-0120</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_113c0482d5bdf9c083278848ed17c84a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study explores how Emirati youth make decisions about higher education, what are the factors that influence them and what is their decision-making process.

As the result of large-scale international migration, over 300,000 minor refugees currently attend public schools across Germany's 16 federal states. Research has demonstrated the benefits of refugees' medium- to long-term integration into the workforce, which reduces welfare costs, increases government revenue, and fosters social integration. As many refugee students currently lack linguistic and employability skills, vocational schools, and teachers face increasing challenges of addressing the unique needs of refugee students adequately.  Combining field work, interviews, and survey data, I analyse the situation of refugees at vocational schools from the perspective of teachers. Assessing teacher quality through the concept of teacher self-efficacy, my research is guided by the empirical research question "What factors influence teachers' stress, motivation, and self-efficacy working with refugees at German vocational school?" Findings highlight the impact of motivation on teacher quality, and underscore the need for refugee-specific teacher training.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2c890288f2960155d99c2195d24cb50f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kazemi, Abda. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Bilingualism on Socioeconomic Outcomes for Second-Generation Immigrants in the United States</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0147</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_3581e85aafd2a6b2d4260235e4676917" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_12f19d36e037b4d1474af1154e8c2a5e" parent="aspace_3581e85aafd2a6b2d4260235e4676917" type="folder">2018-0147</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7443ddfd2913d77256dc3595a4d72778"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The United States is home to the greatest diversity of immigrants from both social and national origins. The population of interest, second-generation immigrants, consist of the most and least educated citizens with the highest and lowest rates of poverty. The disparity in wealth reflects the socioeconomic implications of immigration in the U.S., especially on the American economy. The second generation is also a linguistically rich population, of which most speak a mother-tongue language in addition to having native fluency in English. The purpose of the study was to examine whether bilingualism of second-generation immigrants has a positive effect on their socioeconomic outcomes. The study uses online cross-sectional survey responses from self-identified second-generation immigrants in the U.S. (n=3215). The linear regression analysis shows that bilingual second-generation immigrants have higher earnings relative to their English monolingual counterparts; children of Chinese immigrants outperform their second-generation peers; there is no effect of signaling bilingualism in the resume, and all levels of bilingualism improve occupational status. Thus, I conclude that investment in bilingualism for second-generation immigrants will be beneficial for American economy and society.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_bd176861f78906e7b6cd29fe64c4ca9d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kheetan, Daniah. <emph render="italic">Gender Based Violence in Jordan: Legal and Social Protection for Women Against Sexual Assault</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0121</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_f6951891e6e72b9941cf321e56a3a36a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_58da9f641f3c14b6807e0f8f18358765" parent="aspace_f6951891e6e72b9941cf321e56a3a36a" type="folder">2018-0121</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_739fee6fd929e1e2bc0caa77f18253ac"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Jordan successfully revoked Article 308 of its Penal Code, which had previously allowed impunity to rapists if they married their victims. The marry-your-rapist-laws are manifestations of institutionalized Gender Based Discrimination (GBD), and have contributed to systematic marginalization and Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Sexual Violence (SV) against women. These laws have historically been controversial, and the revocation is seemingly positive. However the social controversy around revocation shows that revocation failed to address the social and cultural nuances. Thus, to provide legal and social protection for women against Gender Based and Sexual Violence, this capstone argues that a sociological understating of these laws and women's experience must precede legal change. Thus, this capstone constructs and deploys a sociological framework of analysis on qualitative sociological data from a series of interviews conducted with stakeholders in Jordan. The paper found that the policy an social environment around women's issues are constructed and affected by four factors: Society and Culture, Economic History, Political History, and Distinct Contextual Factor, Current Political Climate for Jordan. The Capstone concludes with policy recommendations that primarily address the enhancement of women's legal and social protection against SV, and on a larger extent, end GBD and GBV in Jordan.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2fd4851a611cbcb0cdbf1a5b854d4471" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kohut, Roman. <emph render="italic">One Thousand Kilometers of Difference: A Set of Recommendations for the Ministry of Education of Ukraine on Integration of IDP Youth into Lviv, Ukraine</emph>

The data collected from a sample of 19 local and IDP secondary school and university students through focus groups and questionnaires suggests that, while secondary schools and higher academic institutions are generally accessible to IDP youth, the availability of financial aid in universities remains paramount in allowing them to pursue their academic interests. The process of receiving financial aid should be streamlined regardless of whether the university reports primarily to the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Culture. Given that IDPs are mainly clustered in schools with Russian language of instruction, further social studies should be conducted to assess and conceptualize the presence of segregated education in the city. There also is an urgent and continuously growing need for professional academic advising and career development services in secondary schools and universities in Ukraine that are not provided in reality despite the already existing decrees. Furthermore, the urgent need for an intercultural education and cultural engagement program in the city's secondary schools and universities is apparent.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_bc95b3ebb379c9a0709f0872cdad87e8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ladhani, Adam. <emph render="italic">Workers or Citizens: An Analysis of US and Canadian High-Skilled Temporary Migration Laws and Debates</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0168</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_1cd8d6edb0e20f4ca046e43ce37a0181" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_d59f56d1ae03508d9993aaf9503307b7" parent="aspace_1cd8d6edb0e20f4ca046e43ce37a0181" type="folder">2018-0168</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c2103ff699757e3a3084b50e9c6b858c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>My capstone project focuses on high-skilled temporary foreign worker programs in the U.S. and Canada.

Three first-year student residence buildings were allocated to a Control Group (N=155), Group A (N=103), and Group B (N=58). Each building's general waste, paper/cardboard recycling, and plastic/can recycling was weighed and rated (on quality of separation) each day by the cleaning staff for a 5-week baseline period and 5-week post-treatment period. Each apartment within Group A and B received labeled paper/cardboard and plastic/can recycling bins [infrastructure alteration] during a one-week treatment period. Additionally, Group B received weekly feedback pamphlets on their recycling rates, quality, and tips for improvement [feedback treatment] throughout the post-treatment measurements. After both treatments, a survey was conducted on all groups to measure recycling knowledge, as well as treatment saturation, spillover, and student opinions on interventions. Data shows promising evidence that infrastructure alteration leads to improved recycling behavior and knowledge, while the feedback treatment had marginal to no observed effect on recycling improvement.

I specifically focus on how gender norms affect both entrance into the profession and how the tour guides conduct themselves within the field. The analysis draws on 20 interviews with tour guides around Stone Town, Zanzibar. Based on this data, I argue that due to the function of tour guiding as a performance of cultural authenticity, female tour guides occupy a position of contradiction as both the challenger and performer of authentic culture.   The paper examines this contradiction by discussing the ways in which tour guiding is socially constructed as a male profession. Additionally, it explores the barriers that maintain these gender norms and the tools women use to break these barriers while maintaining authenticity. I conclude that the women who become tour guides show an understanding of both gender norms and market dynamics which they manipulate in order to gain entrance into the profession.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_3b0c3ade48c1f0f35b6d5efeb0f3aa8e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Taylor, Hannah. <emph render="italic">The Massachusetts Opioid Epidemic: Course and Coverage</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0157</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_b1767eec5a4df6585b928f84a276886e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_b626e8d09696439fa3e4f498c9928c54" parent="aspace_b1767eec5a4df6585b928f84a276886e" type="folder">2018-0157</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b9ecf9b2db16e5b4681f7830332de94a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The United States is currently in the grips of the worst drug epidemic the country has ever seen, the opioid epidemic, and Massachusetts is one of the states that is hardest hit. As of 2016, approximately 5 people died a day from opioid overdose in Massachusetts (Bebinger, 2016). Much of the existing literature on the opioid epidemic focuses on the link between overprescription of opioid painkillers and addiction which eventually leads to overdose and death. Information about what populations are hit worse in terms of race, socioeconomic status and lifestyle factors is also increasingly documented. This research aims to add to the existing body of literature surrounding the opiate epidemic by examining town-level correlates of the opioid epidemic in Massachusetts. As town-level correlates are predictive of both the intensity of the epidemic and representative of community resources in fighting the epidemic, understanding them merits increased attention. Key findings include the correlation between town characteristics of low income, low educational attainment, low proportion of white people, and high political conservatism with high overdose death rates. The second paper employs text analysis to illuminate how the epidemic enters public consciousness, and what community-level characteristics shape newspaper coverage.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ca457664a9b4773672752a7dbb0be60b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tehputri, Carrisa. <emph render="italic">The Outsiders' Grief: Behind the Radicalization of British Muslims</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0159</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_4d73037841bbed8f8d7554b9cd1c5a24" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_be749ca3790a9590f910a02f047b7daa" parent="aspace_4d73037841bbed8f8d7554b9cd1c5a24" type="folder">2018-0159</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_889b43bfc8f3ff05acddb10d346ab0d8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This project explores narratives of second- to third-generation British Muslims who are often discriminated for their identity and the reason why the discrimination are experienced by many yet only enhances extremist ideology among a minority. The narratives of de- radicalized and non-radicalized interviewees are compared in order to examine the role of multiple outlets utilized by non-radicalized interviewees to evade extremist ideology. The interviews reveal that the availability of outlets to nurture multiple components of one's identity is effective in preventing discriminated individuals from joining extremist groups - a notion that policy discourses often misses. On the other hand, those who identify strongly with only a single component of their identity tend to act violently when it is 'under attack'. With the findings from 52 hours of interview, this study aims to augment existing studies on identity and counterterrorism, as well as to suggest new directions for related research.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_771e0869dfdb9b5c746c562091f36282" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ahmad, Lama. <emph render="italic">The Case of Internet Research Agency Twitter Propaganda in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0190</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_ab98f9935f2a5ba02849c6a2e9b39062" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_d85b2660b824dbd2d30e95d209c958e6" parent="aspace_ab98f9935f2a5ba02849c6a2e9b39062" type="folder">2019-0190</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d0bdbac6bdcabfd52ee527d87f91cff9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The purpose of this study is to shed light on the features of tweets that drove Americans to engage with propaganda disseminated by the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) on Twitter around the time of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and to understand the differences between the content of originally authored versus retweeted IRA propaganda tweets.

The women who participated in the research varied in age, ranging from elderlies (over the age of sixty) to youth (twenty-year-olds), demonstrating the change in perceptions over the span of generations. The topics that will be discussed are kinship as related to lineage and family name, social interactions involving gatherings and social media, systems of beliefs such as religion and tradition, and generational differences in mentalities. The rapid transformation that the country underwent including the contact with people from diverse backgrounds since the 1960s lead to a shift in the mentalities of the Emirati people. All of which affected the criteria with which women in society based their conceptualization of one another's reputation as well as their own. Ultimately, this paper aims to address the shortcomings in the existing field of research by deconstructing the concept of 'reputation' in Emirati society.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ee069cdb02015a3e71dfa2a1e77cdcd1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Gergawi, Amal. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Stressors on the Mental Health of Displaced and Non-Displaced Children and Adolescents in Niger</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0193</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_c2e53f0501e1cfd7e46f99fefa7191d4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_5aa8ca99d4abad9e8f168981e786a224" parent="aspace_c2e53f0501e1cfd7e46f99fefa7191d4" type="folder">2019-0193</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5653c05fbee5e6d89f69260dfe2c5f10"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Reflected in the student demographic, the West-African landlocked nation hosts a growing forcibly displaced community composed of refugees, returnees, and IDPs residing alongside civilians.

Specifically, the study examines the effects of five stressors –hunger, community safety, age appropriateness, future mobility, and French literacy– on student mental health operationalized through the following instruments: the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Response to Stress Questionnaire-Stress Levels, the Response to Stress Questionnaire-Involuntary Engagement, and the Preschool Self-Regulation Assessment. The main findings of this study suggest that community safety and French literacy significantly affect the mental health of displaced and non-displaced children and adolescents, implying that displaced students do not differ from their non-displaced counterparts. These results contribute to expanding the frontiers of literature on mental health stressors and displaced youth in the Global South.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_30571cbebd27cbc33f5a584dde029b11" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alshimmari, Sara Abdulla Satam Altraibeel. <emph render="italic">Perspectives on Marriage and Gender Roles Through the Lens of Youth from Abu Dhabi</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0176</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_6f4936f1bde7653ff7fb6d03ee2bf802" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_451c2aab71d1ccb0385cf5d9c5042aa0" parent="aspace_6f4936f1bde7653ff7fb6d03ee2bf802" type="folder">2019-0176</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_60c048b302415bddf51eac9cf9c40e5e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This research project examines youths' perceptions on marriage and marriage roles.

Single teachers were also found to have a stronger relationship between their mental health and burnout rates.

Using data from Global TIES for Children's 3EA project, "Education in Emergencies: Evidence for Action (3EA)", the study investigates the relationship between religion and academic outcomes of primary school students in Sierra Leone. Secondary data analysis shows a very low significant correlation between being Muslim and one's academic achievement and finds no correlation between child annual percent attendance and being Muslim. However, the joint role of religion and gender with regard to student outcomes proves to be significant when looking at the comparative beta values among the religion-gender groups in the regression analysis. I find that being both female and Muslim yields higher academic achievement than any other group in the study. The study also finds a significant positive association between student attendance and academic outcomes but does not succeed in manifesting a mediating effect of attendance. Overall, this study aims to highlight the importance of understanding and evaluating the factors that influence schooling outcomes in conflict-affected and low-income countries like Sierra Leone.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c9ac4515438d71c088953b6b443abdd9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Banga, Gigs. <emph render="italic">The Young Expat: The Development of Expatriate Adolescence in the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0199</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_e2a0d5b526beeec23c08b63e71a934bf" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0e05ae029488b067fccc5a31c4a33a65" parent="aspace_e2a0d5b526beeec23c08b63e71a934bf" type="folder">2019-0199</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ea528f3128adca844f098a033237a909"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The stories of young expatriates, those who emigrate with their families to the U.A.E. is a complex one.

The paper investigates and explores whether, how, and to what extent the intersection of an expatriate way of living – contained within expectations about what it means to a 'good' expat – conflicts with a restrictive nature of adolescent development. The social phenomenon is called Expatriate Adolescence. The process involves foreign teenagers toiling with the central question of how they come to navigate their new home in Abu Dhabi - be it social, familial or cultural, what unique challenges does this populace encounter? Given the changing ethnoscape of this country, there is much variance in the degree to which the young expatriates experience a 'curated' adolescent life in the U.A.E. Hence, the studying of this population is vital in filling a lacuna in the scholarship on Gulf migration, as well as in adolescent development theory.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_039c7f342da7e58602f32dac82de1fe3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Booth, Sara. <emph render="italic">Female Migration, Adaptation, and Child Health in Urban India: Evidence from NFHS-3</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0157</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_f90cab9701ca4109264a7f08c30c85c2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_795c85359d089df558d6f74c404aba6a" parent="aspace_f90cab9701ca4109264a7f08c30c85c2" type="folder">2019-0157</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6e9bad2d2576434ce42b944f8bb51d08"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of female rural-urban migration on child health outcomes in urban India, within the framework of the disruption and adaptation theory of migration.

I find no direct support for the hypothesis that children of rural-urban migrants are worse off in terms of health. Instead, my findings suggest that small differences in child health are explained by observed differences in wealth and education among urban residents. Additionally, contrary to the belief that migrants eventually adapt to their new environment, I find that outcomes and socioeconomic factors do not improve over time among rural-urban migrants. This paper deepens the understanding of urban child health and suggests that future research and policies should address the urban poor and uneducated.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9ded293d635aa300a390f0111928f57f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hassan, Sharif El Shishtawy. <emph render="italic">Islamic Education in the UAE: Promoting National Security, Refuting Islamists, and Nation Branding</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0167</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_a551133e6bd1984d193bac7f50bdb63f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_9376d6be3d3842dcd8e9addedf6ef40e" parent="aspace_a551133e6bd1984d193bac7f50bdb63f" type="folder">2019-0167</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4278accd750b774ab9bcb26dbd1eca2d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In recent years the content and character of state-sponsored religious education in the Middle East have been the subject of an intense debate. Upon analyzing the Islamic Education textbooks taught to all Muslim students in every school across the UAE, I make three arguments pertaining to the role of Islamic education in the UAE. First, the UAE's Islamic Education curriculum works to legitimize the state and promote nationalsecurity by inculcating in students a sense of loyalty to the nation and obedience to its ruler. Second, that the curriculum works to present an image, directed atlocal and international audiences, of religious moderation and tolerance. Third, that the curriculum works to support government objectives of economic growth by presenting the ideal Muslim as one who is hard-working and productive. I situate the UAE's Islamic Education curriculum and textbooks within broader, long-standing state efforts to cultivate a loyal citizenry devoted to state agendas related to political stability, modernization, and economic growth, refuting Islamists narratives, and being recognized by the West as a natural partner in the fight to eradicate religious extremism and promote tolerance in the region.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d01a1cf6df72c3bf6f1a547391f4cdaa" level="file"><did><unittitle>Humayun, Aaima. <emph render="italic">"It is like my life has become an answer [to these questions]…": Understanding the Accounts of Acid Violence Victims in Pakistan</emph>

Drawing on a series of interviews with female victims of acid violence in Pakistan, this paper explores the discursive strategies employed by the victims across different situations.The findings suggest several patterns: providing unfiltered accounts, denying identity of a victim of violence, using socially acceptable language, embracing an identity of a professional, negotiating an increased social status, and shifting identities from that of a victim, to a survivor and a savior of other victims.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_a68ccc8ca26ec5ec844532bb3a6410ca" level="file"><did><unittitle>Imran, Rabiya. <emph render="italic">Women and Pakistani Sharia: A Case Study of Khula Laws</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0209</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_65b98f7fc007b47e9e6b27cf5324ce14" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_752c186192343f1057f605bdd07d4650" parent="aspace_65b98f7fc007b47e9e6b27cf5324ce14" type="folder">2019-0209</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0649cb93c2d500797745028162ec667d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>How is Sharia contextualized when granting rights to women in the post-colonial context?

My analysis examines eighteen cases from the Lahore High Court and five from the Punjab and Haryana Court in detail. I argue that in both India and Pakistan, Sharia and Islam are being utilized to create rights for women in the realm of divorce, where they don't exist through non-Islamic means. I also argue that in the Lahore High Court, the court uses language that is filled with Islamic symbolism to grant legitimacy to its decisions that are favorable to women. However, this symbolism is not found at the Punjab and Haryana High Court. To make sense of this variation, I argue, Shariah is used as a reliable device in both Islamic and non-Islamic contexts to achieve similar results, albeit with varying motivations.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1968cda27f6a0f9a7fe2453e20e1848b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jo, Atoka. <emph render="italic">The Use of Pseudonym, Team Composition and Identity in Cryptocurrency</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0198</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_595fbc0e8e0a3ee3cb59ee515d76709c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_c6316180a1022ee3e9f90212b0da5343" parent="aspace_595fbc0e8e0a3ee3cb59ee515d76709c" type="folder">2019-0198</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_df088d26e3906b967e4d42e7d5c63b17"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Satoshi Nakamoto is known as the founder of Bitcoin and the pioneer of cryptocurrency.

I examine these outcomes by using Facebook, Grindr and the Gay Ad Network as recruitment sites, linking ads to a questionnaire which 1823 US-based MSM completed. Using a series of one-sided t-tests, I find that MSM who are on PrEP have significantly more sexual partners, are more likely to be involved in concurrent relationships, use condoms less frequently and report higher incidences of bacterial STDs than MSM who are not on PrEP. I then use propensity score matching to control for a set of demographic and behavioral characteristics associated with PrEP use to estimate the effect of taking PrEP on the above-mentioned outcomes. I again find statistically significant results for all outcomes. Lastly, I employ a conjoint experiment to compare how MSM who are on PrEP compare to those who are not on PrEP make partner-selection decisions. I find that MSM on PrEP do not take the number of their partner's previous sexual relationships nor their condom use into account to make this decision, while those who are not on PrEP do.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ed8d3cff7b3dd9521265694fa9a027da" level="file"><did><unittitle>Karpauskaite, Ruta. <emph render="italic">NETWORKS OF INFLUENCE Think Tank Behavior, Relationships and Bias in Washington DC</emph>

While such  literature has attempted to delineate this problem, most of the research has focused on external analysis of think tanks as part of the larger policymaking system. Leveraging ethnographic research conducted within the think tank community itself rather than externally, my analysis questions the consensus view that think tank behavior is largely driven by seeking policy impact; instead finding that think tank behavior is conducted according to internal and external relationships. With a greater understanding of think tank behavior, I seek to better understand the origin of bias and how it materializes in think tanks' most visible output - external research.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b1f2b3db999aeff048a97b3d343b9a94" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mahne, Matilda. <emph render="italic">Change in Peacebuilding Diplomacy: A Case Study of Finland</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0140</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_3fbebb2d47778d814c7543eff99b637e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_d0425e5946e7157d501ae892b420bb7c" parent="aspace_3fbebb2d47778d814c7543eff99b637e" type="folder">2019-0140</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_34bd3299c4dfc6dab4be0ddad6614f7f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In 2008, Finland created a National Action Plan for the implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolution on Women, Peace and Security that was unanimously adopted in October 2000. The resolution was significant as it was the first of its kind to specifically address women's role in conflict and peacebuilding. Though Finland has been on the forefront of the peacebuilding scene for years, the country shaped its action plan for the resolution a few years later than many other states. This research project looks deeper into this foreign policy change and endeavours to answer the following question: why did Finland adopt its National Action Plan for the United Nations Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security in 2008? By looking into policy documents and speeches, as well as drawing from public debate and previous literature on foreign policy change and policy diffusion, I find that the Finnish case warrants a multi-layered explanation: using the policy diffusion mechanisms of learning, competition, coercion and emulation, the drive for Finnish foreign policy change has taken place on three distinct levels (international, regional, and civil society), where the three levels mutually created the condition for change.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1d8bbac320b29656bae3a53f8584d021" level="file"><did><unittitle>Malik, Warda. <emph render="italic">Religion, State, and Nation: Claims to Citizenship Among Pakistan's Ahmadiyya Community</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0186</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_52453026678d156ec36722df5ecab66f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_8b166ab563782c8a0305f35cd213f186" parent="aspace_52453026678d156ec36722df5ecab66f" type="folder">2019-0186</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_837d0e5a2ce79169d92266aba917cf81"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This research focuses on Pakistan's Ahmadiyya community, who self-identity as Muslims but the state recognises them as a non-Muslim minority, to demonstrate how the state narratives about inclusion in Pakistan have been used to exclude and reduce this community to the status of second-class citizens. Most of the existing literature has focused on how the Pakistani nation- state has constructed its imagined community based on exclusionary citizenship, but little is said about the grievances that the marginalised have from the state and what it can teach us about national citizenship. Given the exclusion of Ahmadis from Pakistan's national discourse, I have conducted twelve semi-structured interviews with community members and conducted an analysis of op-ed articles in an alternative media publication to understand counter-narratives of Ahmadis in relation to the dominant narratives of state. This research focuses on counter-narratives of Ahmadis about Pakistani identity in order to broaden our understanding of identity through a focus on the excluded citizen rather than the State. The research sheds light on what national identity looks like when viewed through the lens of exclusion.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6f3c89a238c1f6e900a99150add8943d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Olson, Erik. <emph render="italic">Neither Here nor There: Non-political transnationalism amongst Bosnian refugee families and the blurring of migrant taxonomies </emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0172</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_73aca2c1f0c5d17cf53464380fc99a37" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_914af91679ad6ab1ae974c61c009bad0" parent="aspace_73aca2c1f0c5d17cf53464380fc99a37" type="folder">2019-0172</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1a3f48996476d20f662ab3544a2b21d1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Third-country resettlement is one of the UN's three "durable solutions" made available to refugees worldwide. While millions have benefitted from such programmes, there remains a gap in knowledge concerning the long-term effects of resettlement on the experiences of refugees. At the same time, migration studies literature has established a dichotomy between voluntary and involuntary migrants. Here, a tendency is shown which views connections to people in places in the country of origin as distinctly political in form and motivation. This essay takes a transnationalist approach to studying the experiences of Bosnian refugee families resettled to Boise, Idaho, USA during and immediately after the Bosnian War (1992-1995). Focusing on transnational practices developed by refugees over two decades in the United States, my analysis questions the prevailing image of refugees as inherently political transnational actors. This study investigates non-political forms of refugee transnationalism by examining patterns of ownership and flows of goods, funds, and people between Boise and Bosnia. In doing so, I seek to blur the lines between traditional migrant taxonomies and contribute to a more holistic understanding of the refugee as an informed and empowered international actor.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0b77fe2b57f0b6e64d1ebd0dbf40f60a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Szekeres, Melinda. <emph render="italic">Navigating Entrepreneurship: The Role of Law in Organizational Emergence in the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0171</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_24a3e2d7c6ab3bdba73192313fa93281" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_0d7f65a302501248a2591ed491c9b9f1" parent="aspace_24a3e2d7c6ab3bdba73192313fa93281" type="folder">2019-0171</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_277b84525c75f7a17bab889a8b7cb75a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This project observes the law and policy that govern entrepreneurship in the UAE, comparing it, empirically, to the lived experiences of entrepreneurs on the ground. I observe entrepreneurship as a novel work environment that offers starkly different experiences for UAE nationals and residents alike. The distinction, primarily, manifests in the levels of ease of organizational emergence for both groups. I suggest that the UAE offers a quasi-experimental insight into the two different pools of entrepreneurs that result by having a 'high' or 'low' bar—the former for residents and the latter for nationals. In comparing the experiences of entrepreneurs emerging across these two pools, this capstone asks whether a more 'helpful' legal and institutional environment increases the success the rates of entrepreneurial ventures. Based on its finding that the increased ease of starting up is not necessarily an advantage, this study complicates the theoretical assumption that low barriers to starting up are necessarily always preferred because they lead to a higher aggregate entrepreneurial activity.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c37822977e9d7ba6a489f6d1710c943e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wong, Theros. <emph render="italic">The Power of Ethnic Politics in Foreign Policy Making Decisions: A Comparison of Malaysia's Mahathir and the Philippines' Duterte in the Belt Road Initiative</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0196</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_d754d63d8f767fa10ef38bafabcc24fa" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_4fc979c6e40c17e9efb16f2372ac2f8a" parent="aspace_d754d63d8f767fa10ef38bafabcc24fa" type="folder">2019-0196</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2470038cf9249201ffa717fc4c2b9b1b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Malaysia's rejection of China's Belt Road Initiative came as a shock to the international community. In order to understand the driving forces behind this rejection, this research created a structured approach to examine plausible factors that could lead to this policy decision, including the economic, geopolitics and domestic factors. Upon examining these factors in comparison to the Philippines, which accepted the Belt Road investments, I conclude that domestic ethnic politics act as a catalyst to Prime Minister Mahathir's decision.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_7f7e5dfc170419ca86a54e5929b02c30" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yu, Alyssa. <emph render="italic">Post Generation: Social Media Use of WeChat and Facebook by Chinese and American College Students</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0179</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_dcd7df7bbd3dee4e740278d098a5c731" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container id="aspace_ff110391639d1172af597e410b0446d6" parent="aspace_dcd7df7bbd3dee4e740278d098a5c731" type="folder">2019-0179</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_164393dae9e22120c0e49162e75ef6a4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This project is a comparative study of contemporary social media usage of both Chinese and American social media sites by Chinese and American NYUSH freshmen conducted through mixed methods of social media content analysis and interviews.

The experiment was conducted with a sample of working age and retired Canadians, outside the laboratory. During the experiment the participants have completed either self-affirmation task, perspective-taking task, combination of both tasks, or participated in a control condition before answering the measures of attitudes and perceived threat towards Syrian refugees and participating in the behavioral task measuring the respondents' readiness to support this outgroup. Results show that self-affirmation and combined intervention were effective in fostering inclusive behavior towards the outgroup. This study has also found that the middle aged respondents had less malleable views, and were less likely to be motivated to change their behavior by a one-time intervention. The participants between 35-54 years of age were more likely to hold strong unfavorable views of Syrian refugees due to the perceived competition over finite resources and welfare benefits in Canada. This paper also draws further implications for the researchers and policymakers.</p></scopecontent></c></c></c><c id="aspace_de4f26cf0774b0de45b608044e59d36f" level="series"><did><unittitle>Other Capstone Documentation</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2019" type="inclusive">2016-2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_ea6bef222202685d5fd03ed6749be069" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">cds-asc</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c571d43b4dc52565240710e01be2dfc8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Other Capstone Documentation includes acquired audio and video from Divisional Capstone Festivals, student presentations about their projects, and other materials that are about Capstones but are not documents of the projects themselves.
