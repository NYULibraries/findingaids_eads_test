    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>The J.A. Rogers collection consists of material that appears to have been collected by Lt. Cdr. J.A. Rogers in the early 1960s.  Research conducted in April 2021 shows that a J.A. (James Alexander) Rogers (1916-1988) served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during World War II, at the rank of sub-lieutenant from 1940-1946, stationed on a series of Royal Navy vessels based in Plymouth, Gibraltar, and Taranto, Italy.  </p><p>According to the London Gazette, a sub-lieutenant J.A. Rogers was promoted from the rank of sub-lieutenant to lieutenant with seniority in September 1953 (https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/40022/page/6290).  Based on comments in the typescript text "Off-Shore Drilling," included in this collection, it appears that Rogers spent a year in the southern part of the Arabian Gulf, presumably around 1962, and after that returned to Britain to teach at the Naval Staff College at Greenwich.</p><p>The Navy News records a Lt. Cdr. J.A. Rogers being promoted to the rank of Commander in the 6th Mine Countermeasures Squadron, based in Singapore, in which Rogers commanded the squadron and served as commander of the HMS Houghton, in October 1967 (Navy News, Sept. 1967, and Navy News, Feb. 1968, p. 14).  The London Gazette also records the reinstatement from retirement, and eventual retirement, of a Commander J.A. Rogers, OBE, in 1979 and 1981.  </p><p>According to the website "Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) Officers, 1939-1945," J.A. Rogers died in Willand, Cullompton, Devonshire on 7 December 1988 (https://www.unithistories.com/officers/RNVR_officersR2.html).  </p><p>Although there is no definitive proof that all of these listings for J.A. Rogers refer to the same person, and the creator of this collection, there is a strong likelihood that they do.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Content Description</head>
<p>Photographic prints, typescript texts, printed materials, map, related chiefly to the discovery of oil near Das Island, in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, 1962-1963.  </p><p>Photographs consist of 15 silver-gelatin prints, taken by British Petroleum photographer Guy Gravitt in 1962, depicting the inauguration of oil production at the Umm Shaif oilfield in the Arabian Gulf, as well as portraits of the ruler of Abu Dhabi emirate, Sheikh Shakhbout bin Sultan.  These photographs are all captioned on the verso, and were in an envelope addressed to Lt. Cdr. J.A. Rogers of the Royal Navy.  In addition, there are three smaller prints, undated, depicting a group of men wearing Arabian national dress over their tuxedos, while on a boat.  It is possible that one of the men in this group could be Rogers.</p><p>The typescript text consists of lecture notes titled "Off-Shore Drilling," which describe the recent oil discoveries in Abu Dhabi, and were used by Lt. Cdr. J.A. Rogers, presumably at the Royal Navy Staff College in Greenwich, in the early 1960s. The text also includes two maps and one plan, depicting Das Island, the coastline of the Trucial States, and a plan of the Umm Shaif drilling facilities.</p><p>One printed item, titled "Abu Dhabi Marine Areas, Ltd.: Persian Gulf Handbook," consists of a guide produced for employees of Abu Dhabi Marine Areas (ADMA), the concession jointly operated by British Petroleum and the Compagnie Francaise des Petroles, to search for oil in the waters off of the coast of Abu Dhabi.  The guidebook, containing 23 pages of text, is undated, but likely published around 1954, and describes the history, tribes, and customs of the people of Abu Dhabi.  </p><p>Other items include a prospectus for a planned real estate development at the base of historic Picklecombe Fort, west of Plymouth, in which Rogers had expressed an interest, from 1963.  The collection also includes a map, "Rough Tribal Map of Arabia," which had originally been part of the book "The Arab of the Desert" by H.R.P. Dickson (London:  Allen and Unwin, 1949).</p><p>Although little information about the provenance is available, the materials appear to have been collected and used by Lieutenant Commander J.A. Rogers of the British Royal Navy.</p>  </scopecontent>
