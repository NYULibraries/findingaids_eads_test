      <abstract id="aspace_09843313a8a244eac48c6c0379ef2269">Ron Kolm is a writer, editor, artist, promoter, has been the de facto archivist and an enduring member of the Soho and East Village arts scene from the mid-1970s to the present day. During this period, he has been involved with several independent bookstores, small magazines, performance spaces, and the outsider art scene. Kolm continues to be heavily involved in avant garde work, serving as a main organizer of The Unbearables, a loosely organized group of downtown writers and artists, perhaps best known for their protests against mainstream notions of "good" or "bad" literature and art. Through his work, Kolm has collected over 6000 items that comprise this collection. Items include: signed first editions and chapbooks by authors such as Kathy Acker, Lynne Tillman, Gary Indiana, Spalding Gray, Patrick McGrath, Harry Mathews, Hal Sirowitz, Max Blagg, Janice Eidus, Constance DeJong, David Wojnarowicz, among many others; as well as: complete runs of Between C and D, Red Tape, Zone, The Portable Lower East Side, Beat, Vox, and The National Poetry Magazine of the Lower East Side, among others.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Ron Kolm, poet, writer, editor, artist, promoter, and long-time member of the downtown scene served as the de facto archivist of the Soho and East Village arts scene beginning in the mid-1970s. Through his work in various independent bookstores and his active involvement in small magazines, performance spaces, and the outsider art scene, Ron Kolm, amassed this collection. Ron's poem "Suburban Ambush" was selected by Robert Siegle as the title for his book, Suburban Ambush: Downtown Writing and the Fiction of Insurgency (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989). Kolm continues to be heavily involved in avant garde work, serving as a main organizer of The Unbearables, a loosely organized group of downtown writers and artists, perhaps best known for their protests against the poetry of The New Yorker and other acts of "poetic terrorism" intended to point out how society constructs the notions of "good" or "bad" literature and art.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Ron Kolm Papers consists of material created and collected by Kolm from 1970 up to the present, broadly documenting artists and writers in this period of the Downtown Scene. The collection comprises his personal correspondence with members of that scene; manuscripts in various stages; photographs; audio recordings; video recordings; clippings files from newspapers and magazines; posters; original art; production files for his small press, Low Tech Press; and materials about the various events and publications of The Unbearables. He also has collected books, serials, zines, and other ephemera relating to the scene of which he is considered an integral part. The collection also includes inscribed copies of books; signed first editions and chapbooks by authors such as Kathy Acker, Lynne Tillman, Gary Indiana, Walter Abish, Spaulding Gray, Patrick McGrath, Harry Mathews, Hal Sirowitz, Max Blagg, Janice Eidus, Constance DeJong, David Wojnarowicz, Jeffrey Cyphers Wright; and complete runs of significant literary magazines of the 1980-1990s scene, including Between C and D, Appearances, Red Tape, Benzene, Zone, The Portable Lower East Side, Beat, Vox, Semi(o)texte, Peau Sensible, Raw, and The National Poetry Magazine of the Lower East Side. Assembly magazines, zines, posters, flyers, catalogues of exhibitions, and announcements for readings provide a sense of the downtown arts scene of the Soho and East Village during its artistic height. The collection is also rich in materials relating to non-literary artists, and includes some writings by those artists, including David Wojnarowicz, Keith Haring, Art Spiegelman, and others.</p>
