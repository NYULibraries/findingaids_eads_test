      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Nelson Sullivan (1948-1989) was a video artist who documented downtown New York City in the 1980s. Originally from South Carolina, Sullivan moved to Manhattan in the 1970s and began filming the city's art world and gay scene. He captured John Sex, Sylvia Miles, RuPaul, and other performers at downtown bars and nightclubs including Danceteria, the Limelight, Palladium, and the Pyramid Club. Sullivan also chronicled house parties at his apartment at 5 Ninth Avenue in the Meatpacking District, gallery openings, park and street festivals, conversations with taxi drivers, and the ruminations of his friends including fashion designer Alexis Del Lago and journalist Michael Musto on film. He recorded almost 2,000 hours of tape, at first using a VHS-loading camera and later an 8mm video camera. Sullivan's filmmaking is recognizable for its point of view transitions and its stream-of-consciousness narration. He also often pointed a wide-angle lens at his own face while filming to record his commentary on the people, performances, or events that he captured. Sullivan made films up until his death from a heart attack on July 4, 1989.</p>

            <p>The first disc of this video starts with footage from the morning of November 20, 1983, when the Chelsea Hotel lobby is being prepared for a party. Nelson goes to room 604 to spend time with friends, including Sandy Dancer, Michael Musto, and Deloris French. Sandy Dancer prepares for her performance later in the day. When a news camera crew interviews Sandy, she says that the party is a birthday celebration for the Chelsea.</p>
            <p>The second disc begins with people flowing in and out of room 604 while Sandy Dancer finishes preparing for her performance. There is a dance performance in the stairwell before the main party in the lobby, where, among others, Sandy Dancer and Michael Musto perform. Ed Koch appears after a couple songs in order to honor the Chelsea Hotel on its 100th anniversary and declare November 20, 1983 Chelsea Hotel Day. Koch also presents playwright Arthur Miller with a plaque honoring his time living at the Chelsea. Miller gives brief remarks before the unveiling of his plaque. Ulick O'Connor speaks on behalf of the history of the Chelsea, and there are a couple more performances.</p>

            <p>The video starts with RuPaul gogo dancing at the Atlanta nightclub Weekends on February 27, 1986, then Nelson goes into RuPaul's private dressing room with Larry Tee and a couple of others. When RuPaul finishes his set, he joins the group. The video jumps to the next day, with Nelson spending time in a friend's house. His friend then gives him a tour on a drive through Atlanta on their way to lunch at Burton's Grill. The tour continues before they return to the house where Larry Tee and others have gathered to watch some recorded performances. Larry Tee then takes Nelson on a drive to what will become Larry Tee's Celebrity Club for a tour, which is still under construction. The video jumps again, to Nelson chatting with drag queens (Sultra, Wanda, and others) getting ready for the night and then doing a private performance/interview for Nelson. Finally, the video jumps to recordings of music videos by Spencer Thorton for The Now Explosion, RuPaul, and an unknown band. The video cuts off at the beginning of a clip titled "RuPaul, Tune-Up King."</p>

            <p>Sponsored by the Fashion Patrol, this video starts with a competition for "Best Wig". Judges are Ms. Robby, James St. James, Michael Musto, Ms. Brandywine Heaven, and Michael Angelo. The next day, Nelson has plans to go watch the filming of "Slaves of New York" in the East Village where we run into Michael Musto again.  The video then switches to a party in a New York apartment, where we find the "String Fellows" interviewing people about a fashion show that was attended. It then ends with plans to go to Palladium.</p>

            <p>At 11:30 pm on March 5th, the night starts with plans to visit Mars Bar for bingo night. Without hesitation to catch the light green sign that spells out "DRUGS", Nelson Sullivan filmed this particular footage for an HBO special at the "Mars Needs Bingo" event that happens once a month.  Features Lahoma Van Zant, also referred to as "Bingo Carla", who is offered a part in a short film for the New York Lesbian &amp; Gay Film and Video Festival. Later in the evening, the viewer is provided backstage access before a RuPaul dance and vocal performance during "Gay Night" at Mars Bar. The announcement of the passing of Steven Comb, who died from AIDs, was announced. Lastly, we are given the opportunity to experience backstage access after the show with a small cameo of Michael Musto.</p>

            <p>Part one of this video entry provides its audience a chance to construct a vision of nightlife in New York. Nelson and his friends are on their way to The Pyramid Club to catch Lady Bunny's voice performance sets. This specific entry possesses footage of the entire first set and part of the second. Also features a drag performance of First Ladies Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush doing a musical duet of "Bosom Buddies".</p>
            <p>Part two of this video is a continuation of Lady Bunny's second performance at The Pyramid Club, along with a "Sister Dimensions" performance of an original poem. At the end of the show, after recording the ambiance of the backstage area  and entire area of the venue, Sullivan ends his night by recording the streets of New York during his cab ride home, looking out of the windshield and focused on the surrounding neighborhood.</p>
