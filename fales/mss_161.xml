<p><title render="italic">We lay aside letters never to read them again, and at last we destroy them out of discretion, and so disappears the most beautiful, the most immediate breath of life, irrecoverable for ourselves and for others.</title> </p><p>-Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p><p>The estimated death toll of the Second World War (1937-1945), perhaps the most extensively studied event in the twentieth century, is between 50 and 56 million people. This includes democides, military and civilian casualties, and those missing in action throughout all of the war's various theatres. It may seem difficult to imagine "life" in such a deadly and uncertain time, and yet, as these letters mainly written by German Wehrmacht soldiers and their families demonstrate, the everyday, or a nostalgia for it, persisted. Here, a soldier's letter back to his parents might complain about a small ration of sausage, and how his mother's cooking is missed, only to be followed by a letter that details an injury sustained on the front. The "immediate" quality of the letters obviously cannot always be taken at face value. A soldier, aware of the severity of censors, was probably not able to write as freely as he wished. The letters often do not contain as detailed information of military activities as some researchers might wish. Apart from the generally strong sense of <title render="italic">Heimat</title>, political attitudes and statements about the government, especially critical ones that could lead to the death penalty, are infrequently broached directly. Yet, this collection reveals, sometimes strinkingly, the often missing "human" aspect of a seemingly very inhumane time and place - National Socialist Germany. These <title render="italic">Feldpostbriefe</title>[letters from/to the front], though an infinitesmal representation of the 40-50 billion sent and received in Germany throughout WWII, will prove interesting to researchers interested in the Axis from "the bottom up" and in German war correspondence in general.

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The majority of German Correspondence from the World Wars consists of letters to and from German soldiers and their families. The correspondence varies from a brief New Year's postcard to a long letter from the front. There is also correspondence (the only in English) and related ephemera mailed between a young American student, Shirley Messinger, and a young Italian soldier.  There are two small diaries, which include details of the German campaign in the Balkans, of WWII soldier Engelhard Hellmuth. The collection also contains two Soldbuecher (military identification cards), certificates of honor (e.g., Ehrenkreuz für Frontkämpfer), as well as some photographs and newspaper clippings accompanying individual pieces of correspondence.</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES DESCRIPTION</emph> </p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES I: Lappan, Hermann</emph> </p><p>The majority of these letters are from Hermann Lappan to his family. This is the one series in the collection that dates from World War I.</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES II: Berger, Wolfgang</emph> </p><p>The majority of these letters are to and from Wolfgang and Richard Berger and their family.</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES III: Hellmuth, Engelhard</emph> </p><p>Series III contains two diaries of Engelhard Hellmuth, who, in 1942, was a Hauptscharführer [Head Company Leader] (the equivalent of the Wermacht rank of Oberfeldwebel, which is roughly equivalent to the American Master Sergeant) with the S.S., or Schutzstaffel [Protection Unit]. During this time, Hellmuth was involved in the German campaign in the Balkans.</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES IV: Jensen, Kurt</emph> </p><p>Series IV is entirely comprised of letters from Jensen back home to his parents in Schleswig, a city that is between Hamburg and Denmark, closer to the latter. From late January of 1942 to February of 1943, Jensen was on the Russian front. His last letter (April 1, 1945) bears the postmark of Wittenberge, which was bombed by the American Ninth Air Force on April 10 and 12.</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES V: Riedel, Helmut</emph> </p><p>The majority of the letters in this series are to Helmut Riedel, who was an Obergefreiter [Corporal] in World War II. There are also a number of letters addresed to Matrose [Sailor] Riedel. Most letters are from family and freinds in Chemnitz. There are some letters, usually sans envelope, penned by Helmut. There is a large number of letters without a corresponding envelope.</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES VI: Schiavi, Pietro, and Shirley Messinger</emph> </p><p>Series VI contains the letters of a young Italian, Pietro Schiavi, to his Rhode Island penpal, Shirley Messinger. The correspondence of this series is in English, not German. The letters, which date from April 1935 to January 1945, trace Schiavi's trajectory from student to soldier to prisoner of war in Germany. Schivai signs his name first as Pietro, then as Pete and Piero; he also begins to refer to Shirley as Wally. The series contains the various "gifts" that Schiavi sent - a pressed flower, photos, newspaper clippings, and a postcard book. The series also contains memorabilia from Messinger's high school and college (Pembroke) years and a manuscript, "Facts about Pietro Schiavi," which includes an inventory of "Letters Received."</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES VII: Eugen Uhl; Josef (Sepp) Jung</emph> </p><p><emph render="bold">Subseries A: Uhl, Eugen</emph> </p><p>Series VII, Sub-series A contains roughly 450 pieces of correspondence dating from 1936 to 1946, with the majority of the letters dating from 1942 to 1944. The letters center around Eugen and Waldemar Uhl, both of whom were in the German army, and their parents in St. Ingbert (Saar), Ernst and Therese Uhl. Waldemar's last letter home is from June 23, 1941. The letters from Ernst and Therese begin in late 1942; almost all are addressed to Eugen. It appears that Ernst Uhl successfully petitioned for his son Eugen's removal from the front to "[a less dangerous post]" in March of 1943 (see Atbacher, March 18, 1943, and Hauptmann [...], March 22, 1943). The majority of letters in this subseries are between Eugen and his parents.</p><p><emph render="bold">Subseries B: Jung, Josef</emph> </p><p>Interspersed with the Uhl family letters were about 35 letters addressed to Obergefreiter [Corporal] Josef (or Sepp, with the familiar form Seppel, which can be abbreviated as Sepp'l) Jung. No immediate relationship between Jung and Uhl is apparent.</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES VIII: Werle, Jakob</emph> </p><p>The majority of the letters in this series are to Jakob Werle. The remaining letters are addressed either to the Werle Family or sent by Jakob himself. The reader will notice that Werle's hand is radically different in the letter of February 14, 1944 from the military hospital at Wenden due to his injuries from a grenade explosion in Russia. From the German hospital in Wenden, Werle was transferred to a military hospital in Choroszcz, near Bialystok, in Poland. From Poland, he was moved back to Germany, to the hospital at Erfurt, from where his last letter, the latest dated (February 15, 1945) letter in this series, was sent.</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES IX: Zieher, Gottlob</emph> </p><p>With the exception of a single letter, dated February 18, 1943, Gottlob Zieher's correspondence is comprised of letters received. The majority of these are letters from Zieher's siblings, many from Frieda Zieher, who wrote from the family's hometown, Dinkelsbühl. The last letter sent to Zieher, from his sister Lina, is dated August 20, 1944.</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES X: Miscellaneous wartime documents</emph> </p><p>Series X contains miscellaneous items that, at the time of acquisition, were, seemingly arbitrarily, grouped with the correspondence of Gottlob Zieher. These items, labelled as miscellaneous documents, include soldier identification books, certificates of military honor, and an application to the Evangelical church, among others.</p><p><emph render="bold">Oversize</emph> </p><p>All three items placed in oversize are from Series VI: Schiavi and Messinger.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>At the series level, the correspondence is arranged first by its larger historical context (i.e., first World War I, here represented solely by the Lappan correspondence, and then World War II), and then alphabetically by the last name of the soldier by/to whom the correspondence is written.</p><p>At the folder level, correspondence is arranged alphabetically by last name of the writer. When a writer's name is either not present or not at all legible, that writer's correspondence is presented at the end of the series. Each writer's correspondence is presented chronologically in his/her respective folder(s). When an item's date is either not present or not legible, that item is presented at the end of the writer's folder(s).</p><p>Series X contains miscellaneous items that, at the time of acquisition, were, seemingly arbitrarily, grouped with the correspondence of Gottlob Zieher.

Pietro Schiavi, to his Rhode Island penpal, Shirley Messinger. The correspondence of this series is in English, not German. The letters, which date from April 1935 to January 1945, trace Schiavi's trajectory from student to soldier to prisoner of war in Germany. Schivai signs his name first as Pietro, then as Pete and Piero; he also begins to refer to Shirley as Wally. The series contains the various "gifts" that Schiavi sent - a pressed flower, photos, newspaper clippings, and a postcard book. The series also contains memorabilia from Messinger's high school and college (Pembroke) years and a manuscript, "Facts about Pietro Schiavi," which includes an inventory of "Letters Received."</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref260" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Schiavi, Pietro- April 27, 1935- September 18, 1935</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1935</unitdate><container id="aspace_bc13a361cb99d57c1945e3fdee672457" label="Mixed Materials [31142042232747]" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_bc13a361cb99d57c1945e3fdee672457" type="Folder">217</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref261" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Schiavi, Pietro- February 29, 1936- December 14, 1936</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1936</unitdate><container id="aspace_582d06c2079538351d524eb7e8b02ba7" label="Mixed Materials [31142042232747]" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_582d06c2079538351d524eb7e8b02ba7" type="Folder">218</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref262" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Schiavi, Pietro- January 28, 1937- August 17, 1937</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1937</unitdate><container id="aspace_6b6b0c2f716ed43e609b4a4ea2000f40" label="Mixed Materials [31142042232747]" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_6b6b0c2f716ed43e609b4a4ea2000f40" type="Folder">219</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref263" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Schiavi, Pietro- September 23, 1937</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1937</unitdate><container id="aspace_3144085cc85441837ebacbdceff401a6" label="Mixed Materials [31142042232747]" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_3144085cc85441837ebacbdceff401a6" type="Folder">220</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref264" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Schiavi, Pietro- December 18, 1937- April 28, 1939</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1937-1939</unitdate><container id="aspace_1ed81a0b9a72a1d0df7430ef67c76de5" label="Mixed Materials [31142042232747]" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_1ed81a0b9a72a1d0df7430ef67c76de5" type="Folder">221</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref265" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Schiavi, Pietro- July 9, 1939- November 24, 1939</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1939</unitdate><container id="aspace_f308a534b1ca17d9062d66dc474b9347" label="Mixed Materials [31142042232747]" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_f308a534b1ca17d9062d66dc474b9347" type="Folder">222</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref266" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Schiavi, Pietro- December 6, 1939- January 31, 1945</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1939-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_7b5d8780e45edf54ac931e6838aeb88d" label="Mixed Materials [31142042232747]" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_7b5d8780e45edf54ac931e6838aeb88d" type="Folder">223</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref267" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Schedule for Freshmen and Transfer Students, Pembroke College, Brown University, October 27- November 3, 1943</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1943</unitdate><container id="aspace_6a6b643c08abfc47e334bc93ef63170d" label="Mixed Materials [31142042232754]" type="Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_6a6b643c08abfc47e334bc93ef63170d" type="Folder">224</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref268" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Miniature Flyer for a production of "A Foul Plot That Failed" by the G.P.

The letters center around Eugen and Waldemar Uhl, both of whom were in the German army, and their parents in St. Ingbert (Saar), Ernst and Therese Uhl. Waldemar's last letter home is from June 23, 1941. The letters from Ernst and Therese begin in late 1942; almost all are addressed to Eugen. It appears that Ernst Uhl successfully petitioned for his son Eugen's removal from the front to "[a less dangerous post]" in March of 1943 (see Atbacher, March 18, 1943, and Hauptmann [...], March 22, 1943). The majority of letters in this subseries are between Eugen and his parents. Interspersed with the Uhl family letters were about 35 letters addressed to Obergefreiter [Corporal] Josef (or Sepp, with the familiar form Seppel, which can be abbreviated as Sepp'l) Jung. No immediate relationship between Jung and Uhl is apparent. These 35 letters compose Sub-series B.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref286" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries A: Eugen Uhl</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref287" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>A[]bacher, J.; Major, Batl. 12- March 18, 1943</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1943</unitdate><container id="aspace_88e23a37178852368457f10faa5b96f3" label="Mixed Materials [31142042232762]" type="Box">9</container><container parent="aspace_88e23a37178852368457f10faa5b96f3" type="Folder">241</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref288" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Benesch, Eberhard- October 13, 1943</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1943</unitdate><container id="aspace_a2160a23ac10486e9bdc934da31c1dfb" label="Mixed Materials [31142042232762]" type="Box">9</container><container parent="aspace_a2160a23ac10486e9bdc934da31c1dfb" type="Folder">242</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref289" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Hauptmann and Kompaniefuhrer of Batl. 12, 2.

The remaining letters are addressed either to the Werle Family or sent by Jakob himself. The reader will notice that Werle's hand is radically different in the letter of February 14, 1944 from the military hospital at Wenden due to his injuries from a grenade explosion in Russia. From the German hospital in Wenden, Werle was transferred to a military hospital in Choroszcz, near Bialystok, in Poland. From Poland, he was moved back to Germany, to the hospital at Erfurt, from where his last letter, the latest dated (February 15, 1945) letter in this series, was sent.</p></scopecontent><c
