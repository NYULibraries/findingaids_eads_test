    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Coca Crystal (1947-2016), born Jacquline "Jackie" Diamond, was a journalist, television personality, and political activist. Beginning in 1969, Diamond contributed to the <emph render="italic">East Village Other</emph> under the pen name Coca Crystal, writing about counterculture and politics with a strong focus on women's issues. In 1975, Diamond adopted her sister's young son, Gustav "Gus" Che Finkelstein. </p><p>In 1977, she created the cable-access variety television program <emph render="italic">The Coca Crystal Show: If I Can't Dance, You Can Keep Your Revolution</emph>, which ran until 1995. The<emph render="italic">Coca Crystal Show</emph> featured political commentary, music, guest interviews, and audience call-ins. Some of the show's sketches included Sinsemilla Stret: The World's Only Consumer Video Pot Report, Radical Walking Tours with Bruce Kayton, Newt News, No Nukes, and Archive Tapes. The show usually began with Coca Crystal lighting a joint and ended with her and the show's guests dancing together. Regular contributers included photojournalist Charlie Frick, music journalist Leslie Kandell, Pam Lloyd, poet Vincent Titus, journalist Nancy Borman, Mike Chance, Bud Bogart, Lannes Kenfield, poet Tuli Kupferberg, journalist Jim Buckley, talent coordinator Maureen Ivice, Marty Brown, activist Bruce Kayton, environmental educator Steve "Wildman" Brill, director Ed Caraballo, Beanie the dog, and Judith Malina, Steve Ben Israel, and Jasmine Vegas of "The Living Theatre." Gus Finkelstein also made several appearances on the show and was often referred to as the "executive producer."</p><p>In 2012, the Metropolitan Playhouse awarded a Certificate of Appreciation to Coca Crystal. In 2013, Danielle Quisenberry portrayed Crystal in a one-woman show performed for the East Village Theater Festival at the Metropolitan Playhouse. </p><p>Coca Crystal passed away in 2016, 10 years after being diagnosed with lung cancer.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At the time of accessioning in 2016, materials were rehoused in archival boxes. In 2021, the collection was further arranged and described by an archivist. At this time, 16 U-matic tapes were temporarily separated from the collection due to mold concerns. The cases of the remaining videotapes were lightly cleaned to reduce dust and risk of contamination. Several dirty or broken cases were replaced, and photo documentation was retained of the tapes' original housing.</p><p>In 2022 the moldy U-matic tapes that were isolated in 2021 were cleaned by Preservation staff. These items are currently isolated from other items by housing them in a polyethylene bag with a desiccated board and RH monitor strip. If this strip indicates an RH greater than 50%, contact the Preservation Department immediately. Do not open this packaging without contacting the Preservation Department.</p>  </processinfo>
