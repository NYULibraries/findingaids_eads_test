    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Mabou Mines is a collaborative, avant-garde theater company based in New York City. Founded in 1970, the company took its name from an old mining town in northern Nova Scotia, near where founding members JoAnne Akalaitis, Lee Breuer, Philip Glass, Ruth Maleczech, and David Warrilow, developed <emph render="italic">The Red Horse Animation</emph>, the group's first original performance piece. Since then Mabou Mines has produced scores of plays, collaborated with well-known writers, musicians, visual artists, and filmmakers, garnered heaps of critical praise and awards, and performed around the globe, cementing its reputation as an innovative force in the theater world. The company's official website is maboumines.org.

Lee Breuer and Ruth Maleczech met studying theater at UCLA in the late 1950s. Around 1960, the couple hitchhiked to San Francisco to participate in the city's active theater scene. Working at the San Francisco Actor's Workshop and the San Francisco Mime Troupe they met Bill Raymond, and at the San Francisco Tape Music Center they met JoAnne Akalaitis. In 1964 Akalaitis moved to New York City but left for Paris soon after with composer (and future husband) Philip Glass. The following year Breuer and Maleczech left San Francisco for Europe. The two couples met up while traveling in Greece, went back to Paris, and with actor David Warrilow, began to work on staging Samuel Beckett's <emph render="italic">Play</emph>. It premiered at the American Cultural Center in 1967. It was also in Paris that the group first met actor Frederick Neumann. In 1969, back in New York with Glass, Akalaitis wrote the others in Paris suggesting they form a theater group in New York.

"Mabou Mines came together as a group to create formal works that would explore language and acting. They had a strong desire to collectively exercise complete artistic control over the work."1 Influenced especially by Jerzy Grotowski's teaching and Beckett's work, Mabou Mines went on to produce experimental theater pieces like Breuer's <emph render="italic">Red Horse Animation</emph>pieces that resulted from intense collaboration and improvisation, and incorporated elements of visual art, dance, mime, puppetry, and music. <emph render="italic">Arc Welding Piece</emph> (1972), for example, featured an artist using an arc welder to make cuts in a large piece of metal, while actors expressed various states of emotion, their faces enlarged by magnifying lenses. In 1974, Fred Neumann joined the group to work on Breuer's second "Animation," <emph render="italic">The B. Beaver Animation</emph>. Bill Raymond joined shortly thereafter.

In its early years, Mabou Mines moved easily between the art world and the theater, often performing in galleries as well as stages. But its work with Beckett's writing firmly situated the group within a theatrical context. "Mabou Mines has produced eight pieces by Samuel Beckett [ <emph render="italic">Cascando, Come and Go, Company, Imagination Dead Imagine, The Lost Ones, Mercier and Camier, Play, Worstward Ho</emph>], six of which have been world premieres of texts not originally written for the theatre. These productions have led to Mabou Mines being considered one of the foremost interpreters of Beckett's work."2 After an early residency at La Mama Experimental Theatre Club in New York, the company began performing at Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater, and other venues in New York and elsewhere.

From the beginning, creative roles were fluid and collaboration was key, but Lee Breuer served as the company's primary director. In 1975 however, Akalaitis directed <emph render="italic">Cascando</emph> and opened the door for other members to take on new roles, for the company to expand, and for multiple projects to come together simultaneously. Akalaitis went on to direct <emph render="italic">Dressed Like an Egg </emph>(1977) and <emph render="italic">Southern Exposure </emph>(1979), and wrote and directed <emph render="italic">Dead End Kids </emph> (1980); Neumann directed <emph render="italic">Mercier and Camier </emph>(1979); Maleczech directed <emph render="italic">Vanishing Pictures </emph>(1980). Other performers worked with Mabou Mines, including L.B. Dallas, Linda Hartinian, Ellen McElduff, Greg Mehrten, Terry O'Reilly, and B-St. John Schofield.

The company steadily expanded its repertoire and continued its tradition of collaboration, working with talented performers and artists, including composers Bob Telson, John Zorn, Pauline Oliveros, and David Byrne. Mabou Mines has adapted works by Shakespeare ( <emph render="italic">Lear</emph>, 1990), Franz Xaver Kroetz ( <emph render="italic">Through the Leaves</emph>, 1984; <emph render="italic">Help Wanted</emph>, 1986), Philip K. Dick ( <emph render="italic">Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said</emph>, 1985), and Bertolt Brecht ( <emph render="italic">In the Jungle of Cities</emph>, 1991). The company has toured extensively in the United States and abroad.

Mabou Mines has remained committed to its ideal of complete artistic control. "All decisions, artistic and administrative, large and small, are made by the company members, and each member functions variously as producer, designer, actor, writer, or director for the other. Additionally all participate as members of the Board of Directors."3

As the company stated in a 1990 press kit, "The artistic purpose of Mabou Mines has been and remains the creation of new theatre pieces from original texts and the theatrical use of existing texts staged from a specific point of view. Each member is encouraged to pursue his or her artistic vision by initiating and collaborating on a wide range of projects of varying styles, developing them from initial concept to final performance. This process is intense and often lengthy. While the director of a Mabou Mines work is responsible for its concept and its basic structure, the ultimate production reflects the concerns and the artistic input of all its collaborators."4

Other size prints, contact sheets, negatives, color snapshots, and photographers' labels make up the rest of Series IV. Most prints and contact sheets are clearly marked with the photographer's name. For each folder in Series IV the photographer is listed directly below the name of the production, where applicable. Some folders contain the work of two or more photographers. In these folders the (un-labeled) negatives were rehoused in plastic sleeves, and the original labeled sleeve was retained and placed behind the negative. Oversize photographs are housed in Box 31.

Generally, this means the work of individual photographers is grouped, and prints usually appear before negatives or contact sheets.

id="aspace_2ea3bd17b54860c844b1c99ce91031dd"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This series comprises records of Mabou Mines performances outside of New York City, including multi-state and international tours. The bulk of the series spans the 1980s into the early 1990s. <lb/><emph render="bold">Subseries A</emph> contains files relating to specific performances or tours of specific productions. <emph render="italic">Cold Harbor</emph> is especially well-represented here, as this production toured extensively in the mid-1980s. Most of the folders in Subseries A contain some combination of the following materials: correspondence with representatives of a venue; tour schedules and itineraries; contact information of cast, crew, and venue; financial records including budgets; contracts; programs and flyers; lighting plots, track sheets, and cues; ground plans and stage schematics of various venues; maps and other travel information. The folders are arranged chronologically by performance date. The files within each folder may date to several months before and/or after the performance date. This arrangement clearly shows that it was not unusual for several Mabou Mines productions to tour simultaneously. There is significant overlap with the materials in <emph render="bold">Series III: Production Files</emph>, and this subseries can be compared with <emph render="bold">Series II: Programs</emph> for a more complete record of Mabou Mines performances. <lb/><emph render="italic">Subseries B, General Touring Files</emph>, comprises similar material (correspondence, financial records, technical specifications, etc) related to no production in particular, or related to many different productions. This series is rich in what the company called "touring inquiries." <emph render="bold">Subseries C</emph> contains information on travel discounts including airline miles programs, and information on travel and lodging in specific cities. <emph render="bold">Subseries D</emph> contains Mabou Mines' collection of information on various national and international theater organizations and festivals, some in which Mabou Mines took part. These folders are arranged in alphabetical order by organization, then by festival.</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_4e0ffeb6dbec58e8e25198a9aa99039f"><head>General</head><p>Boxes stored offsite:

There are original newspaper clippings, photocopies of clippings, magazine and journal articles, press releases, production histories, programs, and other related material. The material is arranged chronologically by subject. The series is divided into three subseries. The first part of Subseries A comprises pieces written about Mthe abou Mines company generally, and the second half comprises press about the company's awards and nominations. Subseries B is made up of press about individual company members and associates. The members are listed first, alphabetically, followed by the associates. Subseries C, the bulk of Series X, contains press and other material related to Mabou Mines productions and productions associated with Mabou Mines. The Mabou Mines plays are listed first, alphabetically by title, followed by the related productions.</p><p>When the collection was maintained by Mabou Mines, the newspaper reviews for some productions had been individually foldered and each given a rating based on its favorability. This rating system was expressed through the use of color-coded circle stickers attached to the tops of some folders. Rave reviews were given red or orange stickers, yellow stickers were for mixed reviews, and black were for negative reviews. Presumably, this enabled those working at Mabou Mines to quickly determine the general critical opinion of a given performance, and also served as a shortcut to finding reviews from which to pull quotes for press releases, advertisements, etc. This rating system was not retained when the collection was processed at Fales Library for the following reasons: (1) the researcher is better served if several reviews of a performance are collected into a single folder; (2) the rating system was not uniformly applied; (3) some colored stickers had fallen off before the series was processed; (4) a reader can distinguish a rave from a pan.</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_2e69293b1bc400de403cb7f3eb16d9bc"><head>General</head><p>Boxes stored offsite:
