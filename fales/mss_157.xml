    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Sarah Jacobson was born in Norwalk, Connecticut in 1971. Her family moved to Edina, Minnesota, where Jacobson graduated from high school. As a teenager, Sarah Jacobson was drawn to the independent film and music scene in Minneapolis. After graduating from Edina High School in 1989, Sarah Jacobson attended Bard College for her freshman year. Dissatisfied with Bard, Jacobson moved to San Francisco to attend the San Francisco Art Institute where she met her mentor, George Kuchar.</p><p>While still in film school, Sarah Jacobson wrote, produced and directed her first films including, <emph render="italic">The Adventures of Sweet Miss: The Disco Years</emph> and <emph render="italic">I Was A Teenage Serial Killer.</emph> Shortly after graduating from college, Jacobson, wrote, directed and produced her first feature-length film, <emph render="italic">Mary Jane's Not A Virgin Anymore</emph>, which screened internationally. Sarah Jacobson was a firm believer in "DIY" or the "Do It Yourself" method of filmmaking. With her mother, Ruth Jacobson, she established her own production company, Station Wagon Productions, to handle the distribution of her film projects in keeping with the "DIY" manifesto. Jacobson also did some commercial work for VH1, Oxygen Media and is known to have shot at least one music video for the British punk band Fluffy. Sarah Jacobson's influences include filmakers George Kuchar, Jim Jarmusch, Susan Seidelman, John Hughes, Tamra Davis, Alison Anders, and the musical groups Babes In Toyland, Heavens to Betsy, L7 and Gas Huffer.</p><p>In addition to her film projects, Jacobson did freelance writing for several publications including <emph render="italic">YM</emph>,<emph render="italic">Sassy</emph>,<emph render="italic">Film Threat</emph>,<emph render="italic">Punk Planet</emph> and<emph render="italic">Filth.</emph> Sarah Jacobson also considered herself an activist, not only through her own film work and teaching but through her involvement with 50/50, a feminist collective that sought to attain gender equality in the film and televison industry.</p><p>Sarah Jacobson passed away on February 13th, 2004 due to uterine cancer. Before her death, Jacobson was developing <emph render="italic">Sleaze</emph>, a film chronicling the life of a 15-year-old girl who hooks up with an all-girl rock band touring Missoula, Montana. Sleaze appears to be inspired by the film, <emph render="italic">Ladies and Gentlemen the Fabulous Stains</emph> (Written by Nancy Dowd and Directed by Lou Alder) for which Jacobson made a short documentary. Her last films included a documentary about her 10-year high school reunion and <emph render="italic">True Love Mohawk</emph>, documenting Jacobson and her boyfriend, Aaron Zisman giving each other mohawks.</p><p><emph render="bold">Filmography</emph></p><p>I Was A Teenage Serial Killer (1993)</p><p>Mary Jane's Not A Virgin Anymore (1997)</p><p>The Making of Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains (2000)</p><p><emph render="bold">Other Film and Video Works</emph></p><p>Sweet Miss: the Disco Years, (1988) (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRCjfvgWk5A)</p><p>Road Trip, or What I Learned in a Buick Station Wagon, (1991) (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLj0ot1Oa_s)</p><p>Fluffy (Music Video), (undated) (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDz_DUchZ80)</p><p>Man or Astroman?

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Sarah G. Jacobson Papers include production materials from her independent film projects, freelance writing, activism work, teaching and commercial work. Material types include film production materials, writing, clippings, audio-cassettes, video recordings, films, flyers, fanzines and artifacts. The bulk of the collection relates to Jacobson's professional career, primarily the production of her films <emph render="italic">Mary Jane's Not A Virgin Anymore</emph> and <emph render="italic">I Was A Teenage Serial Killer.</emph> However, the collection also contains material related to a number of Jacobson's smaller film projects such as <emph render="italic">The Adventures of Sweet Miss: The Disco Years</emph>, <emph render="italic">Sleaze</emph>, a music video for the british punk band, Fluffy, and a documentary film about the making of Lou Alder's feature, <emph render="italic">Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains.</emph></p><p>In addition to film projects, the collection contains clippings, audio recordings and notes relating to Jacobson's work with VH1, Oxygen Media, and 50/50 Women Filmmaker's Summit (now called MoviesByWomen.com). Jacobson's freelance writing dates back to at least 1992 when she started writing for independent fanzines and underground film and music publications such as <emph render="italic">Filth</emph> and <emph render="italic">Film Threat.</emph> Jacobson also wrote for more commercial publications such as <emph render="italic">Sassy</emph> and <emph render="italic">YM</emph></p><p>Sarah Jacobson collected a variety of films on tape, news clippings, and fanzines from others that are organized according to artist/ filmmaker or subject. Many of the subjects represented in this portion of the collection relate to Jacobson's professional and personal social circle. Some materials come from filmakers Jacobson was in contact with or inspired by such as Tamra Davis, Allison Anders and her mentor and teacher George Kuchar. Other collection materials include clippings about 1990s pop-culture phenomena, such as the musical bands Hole and Nirvana and television personalities Roseanne and Shannen Doherty.</p><p>The 2008 accretion consists of a larger group of material related to the original accession, specifically items related to Jacobson's professional contributions to film and journalism. In addition, this accretion includes a new series consisting of items related to Jacobson's student life, including classwork and notebooks ranging from her elementary to collegiate education.</p><p>
The 2018 accretion contains personal notebooks from 1987 to 2004 as well as her published work on modern film and photography from mulitiple Sundance Film Festivals and the production of <emph render="italic">Mary Jane's Not A Virgin Anymore</emph>.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The Sarah G. Jacobson Papers are arranged chronologically by project. In some cases materials are arranged alphabetically. Every attempt was made to preserve the original order of the material.

The 2018 accretion has not been arranged by an archivist. The materials are arranged in the order in which they were received from the donor.</p>    <list type="ordered">
