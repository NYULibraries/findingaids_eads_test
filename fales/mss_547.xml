    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Suzanne Harris Papers (1960-2014) is composed of paper and audiovisual materials documenting Harris' life and work as an artist and arts educator. The collection contains materials created and collected by Harris and documents her artistic processes and output, as well as her installations and exhibitions held in the United States, mainly in New York City, as well as abroad in locations including France, Germany, and Italy. </p><p>Materials in this collection include photographic documentation of her exhibitions including negatives, slides, and prints; press clippings and reviews of exhibitions in various publications; lecture notes and course syllabi; proposals for projects including artist statements, project summaries, and proposed budgets; original art, paintings, drawings, and sketches; original writings; exhibition ephemera and administrative papers; documents relating to the posthumous sale and use of Harris' works; as well as recordings of her performances and projects. Together, these materials highlight the types of exhibitions Harris created and participated in, her various inspirations for art pieces, the types of classes she was teaching, and the ways in which she was perceived by her colleagues and critics. Personal photographs of Suzanne Harris, her friends, and colleagues also provide insight about her private life. </p><p>The Suzanne Harris Papers contain materials related to sculptor Jene Highstein and art curator Glenda Hydler -- both of whom were Harris' colleagues and close friends. Monographs focused upon Highstein's work and career, as well as some reviews of his works are included in the collections. Glenda Hydler's posters, which she made for Harris, and personal notes that mainly address Harris' death are also included. The collection contains correspondence between Harris and Hydler that address both personal and business affairs, as well as personal photographs of Harris, Highstein, and Hydler. Between 1974 and 1975, Harris and Hydler recorded conversations addressing topics such as secrets and interpersonal relationships. Those conversations can be found in the collection. Throughout the 1970s, Harris recorded videos, some of which featured Highstein and Harris. Audiovisual projects found within the collection have been listed with the original titles found on their containers.</p><p>The collection also contains some materials related to Harris' ex-husband, Paul Harris, including descriptions of their horoscopes and photographs of the couple. Paul Harris was a musician and worked as a keyboard player. He was featured on two studio albums, <emph render="italic">Down the Road</emph> by Manhassas and the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band's self-titled album. Copies of both vinyl records can be found within this collection. </p><p>Finally, the Suzanne Harris Papers contain various objects belonging to Harris including glass jars, a silver spoon, bells, a glass ash tray, a tambourine, remnants of a drum, pencil cases, and some pieces of clothing. The origins of these items is unknown. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At the time of accessioning materials were rehoused in archival boxes and folders, and described on the collection-level.</p><p>The Suzanne Harris Papers was processed and described by an archivist in the spring of 2023. Materials were placed in new archival folders and boxes. Original folder titles were retained when possible and materials were then arranged alphabetically by file title.  Related materials were grouped together intelllectually and physically, when possible. Photographs, negatives, and slides were removed from their original housing and placed into archival sleeves. Duplicate and commercially published materials were removed from the collection and returned to the donor. A large portion of the audiovisual materials found in the collection were treated for mold, stabilized, and rehoused by New York University's Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department.</p><p>New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. Five optical discs containing audio files were forensically imaged and analyzed using Exact Audio Copy.</p><p>Two half inch video reels housed in Box 15 were identified as moldy on April 19, 2023. These items are currently isolated from other items by housing them in a polyethylene bag with a desiccated board and RH monitor strip. If this strip indicates an RH greater than 50%, contact the Preservation Department immediately. Do not open this packaging without contacting the Preservation Department. One audiocassette housed in Shared Fales Box 094, ten half inch video reels housed in Box 15, and five quarter inch audio reels housed in Box 15 were also surface cleaned for mold and were rehoused into archival cases.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Suzanne Harris (1940-1979) was a New York City-based artist whose work has been exhibited domestically and internationally. Before becoming an artist, Harris studied medicine. In the early 1970s, she moved to New York City and became a member of SoHo's 112 Greene Street experimental artistic community. 112 Greene Street was an exhibition and performance space located inside an abandoned SoHo factory. All artists were welcome to use the space as long as they were willing to install and dismantle their own work. Throughout the 1970s, Suzanne Harris exhibited several performances, such as <emph render="italic">Flying Machines</emph>, and art pieces, such as <emph render="italic">Steel Pipes</emph>, at 112 Greene Street. As an artist, Harris was interested in the movement of the human body and explored this through dance. She performed alongside dancers Steve Paxton, Trisha Brown, and others. She was also interested in sculpture and created art installations including <emph render="italic">Locus Up One</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Tower of Power</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Sunstroak</emph>. In addition to being a working artist, Suzanne Harris was also an arts educator and taught a Sensory Awareness course at the Pratt Institute in New York City.</p>  </bioghist>
