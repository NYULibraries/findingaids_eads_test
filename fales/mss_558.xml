Also included is any press on Rosenblum as a director, producer, writer, or her career in general, and membership materials to various organizations, such as the Directors Guild of America. These materials, especially related to career retrospectives, illustrate the important contributions that Rosenblum has made, in terms of gender and subject matter, to the documentary film industry.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_53fe29f9d8ae8a8c199fca6013012c70"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_c7e27f0dbe1b32dccd5c1b73e8a0ac84" level="file"><did><unittitle>Film Festivals</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/1013004</unitid></did><c id="aspace_1357ea992db5712d1596ad73da88f7e5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Electronic Records -- Photographs, Poster, and Video Recording</unittitle><unitid>FA_MSS_558_ER_21</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/1014906</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2007/2018" type="inclusive">2007-2018</unitdate><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/material-request-placeholder" xlink:role="electronic-records-reading-room" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Electronic Records -- Photographs, Poster, and Video Recording" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Electronic Records -- Photographs, Poster, and Video Recording</p></daodesc></dao></did></c><c id="aspace_11441899f96a73bf8fc3705713474fee" level="file"><did><unittitle>General Participation and Attendance</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/1013008</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1984/2009" type="inclusive">1984-2009</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

It focuses on the the Nancy Figuerora hospital ward and the incarcerated individual James Mirabel, who was born in a prison and later died in one. Materials related to the film's production, marketing, and screening include a scrapbook, poster, photographs and negatives, and film elements (such as master copies, audio interviews, and certain scenes) on various media. <emph render='italic'>Beat Down</emph> follows Raymond Alvarez, another incarcerated individual at Rikers Island who was the victim of correctional officers' brutality.

The film focuses on the impact of the Rockefeller Mandatory Minimum Drug Laws on families and communities in New York City. It follows a group called The Mothers of the New York Disappeared and Terrence Stevens, a former incarcerated individual who served nine years of a 15-to-life sentence before being granted clemency. Materials related to the production, marketing, and screening of the documentary consist of press, contracts, a scrapbook, film elements (such as interviews; specific scenes; and eight-, nine-, and 15-minute versions) on various media, and research materials (including videos on the Rockefeller Drug Program). Also included in the series are materials related to In Arms Reach, a community organization founded in 2002 by Terrence Stevens to support economically challenged youth, especially those impacted by incarceration. Materials include various video and audio recordings by Rosenblum (who also served as a teacher and informal advisor to the program), informational material (such as brochures) about the organization, and photographs.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_c122c89c2fa885b684deaf76dafa4630"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically into four subseries and alphanumerically within each one.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ef76d17768ab7eb2a7b535f10dd00d17" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries XIII.A.

Additionally, there are two tribute films made for friends and colleagues of Rosenblum. Materials related to the early, incomplete, and unidentified films cover topics and figures such as Ann Ligouri, a sports broadcaster; bodybuilding; same-sex marriage; and the artwork of Tommy Tune. Materials include research files (such as articles, legal case files, and correspondence), film clips, photographs, and interviews. The tribute films honor Bill Miles, who co-produced and co-directed <emph render='italic'>Liberators</emph> and <emph render='italic'>The Untold West: Black West</emph>, and Dennis Watlington, who wrote and co-produced <emph render='italic'>The Untold West: Black West</emph> and wrote <emph render='italic'>Twin Lenses</emph>. Materials related to these tributes consist of biographical information (such as resumes), video recordings of Miles's other films, video recordings of Watlington's book tour, and, in the case of Miles, a memorial program.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_ce4678b6f9a87e08e6bdd1e3a3742564"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically by topic and alphanumerically within each
