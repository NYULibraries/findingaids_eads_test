Taylor Papers primarily document the management of the Frederieke Taylor Gallery through paper and electronic files on artists, exhibitions, and administrative files. A significant portion of the paper collection is the gallery's artist information files dating from 1990 to 2010. This collection also includes chronological gallery exhibition material; administrative files; business contact cards; and appointment calendars from the 1970s to the mid-2010s. A small amount of material related to Taylor's early exhibition curating in the 1970s and images from her own personal art collection can also be found in this collection.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Frederieke Taylor (1940-2018) was an art collector, curator, and administrator who exhibited contemporary art at the gallery she co-founded in SoHo in 1993. In the 1960s, she immigrated from the Netherlands. Taylor worked as director for the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire and directed the Skowhegan School for Painting and Sculpture. Taylor also curated and organized exhibitions, and coordinated "Deconstructivist Architecture" at the Museum of Modern Art in 1988. In 1993, Taylor opened TZ'Art, a gallery in SoHo, with a partner, Tom Zollner.  After five years, Taylor took over sole ownership and renamed it the Frederieke Taylor Gallery. The artists, sculptors, and architects exhibited at the gallery include Lisa Sigal, Thomas Zummer, Mel Chin, Raimund Abraham, Long-Bin Chen and Meredith Monk.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Loose items were grouped and foldered together when necessary, while keeping original order. All material was reboxed into acid-free containers. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
Audiovisual material was removed from existing boxes and housed separately. Born-digital material was also separated from their original boxes, information was added into medialog, each item was assigned a number, and labeled. 
<lb/>
Binders containing artist and exhibition material within plastic sleeves were deassembled, while keeping the original order and foldered.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Born-digital material was inventoried, labeled, and imaged. Discs were processed using Forensic Toolkit, and video and audio were imaged and uploaded to permanent storage. A portion of the discs were deaccessioned due to duplication, or too damaged to open. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains paper and digital files, an archived website, and audiovisual recordings related to the Frederieke Taylor Gallery. The gallery represented artists, sculptors, and architects, including Lisa Sigal, Thomas Zummer, Mel Chin, Raimund Abraham, Long-Bin Chen, and Meredith Monk. A significant portion of the paper files in this collection contain artist material assembled by the gallery for those artists they represented. These binders date from the 1980s to mid-2010s and typically contain an artist's resume and statement; press clippings; and paper and digital images of their artwork. Similar artist material can also be found within the gallery's digital administrative files which contain gallery emails; client lists; art fair files; advertising; and content for the gallery's online blog. The small number of audiovisual materials within this collection were either provided by the artist to promote their work, or were used as part of a gallery exhibition. 
The gallery also assembled binders containing material from their exhibitions, dating from 1993 to 2010 which includes lists of artworks, promotional material, catalogs, and press clippings. Gallery administrative material includes paper and digital files containing promotional material; exhibition catalogs; notebooks containing daily tasks and artist studio visit notes; images of the gallery space; exhibition guest books; business contact cards; and appointment calendars dating from 1974 to 2015. Files on Taylor's curatorial work in the late 1970s while working with the Institute of Architecture and Urban Studies are in this collection. This collection also contains digital images and supporting documentation for Taylor's personal art collection.</p>  </scopecontent>
