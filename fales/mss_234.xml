      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Explorers Club was founded in 1904 in New York City and is an international multidisciplinary professional society dedicated to the advancement of field research and the ideal that it is vital to preserve the instinct to explore. </p>
      <p>In May 1904, a group of men active in exploration met at the request of Henry Collins Walsh, to form an organization to unite explorers in fellowship and to promote the work of exploration. A subsequent dinner held on May 28, 1904 in New York City was attended by fifty men well known in exploration, and at this dinner the Explorers Club was organized.</p>
      <p>In 1905 the first regular meeting of the Club's members was held.  Beginning soon after, the Club began to invite both explorers returning from the field and visiting scientists to tell of their experiences. This informal practice soon developed into the smoker-lecture illustrated talks of the 1930s and 1940s.  Annual dinners have continued to be held since the original event in 1904 and provide an opportunity for the Club to honor significant achievements and review the year in exploration. </p>
      <p>Currently, the Explorers Club promotes the scientific exploration of land, sea, air, and space by supporting research and education in the physical, natural and biological sciences. The Club provides expedition resources including funding, online information, and member-to-member consultation. The Club's annual dinners honor accomplishments in exploration and field sciences. The Explorers Club actively encourages public interest in exploration and the sciences through its public lectures program, publications, travel programs, and other events.  </p>
