    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Laura Foreman was a dancer, choreographer, visual artist, writer and director of dance at New School University. She lived and worked in New York City from the mid-1960s until her death. <lb/><lb/>Foreman worked primarily in dance for the first decade of her time in Manhattan, operating both the Laura Foreman Dance Company and Composers' and Choreographers' Theatre with her husband, John Watts. In the late 1970s she began working in more abstract performance and visual art. Perhaps her most well-known piece was 1981's "Wallwork," a collaboration with Watts which took the form of a rigorous advertising campaign for a nonexistent performance.<lb/><lb/> After Watts's death in 1982, Foreman's work shifted towards visual art and writing. She created an extensive sculpture series, "Birdhouse as Metaphor," which consisted of numerous functional and non-functional birdhouses and showed in 1990 at Souyun Yi Gallery. In 1997, <emph render="italic">Close Encounters</emph>, a volume of Foreman's short stories, was published by Outloud Books.<lb/> Foreman died of cancer in Manhattan in 2001.<lb/><lb/>Source:<lb/>Dunning, Jennifer.
