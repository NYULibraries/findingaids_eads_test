    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Arleen Schloss (born 1943) is a New York City based poet, visual, performance, video, and film artist. An influential figure in the Downtown New York scene, she is known for her interdisciplinary loft space, A's, as well as her involvement in Danceteria, The Storefront of Art and Architecture, and the No Se No Social Club at the Rivington School.</p><p>Schloss attended the Parsons School of Design from 1961-1964 and attained a Bachelors of Education from New York University in 1967. She taught art at New York public elementary schools from the 1960s-1990s. In her own words, her framework of  "teaching the alphabet with sound poetics and improvised chance operations" was a source of inspiration for her art. In her early educational and artistic career, Schloss lived in a building with other artists, including Merce Cunningham and Ray Kelly, with whom she began to organize workshops and parties (<emph render="italic">Bowery Artist Tribute</emph>, The New Museum).</p><p>Circle K Ranch began in 1971 as weekly "performance parties" organized by Ray Kelly, Bill Dunas of the Ambrose Art Foundation, and Arleen Schloss. In 1978, Schloss and R.L. Seltzman organized Performance Art Workshops on Monday evenings. From this came A's on a regular weekly basis, often referred to as "Wednesdays at A's" and "Saturday Night at A's." This experimental space at Schloss' 330 Broome Street loft was open to local and international interdisciplinary artists interested in collaborating and working with live audiences. Early participants included Claire Fergusson, Joe Lewis, Kirsten Hawthorne, Jean Allen as Boo the Clown, Mania D, and Tod Jorgensen. The first band to play at A's was Grey, Jean-Michel Basquiat's band. Posters for A's events were also the result of artistic collaborations, and were exhibited across Europe including at the Vienna Biennale and Art Basel in Switzerland.</p><p>As she was hosting these parties and workshops throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Schloss also performed some of her most well known works. These include <emph render="italic">Shot Dot Shot</emph> and  <emph render="italic">A Shot Chance</emph> (The Kitchen, 1977), <emph render="italic">Its A at MoMA</emph> (The Museum of Modern Art, 1978), <emph render="italic">AAA</emph> (Robert Freidus Gallery, 1978), The Staten Island Ferry Diamond Jubilee in 1980, <emph render="italic">How She Sees It By Her</emph> (various venues in New York City and Montreal, 1982), <emph render="italic">Performance A-Z</emph> (Storefront for Art and Architecture, 1982), <emph render="italic">The Letterwoman Show</emph> (Shuttle Theatre, 1984), <emph render="italic">A.E. Bla Bla Bla</emph> (Ars Electronica, 1986), and <emph render="italic">Loveletters</emph> (The Museum of Modern Art, 1987). </p><p>During this time, Schloss toured around the world to present her work at festivals and galleries. Her trips included a European tour in the early 1980s with performances in London, Berlin, Munich, Düsseldorf, Amsterdam, and Brussels; a trip to Japan in 1987 to study language, characters, and sounds, which culminated in video exhibitions and "Peace on Earth," a light and sound environment piece; a trip to China in 1992 with Asian American artists, where she presented a media workshop at the Hong Kong Art Center and collaborated with the Peking Opera in Taiwan; a 1993 residency in Bremen, Germany, where she taught multimedia and fine arts at Hochschule für Kunste; a trip to South Korea in 1997 to participate in the Nine Dragon Heads International Environment Art Festival and Symposium; and repeated trips to Linz, Austria throughout the 1980s and 1990s to participate in the Ars Electronica Festival.</p><p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Schloss also ran a video production studio in her loft, Studio A, and produced several works of film and television. Schloss' films include <emph render="italic">30 Seconds</emph> (1983), <emph render="italic">Glenn Branca Symphony No. 4 / Physics</emph> (1984), <emph render="italic">It's A Live Laser</emph> (1985), <emph render="italic">A National Geographic</emph> (1989), <emph render="italic">Sun Daze Away</emph> (circa 1988-1992), <emph render="italic">Art Around the Park</emph> (1990-1998), <emph render="italic">From Kepler 2 Cyberspace: Virtual Worlds / Digital Dreams</emph> (1993), and <emph render="italic">Windows of Chance / Change</emph> (circa 1998). Her television work includes <emph render="italic">ID / It's Dance</emph> (1987-1989) and the Nickelodeon series <emph render="italic">Eureeka's Castle</emph> (1989-1990).</p><p>In September 1980, Schloss began to produce A's Gallery (also called Salon A and Le Salon A), which presented visual works and installations every Saturday. Many shows were put together by guest curators and each exhibit presented a different theme.  In the 1990s, A's ended its regular schedule and Schloss developed A's Wave, a web platform to host multimedia performances and interactive projects. Schloss described A's Wave as the "digital sibling" of A's, where she practiced "investigating decontextualization extracting the digital usages of language with society's use of the Alphabet" (<emph render="italic">Bowery Artist Tribute</emph>, The New Museum).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At the time of accessioning, a collection-level record was created. No physical arrangement took place. The 2016 accretion was added in March 2016 (accession number 2016.008); these items were placed in acid free boxes and folders. Material was added in 2019 and placed in a rolled storage box. In 2023, an accretion was added to this collection. Loose material was grouped and foldered in the order it was found. A large amount of dust was removed from correspondence/announcement postcards found in a shoe box.</p><p>In 2024, this collection was processed by an archivist. The collection was divided into series based on the records' contents and arranged intellectually within these series. Audiovisual and digital physical media were arranged by format and lightly cleaned. Log sheets and notes stored within audio and video cases were removed and stored with other paper materials.</p><p>In the Spring of 2024, 5 linear feet of paper materials were stabilized and rehoused by the Conservation Department. 46 analog media items were treated for mold, and 48 were treated for pests. </p><p>37 optical discs, two flash drives, and two floppy disks were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged. New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content.</p>  </processinfo>

The recordings depict a variety of trips, including a European tour in the early 1980s with performances in London, Berlin, Munich, Dusseldorf, Amsterdam, and Brussels; a trip to Japan in 1987 to study language, characters, and sounds, which culminated in video exhibitions and "Peace on Earth," a light and sound environment piece; a trip to China in 1992 with Asian American artists, where she presented a media workshop at the Hong Kong Art Center and collaborated with the Peking Opera in Taiwan; a 1993 residency in Bremen, Germany, where she taught multimedia and fine arts at Hochschule für Kunste; a trip to South Korea in 1997 to participate in the Nine Dragon Heads International Environment Art Festival and Symposium; and repeated trips to Linz, Austria throughout the 1980s and 1990s to participate in the Ars Electronica Festival.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_29e1f8ff06bae853701f77ac903adce3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Leaving New York, first half time
