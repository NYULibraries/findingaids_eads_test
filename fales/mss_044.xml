His reputation as a major writer has been fueled in part by a disregard for the limitations of established literary genres and a unique approach to the historical, romance and detective novel. The Jerome Charyn Papers are comprised of his personal archive from the years: 1937-1997.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note:</head>
<p>Jerome Charyn was born in the Bronx, New York, in 1937. He entered the New York literary scene in 1963 upon publishing two of his short stories: 'Faigele,' 'the Idiotke' and 'On Second Avenue' in Commentary. His first novel, Once Upon A Droshky, which draws on his childhood experiences of the Jewish neighborhoods of the <geogname>Bronx</geogname>and earned for him a reputation as an emerging and major writer. In his more than twenty novels, Charyn has escaped the confines traditionally imposed on literary genres and has created a unique approach to historical, romance and detective novels. His works have been translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Greek and other languages, and Charyn currently resides in Paris.</p>  </bioghist>
