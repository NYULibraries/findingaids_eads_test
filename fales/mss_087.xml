    <abstract id="aspace_3a83a251f2c6f21898411b0ea49e0d40" label="Abstract">Francis Timothy Dlugos was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on August 5, 1950. From 1968-1971, he was a Christian Brother at La Salle College in Philadelphia. Upon leaving the Brothers, he emerged to embrace a politically active and gay lifestyle. In Washington, D.C. Dlugos worked on Ralph Nader's Public Citizen and become heavily involved with the Mass Transit poetry scene. Dlugos then moved to New York in the late seventies where he edited and contributed to such magazines as Christopher Street, New York Native, and The Poetry Project Newsletter. He immersed himself in the downtown scene of the late-nineteen-seventies through the eighties, and became involved with fundraising projects for that scene. Sometime after being diagnosed HIV positive, Tim decided to abandon these endeavors to become a priest in the Episcopalian church. While studying at the Yale School of Divinity, Dlugos died of AIDS related complications on December 3, 1990. The collection chronicles the life of Tim Dlugos from his early development as a poet through his posthumously published books and poems.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note:</head>
<p>Born in <geogname>Springfield, Massachusetts</geogname>on August 5, 1950, Francis Timothy Dlugos later grew up in <geogname>Arlington, Virginia</geogname>. He joined the Christian Brothers, a Catholic religious order, in 1968 and entered their college, <corpname>La Salle</corpname>, in <geogname>Philadelphia</geogname>. He left the Brothers a few years later in 1971 to openly embrace a politically active, gay lifestyle. He eventually left La Salle before graduating. In <geogname>Washington, D.C.</geogname>Dlugos worked on <name>Ralph Nader</name>'s Public Citizen and become heavily involved with the <name>Mass Transit poetry</name>scene. Describing his poetry in None of the Above, an early anthology in which Dlugos appeared, he stated: "1. I try to write out of the time &amp; space I find myself in. 2. My best work takes the 'timeless' -- spontaneous goofs, flights, body motions -- &amp; drags it onto timeline, the 'real world' where most of us live. I am 'successful' when the language (clean combination of words) takes me or someone else back to the original combination of feelings &amp; perceptions 'out there,' or somewhere equally nice. 3. My work is part of the nostalgia craze; all of it reminds me of where I used to be. 4. Grace, in a very orthodox sense, is my major preoccupation." Dlugos moved to New York in the late seventies where he edited and contributed to such magazines as <corpname>Christopher Street</corpname>, <corpname>New York Native</corpname>, and <corpname>The Poetry Project Newsletter</corpname>. He read everywhere and with almost everyone involved the downtown scene. Whether writing about pop culture, <geogname>New York</geogname>, being gay, alcoholism, or <name>AIDS</name>, content always came secondary to style in Dlugos' poetry. Sometime after being diagnosed <name>HIV</name>positive, Dlugos decided to abandon his career as a fundraiser to become a priest in the Episcopalian church where he could utilize and express his experiences as a gay man. While studying at the <corpname>Yale School of Divinity</corpname>, Dlugos died of AIDS related complications on December 3, 1990.</p><p>Bibliography: Works by Tim Dlugos:</p><p><list><item>Coming Attractions.
