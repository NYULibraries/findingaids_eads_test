Born-digital items were identified, physically separated, and inventoried but have not yet been forensically imaged, analyzed, or described. The February 2020 accretion to this collection has been intellectually added to this collections as Series II. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.</p><p>In the spring of 2020, materials in Boxes 13, 21, and 22 with water damage and evidence of mold were cleaned by a vendor, returned to the archives, and intellectually integrated into the collection.</p><p>In November 2023, video recordings donated in 2022 were intellectually incorporated into the existing arrangement in Box 24.</p>  </processinfo>
