    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Yoshio Kishi (1932- 2012) was an award-winning professional New York City based film and sound editor. Kishi was born in 1932 to Eikichi and Haru Kishi, both of whom immigrated from Japan to the United States. Kishi had four siblings: Hajime, Fumi, Mitsuo, and Isomi. He was educated at the Bronx High School of Sciences, the City College of New York, Herzliah Hebrew Teachers Institute, the Fashion Institute of Technology, and the New School for Social Research. Kishi briefly taught at New York's Film Institute and served as a juror for directing and editing at the Emmy Awards.</p>

<p> Kishi worked as an editor on Martin Scorcese's <emph render="italic">Raging Bull</emph> (1980), Alan Parker's <emph render="italic">Fame</emph> (1980), as well as Wayne Wang's <emph render="italic">Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart</emph> (1985). Kishi also worked as a sound editor on Jerry Schatzberg's <emph render="italic">Panic in Needle Park</emph> (1971) and, in addition to serving as the editor, Kishi also directed <emph render="italic">Lombardi</emph> (1968). </p>

<p>For four decades, Kishi avidly collected materials that traced depictions of Asian Americans in U.S. intellectual and popular culture, as well as materials produced by Asian American activists to counter stereotypical imagery of Asian peoples. His compulsion for collecting Asian Americana began in the mid-1960s when, reflecting upon his own identity as a second-generation Japanese American, Kishi began to regret not knowing more about his ethnic heritage. Kishi grew up in a largely Irish and Italian tenement neighborhood and during World War II, to avoid being labeled enemy aliens, his parents stopped speaking Japanese and joined a local Lutheran Church. In an effort to reclaim his ethnic heritage, Kishi, with the help of Los Angeles-based veteran actress and friend, Irene Yah Ling Sun, began to scour flea markets to purchase any materials relating to Asian Americana. Kishi eventually amassed over 10,000 items showcasing the demonization, as well as activism efforts of Asian Americans. Kishi's vast collection allowed him to trace Asian and Asian American depictions throughout two centuries of American history.</p>

<p>In his later life, Yoshio Kishi developed a relationship with New York University's Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) Institute and in 2003, he sold his collection of Asian Americana to New York University, on behalf of the A/P/A Institute. Kishi's collection, later titled the "Yoshio Kishi and Irene Yah-Ling Sun Collection" (MSS.292), was purchased with the intention of making its contents publicly available for research by students, scholars, and any other interested parties. Although Kishi parted with most of his Asian Americana collection, he did retain some materials for personal use, which laid the groundwork for the Yoshio Kishi Papers (MSS.351). </p>

<p>Yoshio Kishi died in 2012.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Yoshio Kishi Papers roughly span from 1892 to 2011, with the bulk of the materials dating between the 1950s to the mid-2000s. The collection documents various aspects of Kishi's professional and private life, as well as his contributions as a collector of Asian American materials. </p><p>The collection contains correspondence between Kishi and his family members, friends, colleagues, as well as other collectors of Asian American ephemera. There are several volumes of Kishi's journals that contain insights into his daily life, as well as drafts of project ideas, poems, and other creative writings. </p><p>As a second generation Japanese American, Kishi was especially concerned with stereotypical Asian American imagery in the United States, and to this effect, the collection contains vast quantities of research materials such as photocopies of articles and book chapters that examine racist portrayals of Asian peoples in film, photocopies of old Hollywood movie posters such as the Humphrey Bogart film <emph render="italic">Tokyo Joe</emph> (1949), as well as newspaper clippings related to famous Asian celebrities such as Anna May Wong and Michelle Wei. It should be noted the collection, particularly in Series II, does contain material that may be deemed offensive and/or racist. </p><p>The Yoshio Kishi Papers also includes documents relating to the Yoshio Kishi and Irene Yah-Ling Sun Collection (MSS.292), which was purchased from Yoshio Kishi in 2003 by New York University's Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) Institute. These documents include drafts of the legal agreements between Kishi and New York University, inventories of the Kishi/Sun Collection, brochures promoting the Kishi/Sun collection, and photographs from the "Archivist of the Yellow Peril" exhibition host by the A/P/A Institute in 2005. The "Archivist of the Yellow Peril" exhibition provided glimpses of the Kishi/Sun Collection's 8000+ rare artifacts. </p><p>The Yoshio Kishi Papers contains photographs and photo negatives whose subject matters range from general everyday life, Kishi's family, and Asian American stereotypes. The collection also contains one audioreel entitled "Mama" and two video interviews with Yoshio Kishi that have been recorded on VHS tapes. </p>  </scopecontent>

The series contains correspondence between Kishi and various productions companies such as Pathe Films and NFL Films, discssuing past and future collaborations, as well as copies of Kishi's resumes and video editing certificate, highlighting his career achievements. Materials related to Kishi's major film projects, <emph render="italic">Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart</emph> and <emph render="italic">Lombardi</emph> can be found within this series. Additionally, drafts, outlines, and proposals for Kishi's other film projects such as <emph render="italic">Vietnam Song</emph>, <emph render="italic"> Empress of China</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Soulmate (The Black Hole)</emph> can also be found within this series. </p><p>Series I also contains samples of Kishi's poetry and short stories, which are housed within his diaries and notes. This series also contains materials related to Kishi's growing advocacy of Asian American culture, a driving force behind Kishi's passion for collection Asian Americana. Kishi's participation in pro-Asian and pro-Asian American organizations are reflected in folders such as "Asian Americans for Action" (Box 1, Folder 3), the "Ethnic Heritage Studies Program Act" (Box 1, Folder 18) and "Yellow Peril" (Box 3, Folder 15).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_4b9db22ae26aef4297f38b82d8e88685" level="file"><did><unittitle>Amerasia Resources, Inc. </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1971/1971">1971</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

A large focus of Series III is Kishi's desire to learn more about his own family history. This can be seen through his vast collection of family photographs, detailed family trees, individual files about family members, and discussions with his family regarding their Japanese origins. Kishi's mother, Haru, features heavily within this series through letters, photographs, legals documents (social security card, passports), and medical documents. </p><p>In addition to his family, this series contains insights into Yoshio Kishi's private life through several journals, financial statements, school transcripts, travel documents, newspaper articles, photographs, and legal paperwork. </p><p>The correspondence housed within this series is mainly between Kishi and his family, although there are some letters from friends and Kishi's personal physician. The photographs and photograph negatives found within this series depict Kishi's family, apartment, personal acquaintances, as well as moments from everyday life.  </p><p>Series III also contains an audioreel entitled "Mama" and a VHS tape interview with Yoshio Kishi. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_2de0b44d97af15fb7788700b960f7674" level="file"><did><unittitle>Asahi Video Library -
