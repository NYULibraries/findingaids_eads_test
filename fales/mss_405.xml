    <abstract id="aspace_a90d1e485faed592aa9c7da34f8cc9dd">Larry Polansky (b. 1954) is an American music composer, performer, teacher, writer, and computer programmer. The Larry Polansky Papers document an individual's ongoing career in the creation, performance, and education of music, beginning in the 1970s to the mid-2010s. The bulk of these papers consist of Polansky's extensive output as a composer through work files, performance notes, and sound recordings. Event ephemera and audiovisual recordings document musical performances and festival/conference appearances from the 1980s through the mid-2010s. This collection contains office files for Frog Peak Music, an artists' collective co-founded by Polansky and Jody Diamond, as well as administrative files for Lingua Press, a company absorbed by Frog Peak Music in 1995. Polansky's departmental files from Mills College and Dartmouth College dating from the 1980s through 2013 can also be found in this collection. Writing and project files in both paper and electronic format document Polansky's extensive and varied interests within the modern music field, covering subjects such as music composition, psychoacoustics and formal perception, new tuning systems, instrumentation, and computer programs for algorithmic composition. Of note are his work files on his profiles and analysis of various composers and their works including Johanna Magdalena Beyer, Ruth Crawford Seeger, and James Tenney. Polansky's personal files contain correspondence and subject files related to his work, illustrating his extensive network of colleagues and friends within his field. Large groupings of regularly backed up computer files containing a combination of personal and professional documents from the 1980s to the 2010s are in this collection.</abstract>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Boxes were transferred from the donor to the Fales Library and Special Collections in 2014, along with a box-level container list written by a donor associate. Documentation supporting the container list indicated the boxes were not in any particular order. Upon arrival at the library, staff transferred box contents to standard size record cartons and oversize boxes for appropriate onsite storage. This reboxing altered the original box numbering and content descriptions as some boxes were combined, or separated. A new spreadsheet was created with updated box numbers, while notating in a separate field the original box content descriptions and old box numbers from the donor's inventory.</p><p>Before processing, an initial survey was completed, confirming the material did not have any logical original order, with the exception of small groups of alphabetical correspondence/subject folders removed from file cabinets as well as Frog Peak/Linqua Press office files. The majority of the material had been placed loose in cartons, sometimes grouped by format (e.g. audio reels, cassette tapes, selected sheet music). </p><p>Material in this collection naturally fell into rough groupings such as compositions/arrangements, teaching files, writings, performance ephemera, Frog Peak/Lingua Press files, and personal material. </p><p>When possible, original file folders were retained. If it was necessary to replace the folder, the original file titles were transcribed onto the new acid-free folders in brackets. Loose material was grouped and placed in acid-free folders and boxes, with archivist-designated titles.</p><p>Audiovisual material was grouped by format and listed at the box level within appropriate series.</p><p>144 carriers of born-digital material were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. </p><p>Larry Polansky's website was archived to the Internet Archive using the Archive-It service beginning in 2015 and site crawls are as of 2019 being accrued semiannually.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection documents Larry Polansky's ongoing work in the contemporary music field from the 1970s to the mid-2010s through music compositions, recordings, teaching notes, business and project files, as well as concert ephemera in paper and electronic formats. Business files in this collection were generated by Polansky's artists' collective, Frog Peak Music, and contain promotional catalogs, publicity material, as well as client files which provide insight into the operation of a collective devoted to publishing and producing experimental and unique works by composers active during the 1980s into the 2000s. Office files for Lingua Press contain administrative material, as well as documentation of the company's 1995 acquisition by Frog Peak Music. Polansky's extensive writings on modern music theory, composers, and compositions are represented in this collection through paper and electronic versions of notes and edited drafts of articles, papers, and reviews written throughout the 1970s to the 2000s. Paper and electronic files, as well as audio recordings document Polansky's various projects, including his music recording career, development of his computer program Hierarchical Music Specification Language (HMSL), and his project with Indonesian composers and performers from the 1980s with Jody Diamond. Lectures notes and slides, correspondence, and faculty-related material in this collection relate to Polansky's music composition and theory classes he taught at Mills College Center for Contemporary Music from the 1980s to 1990s, and Dartmouth College from 1990 to 2013. This collection also contains his archived website; his backed up personal and professional electronic files; news clippings; correspondence and subject files; and his private audiocassette collection can also be found in this collection.</p>  </scopecontent>

These events include solo and group concerts, performances of his works by others, as well as his appearances and participation in music-related conferences and festivals from the 1980s to the 2000s.
This series also contains files Polansky had grouped himself by event, performance group, or subject, including topics such as dance, Gamelan music, an Australia concert tour, and Ostrava concerts. Files Polansky accumulated on groups he performed with include the New Kanon New Music Ensemble, the Berkeley Mandolin Ensemble, and DownTown Ensemble. Polansky also collected programs, announcements, calendars, and posters for Mills College and Dartmouth College performances dating from the 1980s to the 2000s, in which he was involved as a performer or organizer.
Work files for select concerts, conferences, and festivals are described in Series V.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_c8b199d6ce66454ca40bc61bf533e4a2"><head>Processing Information</head><p>Loose concert and event material was grouped by decade and foldered by the processing archivist. Individual files on specific groups, institutions, and events created by Polansky remain in their original folders and headings when possible.

As a reviewer, editor, and writer, Polansky wrote frequently on topics related to modern music and composers. Writing files in this series typically contain correspondence, edited drafts, and published articles with a significant amount regarding the works and theories of composer James Tenney. This series contains a significant amount of project files for the Ruth Crawford Seeger-related book <emph render="italic">The Music of American Folk Song... </emph> (2001) which include research, edited drafts, correspondence, song transcriptions, and digitized Seeger family photographs. Planning files for Seeger-related concerts and events are also in this series. Polansky's work files on a Harry Partch music transcription project includes annotated sheet music, research, and notes dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
Documentation in this series on the development of Hierarchical Music Specification Language (HMSL), a computer program Polansky co-wrote with Phil Burk and David Rosenboom while teaching at Mills College, includes grant requests, user manual drafts, presentation notes/slides, old source code, code logs, articles, and notes from the 1980s to the 2000s. Additional material on the Frog Peak Music publication of the HMSL user manual and promotion is in Series III.A. Sound recordings and computer files related to Eine Kleine Gamelan Music, a group project using HMSL, is also in this series.
During 1988 and 1989, Polansky and Jody Diamond worked on a Gamelan music project in Indonesia with native composers and musicians. This project is documented through notebooks, studio recording logs, and audio recordings of recording sessions. Polansky and Diamond eventually produced albums from this project, including <emph render="italic">Asmat Dream</emph>, <emph render="italic">Mana 689</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Karya.</emph>
 
 
Polansky's career as a recording artist is documented in this series through paper and computer files; audio recordings of studio sessions and practices; recording session notes and logs; cd images and promotional material; and contracts. Of note are his recording sessions from the late 1990s to early 2000s for his <emph render="italic">51 Melodies</emph> album and improvisation sessions with his group,Trio, which includes fellow musicians Christian Wolff and Kui Dong.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_5f56b6ffec388425625912b07f5a0e39" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">1 / 1 The Quarterly Journal of the Just Intonation Network</emph>...Guest Editor</unittitle><unitid>cuid25525</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1985/1985" type="inclusive">1985</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Polansky's correspondence and subject files comprise a large portion of the paper files in this series, containing correspondence with colleagues and friends within the modern music field, including Christian Wolff, James Tenney, Kenneth Gaburo, and Anita Feldman. These files also contain Polansky's subject and research files on specific composers, theories, and funding ideas. This series contains a significant number of clippings from the 1970s to the 2000s on Polansky and his work, including profiles, reviews of albums and performances, and his work with Frog Peak Music.
This series also contains Polansky's regularly backed up computer files which remain grouped by the date of the backup. Files found within these backups range in date from the 1980s to the 2000s, including a mixture of both personal and professional files. Personal computer files include correspondence and calendar entries, while professional-related materials include album recording information, teaching-related material, and other projects. His archived website includes a complete list of his scores, audio recordings, and document files including writings and special projects. 
Polansky's personal audiocassette collection contains commercial and homemade recordings of work by friends and colleagues, many of which are not widely distributed. These recordings range in date from the 1970s to 2000s. Polansky's audition and college senior concert audio recordings from the late 1970s can also be found in this series.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_86e2aa78a423071dff9058cab9e9371b"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Files remain in their original alphabetical arrangement, most retaining their original file titles. </p><p>The inventory lists either in an alphabetical range by title or listed individually if the title has more than one folder.</p><p>
