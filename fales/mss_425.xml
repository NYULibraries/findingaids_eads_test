This collection has significant documentation on her theatrical rock band, The Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black (TVHKB), co-founded in 1988 with her first husband Samoa Moriki. The majority of the collection consists of photographs of the band on and off stage and publicity photo shoots, many taken by New York-based photographers. Band press clippings, handwritten lyrics, costume drawings, setlists, publicity material, and posters are also in this collection. Pfahler's performance art pieces and filmmaking with members of the Cinema of Transgression film group are documented through photographs, still footage, and promotional material. Photographs from her modeling career, fashion line, and art exhibitions are also in this collection. Materials from Pfahler's personal life include correspondence, press clippings, as well as a significant amount of photographs. Subjects of these materials include her family, first husband Samoa Moriki, partner Colin de Land, travel, and pets, as well as portraits of Pfahler from early childhood to adulthood.</abstract>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Kembra Pfahler Papers (dated 1961-2015) document Pfahler's work as a filmmaker, artist, actress, model, and rock musician. This collection contains a significant number of photographs chronicling the path of Pfahler and Samoa Moriki's New York City-based theatrical rock band The Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black (TVHKB) both on and off the stage while they performed in New York City clubs including CBGB and the Marquee, and on tour throughout the United States during the late 1980s to the early 2000s. Many of the photographs were taken by New York-based photographers including Laure Leber, Katrina del Mar, Steve Glemboski, and Tina Paul. Pfahler's handwritten music lyrics, setlists, scrapbooks, costume sketches, press clippings, and promotional fliers and posters provide insight into a Lower East Side band that incorporated performance art and music into their stage shows. Images of their glam rock and dark humor performances in this collection include graphic nudity and simulated sexual acts. Their costuming typically included members with painted naked bodies, wigs, false rotted teeth, and handmade costumes and props created by Pfahler and other members. 
<lb/> 
<lb/>
Outside of the band, Pfahler pursued adjacent careers including her participation in the 1980s underground film movement Cinema of Transgression, which used shock value and black humor in film. This collection contains documentation of some of her films including photographs, film stills, promotional material, and a set of stills with New York artists and fellow Cinema of Transgression members Nick Zedd and Annie Sprinkle as actors. Her acting work is represented in this collection through video sleeve covers and promotional material from 1990s fetish films which include imagery of BDSM and other simulated sex acts. Pfahler's work as a print and runway model is depicted in both photographs and publications in this collection, including photographs taken by Rosalie Knox, Annie Sprinkle, Laure Leber, and Richard Kern, some of which include nudity and sexual situations. Her work as a performance and visual artist dates from the 1980s to 2010s and is represented in this collection through photograph documentation of performances, exhibition spaces, installations of her drawings and self-portraits, and notes, as well as promotional material for openings and events. These performances and artworks often depict Pfahler in her Karen Black character, with her naked body painted, wearing a black wig and false rotten teeth, and sometimes include other members from TVHKB. This collection also contains drawings, notes, press clippings, and runway show photographs related to Pfahler's clothing line from the early 2000s. Materials from Pfahler's personal life include correspondence, ephemera, and press clippings, as well as a significant amount of photographs of Pfahler's friends, family, travels, portraits of Pfahler, first husband Samoa Moriki, and partner Colin de Land.</p>  </scopecontent>

This series contains material dating from the late 1980s to the 2000s when the band was most active and performing in New York City clubs including the Kitchen, Ritz, CBGB, Pyramid, Marquee, and Boy Bar, as well as summer tours in 1994 and 1995. The majority of this series chronicles their performances through photographs by multiple New York-based photographers including Laure Leber, Katrina del Mar, Steve Glemboski, and Tina Paul. These glam rock-style, darkly humorous performances often include large props, graphic nudity, and simulated sexual acts. Many performances included a segment where Pfahler, dressed as her Karen Black character, wearing a wig and false rotted teeth in full body paint performing a handstand while band members dressed as bunnies cracked eggs filled with coloring onto Pfahler's vaginal area. Photographs in this series also document the band's pre-show preparations including painting their naked bodies, attaching wigs and false teeth, and doning costumes, as well as post-show images of the band meeting fans, socializing with each other, and the removal of their body paint in small utility sinks and showers backstage during their tours. Images of photo shoot with the band were produced for use on posters, announcements, and album covers. Most of these photographs were taken by New York photographers including Richard Kern, Annie Sprinkle, Michael Halsband, and Michael Levine.

Pfahler's participation in the 1980s underground film movement Cinema of Transgression, is well documented in this series through handmade fliers, posters, correspondence, and photgraphic stills for <emph render="italic">Murder Mysteries</emph>, <emph render="italic">Historic Beauty Treatments</emph>, <emph render="italic">Cornella: The Story of a Burning Bush</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Mild Seven: The Cowboy Stories</emph>. Film stills for <emph render="italic">Trilogy of Teri</emph> include fellow-artists Nick Zedd and Annie Sprinkle as actors. The series also contains material documenting her film acting through video sleeve covers and promotional material for 1990s fetish films, which depict imagery of BDSM and other simulated sex acts. Film stills and on-set photographs for her acting jobs in <emph render="italic">Boys on the Side</emph> and <emph render="italic">Ferrum 5000</emph> are also in this series.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Her performance art career is well-represented in this series, including photographic documentation and promotional material dating from 1984 to 1987 for Pfahler's early performance art group, Oroboro, which often included her husband/fellow band member, Samoa. Later performance art pieces dating from the 1990s and 2000s include Pfahler as her Karen Black character, with her naked body painted, wearing a black wig and false rotting teeth. She is photographed in various locations, sometimes also with members of the Karen Black band in costume as well. Some performance art pieces were later produced as videos/films, including her 1996 Punk Ladies of Wrestling (PLOW) event and film. Material for PLOW includes photographs, a press release, and promotional material for the film.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Pfahler's work as a visual artist shown through drawings and photographic self-portraits date from the early 2000s to 2010. Many of the works were exhibited at New York galleries. Her openings often included a performance art piece and/or band performances. Images of installations, opening parties, and performances are in this series, as well as exhibition artwork lists, notes, posters, and announcements. These performances and artworks often include Pfahler in her Karen Black character. Examples include the 2003 exhibition <emph render="italic">Kembra Pfahler: Availabism and Anti-Naturalism: A Feminine Experiment</emph> (which included a live performance of <emph render="italic">A Star is Born: The Horror Version</emph>), <emph render="italic">Womanizer</emph> in 2008, and <emph render="italic">Giverny</emph> with artist E.V. Day in 2012.

Pfahler's work as a print and runway model is depicted in both photographs, publications, and press clippings in this series, including images depicting nudity, fetishism, BDSM, and other sexual situations. Modeling photographers include Rosalie Knox, Laure Leber, Rick Owens, and Richard Kern. This series also contains drawings, notes, press clippings, ephemera, and runway show photographs related to Pfahler's clothing line from the early 2000s. This series contains a small amount of personal correspondence and press clippings, as well as a significant amount of photographs of friends; family; first husband Samoa Morika; partner Colin de Land; childhood, teen, and adult portraits of Pfahler; and trips to Japan, Cape Cod, and Hawaii.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_b2eda5c21c8ffc2f2382e1076a855ac5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Early Ephemera -- Souvenir Hospital Certificate</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/990390</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1961/1961">1961</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
