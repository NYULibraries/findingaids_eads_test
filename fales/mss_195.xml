The bulk of the collection dates from between 1980 and 1988. The organization sought to encourage artistic collaboration by producing plays written by poets using sets and costumes designed by visual artists, and its archive is composed largely of correspondence, clippings from newspapers and periodicals, and the company's general administrative and financial records. A slightly smaller quantity of the archive reflects the company's theater productions, including scripts, promotional materials, video recordings, and photographs of the performances, art, and individuals involved.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Eye and Ear Theater Company was founded in 1979 by Ada Katz, wife of the painter Alex Katz; Roy Leaf, vice president of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture; and theater director Mac McGinnes, as a non-profit theatrical production company. Inspired by the poet and artist theaters of the 1950s and early 1960s, such as John B. Myers' Artists' Theatre and the Judson Poets Theatre of Greenwich Village, the organization sought to encourage artistic collaboration through Off Broadway productions of plays written by poets with sets and costumes designed by painters and scultptors. It was run by a Board of Directors which was composed of the company's founders along with Bob Holman, Susan Davis, Beth DeWoody, George Schneeman, and later Joanne Cassulon, Mark Charles, James Kraft, Rosie Levai, Michael O'Brian, and Paul Chupf. The Board dealt with fundraising, production, administration, and publicity. It also set the company's artistic goals, and in pursuing them relied on the assistance of an Advisory Board, which included noted poets, choreographers, and artists like John Ashbery, Edwin Denby, Laura Dean, Paul Taylor, Red Grooms, and Jennifer Bartlett. The members of both bodies were volunteers who contributed resources like office space and secretarial services in addition to their time. Their work would be supported by a paid administrative staff beginning in 1985. The poets and artists were paid for their work and the sets and costumes used in the company's productions remained the property of the theatre company, which on occasion lent them to art exhibitions. Much of the organization's funding came from individuals, corporations, and foundations, as well as state and federal grants, including The National Endowment for the Arts, Lila Acheson Wallace Fund, The Samuel and May Rudin Foundation, The Kulcher Foundation, The Leonhardt Foundation, and The Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts.</p><p>The Eye and Ear Theater Company strove to produce three plays per season, each developed through collaborations between poets, visual artists, and theater directors, usually with the assistance of other specialists. Among the company's productions are works from both contemporary and past poets. The organization's first production, <emph render="italic">City Junket</emph> written by Kenward Elmslie and designed by Red Grooms, opened in 1980 accompanied by a smaller staging of <emph render="italic">Litany</emph> by John Ashbery with sets by Alex Katz. The next season saw the production of Edwin Denby's <emph render="italic">Four Plays by Edwin Denby</emph>, a play originally written for one of Andy Warhol's uncompleted film projects, with sets designed by Elizabeth Murray and costumes by Judith Shea under the direction of Bob Holman. Also produced were <emph render="italic">The Heroes</emph> by John Ashbery with sets by Jane Freilicher and <emph render="italic">Shopping and Waiting</emph> by James Schuyler on a set designed by Alex Katz. In 1982 the company staged Ed Friedman's <emph render="italic">The White Snake</emph> using sets and costumes designed by Robert Kushner followed in 1983 by <emph render="italic">Paid on Both Sides</emph> by W.H. Auden designed by David Hockney. In 1984 Eye and Ear produced the single act drama <emph render="italic">Desire Caught by the Tail</emph> by Pablo Picasso with sets developed by Linda Benglis. The next year the company produced a play it had commissioned from the poet Alice Notley entitled <emph render="italic">Anne's White Glove</emph> on a set designed by Jane Dickson. In 1988 the company produced <emph render="italic">Kaddish</emph> written by Allen Ginsberg and designed by Eric Fischl.</p><p><emph render="bold">Sources</emph></p><p>"Eye and Ear Theatre Artistic Statement," Undated, Eye and Ear

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Eye and Ear Theatre Archive contains records documenting the operations of the Eye and Ear Theatre Company between the years 1979 and 1996, as well as copies of news articles and promotional materials dating from as early as 1965, with most of the items dated 1980 through 1988. A substantial portion of the collection is comprised of business correspondence written and received by the company's staff, particularly Ada Katz and Susan Davis. Among the activities reflected by the letters are outreach efforts, such as attempts to recruit artists, poets, and directors for productions as well as members for the Board of Directors and the Advisory Board. The correspondence also describes the company's fundraising efforts, such as benefits and solicitations for donations from corporations and individuals, and individual productions. Further documentation of the Eye and Ear Theater Company's activities appears in administrative records, such as minutes from meetings of its Board of Directors, and financial records including budgets and applications for grants from and reports made to the National Endowment for the Arts. Also present are a few of the company's tax forms and year end statements. Another significant component of the collection is clippings taken from newspapers and periodicals regarding the company, some of the poets and artists it recruited, and reviews of Eye and Ear productions. Of particular note in this category of record are those located in Series III. These include articles discussing the idea of artistic collaboration in general and accounts of avant garde theatre productions staged by other companies presenting works by artists and authors like Kenneth Koch, Sergei Diaghilev, and Isamu Noguchi. Occasionally these clippings bear annotations or are accompanied by handwritten notes.</p><p>With regard to the productions staged by the Eye and Ear Theater Company the collection also holds scripts, programs, and advertisements along with a smaller quantity of contracts, receipts, actor or artist biographies, and notes including set design sketches, rehearsal and performance schedules. The productions are also documented in photographs depicting performances, sets, costumes, actors, artists, poets, and directors. In addition the collection holds three videotapes, one of which is a documentary of the company's 1988 production of Allan Ginsberg's <emph render="italic">Kaddish</emph>.</p>  </scopecontent>
