    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Mary Beth Edelson (1933-2021) was an American artist whose work included printmaking, book art, sculpture, collage art, painting, photography, performance art, and writing. Edelson studied at the Art Institute of Chicago as a teenager and then earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from DePauw University in 1955. She later earned her Master of Fine Arts from New York University in 1958.</p><p>Edelson was a prominent artist within the feminist art movement in the United States, which began in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Her feminist and conceptual art often challenged patriarchal systems and included themes such as ancient goddess figures, nude female bodies, notable historical scenes, and popular culture. In 1968, Edelson established the Conference for Women in the Visual Arts (CWVA) and in the late 1970s, she joined the feminist art cooperative, A.I.R. Gallery (Artists in Residence), and the feminist political arts group, Heresies Collective.</p><p>Edelson's works have been exhibited domestically and internationally at institutions including the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City and the Malmo Museum in Sweden. Some of her notable works include <emph render="italic">Some Living American Women Artists</emph> (1972), <emph render="italic">Memorial to 9,000,000 Women Burned as Witches in the Christian Era</emph> (1977), <emph render="italic">Kali Bobbitt</emph> (1994), and <emph render="italic">Story Gathering Boxes</emph> (1972-2021).</p><p>Edelson was also an arts educator and taught at a variety of locations including Chicago, Michigan, Minneapolis, and Pennsylvania. She also taught a nine-week women's study course in art at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. </p><p>In addition to her life as a working artist, Edelson was an advocate for women's rights and a vocal opponent of domestic violence. From 1992-1994, Edelson served as the leader of the Women's Action Coalition's Committee on Diveristy and Inclusion. She also worked closely with Combat Zone: Campaign HQ Against Domestic Violence. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Mary Beth Edelson Papers (1950-2016) consist of materials created and collected by Edelson and document her life as a working artist, feminist, and activist. The collection contains correspondence, grant applications, exhibition ephemera, art books, publications, photographs, slides of works and exhibitions, clippings of reviews and press releases, visual source materials, as well as subject files. Together, these materials highlight the types of exhibitions Edelson participated in, her various inspirations for art pieces, and the ways in which she was perceived by her colleagues and critics. Edelson's notebooks and sketchbooks document her artistic processes, providing further context about her life as an artist. These materials also reflect Edelson's affiliation and participation with A.I.R. Gallery (Artists in Residence). An overarching theme within Edelson's art is the power of the Goddess and the nude female body. This imagery appears frequently in the artwork found in both Series I: Professional Activities and Series III: A.I.R. Gallery.</p><p>Edelson participated in numerous women's rights and anti-domestic violence protests, fundraisers, and charity events. Edelson's activism with the Women's Action Coalition (WAC) and Combat Zone: Campaign HQ Against Domestic Violence are documented through posters for events and organizations, photographs, flyers, slides, feminist essays, correspondence, press releases, and artwork. </p><p>In addition to Edelson's life as an artist and activist, the collection contains materials related to Edelson's personal life and interests through correspondence with her family, alumni bulletins published by her alma mater DePauw University, her college-era sketchbooks, anti-war ephemera, and personal travel materials.</p><p>The collection also contains digital photographs of an Edelson collage featured as part of a Louise Bourgeois exhibition at the Tate Modern, as well as digital photographs and documents related to the creation of an A.I.R. Gallery book. </p>  </scopecontent>

In the 1990s, Edelson focused on Hollywood's portrayal of women and the femme fatale in film. To this effect, this sub-series contains her handwritten notes about various film noirs, as well as photographs of actresses including Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Gloria Grahame, Sharon Stone, and Gena Rowlands. Sub-Series I.C also includes a range of visual source materials including images of flowers, goddesses, guns, people, and patterns – all of which served as sources of inspiration for Edelson's collage art.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_1d8b91b0b349533383a015e4511a8c7c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Books (List of Research Materials)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1980/2002" type="inclusive">1980, 1998, 2002</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

In 1977, Edelson began an art collaboration with Suzanne Lacy (Los Angeles), Nil Yalter (Turkey), Ulrike Rosenbach (Germany), and Miriam Sharon (Israel), and in 2003, she self-published a book titled <emph render="italic">International Feminist Collaboration, 1977-1979</emph> that contained copies of letters exchanged between the women and art project collaboration ideas. Drafts, Edelson's notes, and mock ups of the book can be found within this sub-series.</p><p>In addition to Edelson's international feminist art collaboration, Sub-Series I.D contains papers related to the Heresies Collective, a feminist political arts group Edelson joined in the late 1970s. These materials include notes about the group and a few copies of their publication, <emph render="italic">Chrysalis</emph>. This sub-series also contains photographs, conference materials, and essays related to the Conference for Women in Visual Arts (CWVA), of which Edelson was a founder.</p><p>Edelson was an advocate for female artists and the works they produced, and in the late 1980s and early 1990s, she was a member of the Title Nine Task Force. The group's mission was to increase the presence of women's art in museums, in accordance with the Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned sex discrimination in federally funded organizations including the Guggenheim or Museum of Modern Art. Materials related to the Title Nine Task Force consist of posters and reports.</p><p>This sub-series also contains posters advertising Edelson's speaking engagements, as well as some photographs of workshops and lectures. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_5ffd84e6498b235453b5c9008bc84620" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chicago -

WAC was a feminist open-alliance organization founded in New York City in 1992. The organization's mission was to address women's rights issues through direct action. Combat Zone, an affiliate of WAC, was a multifaceted project designed to fight domestic violence. The project provided self defense classes, counseling, workshops about domestic violence, and more. The Combat Zone headquarters also served as an art space and featured some of Mary Beth Edelson's work, including <emph render="italic">Kali Bobbitt</emph>. Materials in this series consist of posters for events and organizations, photographs, flyers, slides, feminist essays, correspondence, press releases, and artwork.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_43799817c978cb318ab4c7aded850b86"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Materials have been arranged alphabetically by file title.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_16792a21414519d76535c5c6c371f8e8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Combat Zone: Campaign HQ Against Domestic Violence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1994/1994">1994</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
