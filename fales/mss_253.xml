<p>Paul Langland is a choreographer, dancer and educator. Langland received his BFA in Sculpture and Performance from the California College of Arts and Crafts in 1973. While in California, Langland began his involvement with the Contact Improvisation dance technique, studying under its founder Steve Paxton. </p><p>After moving to New York City in the 1970s, Langland began working with choreographer and performer Meredith Monk, whose company he later joined. Langland remained a member of the Meredith Monk Vocal Ensemble until 1985. </p><p>During his time in New York City, Langland also studied closely under dancer Allan Wayne. After Wayne's death in 1978, Langland began teaching his technique, under the name "Allan Wayne Work," and continued to develop his work. </p><p>Throughout his career, Langland has performed at various notable performance spaces and with various performance groups including The House, Danspace, Dance Theater Workshop, LaMama, The Kitchen, and Franklin Furnace, among others. Langland has also held a number of fellowships and residencies, leading to performances and workshops throughout North America, Europe, Korea, Venezuela and Cuba.
