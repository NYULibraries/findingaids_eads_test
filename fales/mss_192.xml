    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Stuart A. Sherman was a performance artist, playwright, filmmaker, videographer, poet, essayist, sculptor and collagist. He was born 9 November 1945 to Helen Gordon and Samuel Sherman in Providence, Rhode Island. Soon after attending Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, Sherman moved to Manhattan and began a career in the arts which would span the next three decades. Before mounting his own work, Stuart Sherman worked extensively with Charles Ludlam in the early days of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company and with Richard Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric Theatre (Sherman appeared as Max in Foreman's "Pain(t)" in 1974). </p><p> Sherman was possibly best known for his solo "spectacles": programs of very short playlets performed on tabletops, in which he would physically manipulate and create semantic "dramas" around inanimate objects. He created and performed eighteen "spectacles" in all (12 solo and 6 group performances) as well as larger-scale dramatic works, including "Chekhov, Brecht and Strindberg" (1985-86), a trilogy of short plays adapting and commenting obliquely on those authors, "Slant (concerning Emily Dickinson)" (1987), and "Solaris" (1992). </p><p>Stuart Sherman also made over forty films and videos (rarely lasting more than five minutes), many of the most haunting of which were portraits of friends: <emph render="italic">Portrait of Benedicte Pesle</emph> (1984), <emph render="italic">Mr. Ashley Proposes (Portrait of George)</emph> (1985), <emph render="italic">Liberation (Portrait of Berenice Reynaud)</emph> (1993), and the 73-second <emph render="italic">Edwin Denby</emph> (1978). Nearly all of Stuart Sherman's film works are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. 
 
Although best known for his performances and video, Sherman practiced in a variety of visual and literary mediums. He considered all of his artistic practices to share a performative dimension, and denied any guiding aesthetic principle. Sherman was wary of attributing any strict meaning to his work and assumed an essential polysemy in its interpretation. This assumption critically aligned Sherman's work with that of many of his downtown contemporaries. </p><p>Akin to the many distinct forms his art took, Sherman's work found an international audience. Although perhaps most at home with his New York contemporaries, he performed, exhibited, and lectured throughout the US (San Francisco, Cambridge, Boston, Indianapolis, Chicago) and abroad (Germany, Holland, The Netherlands, France, Wales, Japan, Australia). </p><p>Stuart Sherman received numerous awards for his work, including a Prix de Rome, a Guggenheim Fellowship, an Obie, a MacDowell Colony fellowship, an Asian Cultural Council Grant, a DAAD Grant for residency in Berlin and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. </p><p> Sherman died of AIDS in San Francisco on 14 September 2001. </p><p><emph render="bold">Stage Works:</emph> </p><p> - First Spectacle (1975) </p><p> - Second Spectacle (with Stefan Brecht, Richard Foreman, Kate Manheim) (1976) </p><p> - Seventh Spectacle (with 30 performers) (1976) </p><p> - Tenth Spectacle (Portraits of Places) (1978) </p><p> - Eleventh Spectacle (The Erotic) (1979) </p><p> - Twelfth Spectacle (Language) (1980) </p><p> - Thirteenth Spectacle (Time) (1980) </p><p> - First Trilogy: Hamlet, Oedipus, Faust (1981-84) </p><p> - Second Trilogy: Chekhov, Strindberg, Brecht (1985-86) </p><p> - The Man in Room 2538 (1986) </p><p> - It Is Against the Law To Shout "Fire" In A Crowded Theater (1986) </p><p> - Endless Meadow and So Forth (1986) </p><p> - This House Is Mine Because I Live In It (1986) </p><p> - Slant (concerning Emily Dickinson) (1987) </p><p> - Crime and Punishment, or the Book and the Word (1987) </p><p> - "A" Is For Actor (1987) </p><p> - The Yellow Chair (1987) </p><p> - But What Is The Word For "Bicycle"?

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Stuart Sherman Papers include material pertaining to his career as a performance and visual artist, writer, actor, and filmmaker. The collection is largely composed of material related to Sherman's artistic output including performance plans, prose and poetry, sketches and diagrams for visual and performance works, drafts for sculpture, photographs, slides, video, film, audio, and floppy disks. Personal material such as correspondence, journal writing, legal and financial documents along with works by fellow artists and writers also make up a large portion of the collection. The material spans from 1945-2001 with the bulk of it covering from 1961-2001. The original order and description of material has largely been preserved and in most cases has been arranged chronologically. Thirteen series and one oversize series divide the collection into subgroups for the convenience of the researcher.</p><p>
The Stuart Sherman Papers are divided into thirteen series:</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES I: Personal</emph> consists of personal items and documents including correspondence, resumes, and various material for psychological/spiritual healing. </p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES II: Legal and Financial</emph> includes legal and financial documentation such as apartment leases, tax returns, bank account information, and Sherman's will. </p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES III: Prose, Poetry and Other Writing</emph> contains much of Sherman's creative writing from his teenage years up until his death. The material has been ordered chronologically in groups respective of the arrangement as received: Juvenilia; Notes and Poetry; Reviews and Prose; Poetry; and Diagram Poetry. Although attempts were made to isolate these groups within this series, researchers may find Sherman's poetry and prose mixed throughout the collection. For example, poetry may be found in address books, in notebooks titled prose writing, alongside performance planning, or in other places. </p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES IV: Performance</emph> consists of material related to Sherman's performances including written plans, diagrams, programs, correspondence, promotional material, and press. </p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES V: Works by Others</emph> includes works by artists and writers other than Stuart Sherman which were included in his personal archive. Artworks, books, academic/professional journals, exhibition catalogs, and other miscellaneous items may be found in this series.</p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES VI: Artworks</emph> consists of works of art by Stuart Sherman including drawings, sketches and drafts for sculpture, collage, as well as notes for visual art works. Two folders of mold damaged artworks have been removed from the bulk of other artworks and given a separate box. </p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES VII: Photographic Materials</emph> includes all negatives, transparencies, contact sheets, and photographic prints from the collection. Some prints and contact sheets include photographer name, performance title, date and other identifying information. </p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES VIII: Slides</emph> includes two binders of slides documenting Sherman's artistic output. The original order of slides has been preserved, though no obvious rule of arrangement appears to have existed. Some slides include detailed identifying information. </p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES IX: Video</emph> contains all videotaped material by or pertaining to Stuart Sherman. Paper material which was found within original video containers may be found in Subseries C. Of the media portion, researcher access is limited to Subseries A: Video Recordings – Access Copies.
