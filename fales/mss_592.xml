    <abstract id="aspace_460a15f39b2f2536f823a2644d20d9ae">Stephen Mass is an entrepreneur who co-founded the Mudd Club located at 77 White Street in downtown New York City in 1978 along with art curator Diego Cortez and Anya Phillips. The venue became a focal point of the downtown music, art, and cultural scene in the late 20th century, showcasing the intersections of popular and avant-garde performance culture, gender and sexuality, celebrity culture, music, visual art, fashion, film, and nightlife. The Stephen Mass Papers (inclusive dates 1940-2019, bulk dates 1978-2009) documents the founding and operation of the Mudd Club in New York City, Mass's other entrepreneurial ventures in New York, and his nightclubs and restaurants in Berlin, as well as his personal life and family history. Consisting of both paper and electronic formats, the collection includes extensive notebooks and notes containing the planning and working notes for Mass's various endeavors, financial and legal documents, promotional materials for events (such as posters, flyers, and newsletters), ephemera (differentiated from promotional material, as promotional material Mass collected from other clubs or organizations), press coverage, and photographic materials such as prints, negatives, and slides.</abstract>

<p>During processing in 2021, original folders were retained whenever possible. Where appropriate, materials were rehoused in new acid-free archival folders. Loose photographic prints and negatives were rehoused in sleeves. Photographic slides were rehoused in sleeves and folders.

<p>Stephen Mass is an entrepreneur who co-founded the Mudd Club located at 77 White Street in downtown New York City in 1978 along with art curator Diego Cortez and Anya Phillips. The venue became a focal point of the downtown music, art, and cultural scene in the late 20th century, showcasing the intersections of popular and avant-garde performance culture, gender and sexuality, celebrity culture, music, visual art, fashion, film, and nightlife. The Mudd Club closed in 1983, after which Mass embarked on other endeavors in New York and Berlin, such as founding Mudd Club Berlin in 2001, restaurant ownership, nonprofit work, teaching, and writing.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Stephen Mass Papers (inclusive dates 1940-2019, bulk dates 1978-2009) documents the founding and operation of the Mudd Club in New York City, Mass's other entrepreneurial ventures in New York, and his nightclubs and restaurants in Berlin, as well as his personal life and family history. The bulk of the materials are dated 1978-2009, which is when the majority of these entrepreneurial ventures took place. The more inclusive dates of 1940 to 2019 include materials from his youth, retrospective articles, press, and ephemera regarding the Mudd Club, and manuscript drafts of his unpublished memoir.</p><p>Consisting of both paper and electronic formats, the collection includes extensive notebooks and notes containing the planning and working notes for Mass's various endeavors, financial and legal documents, promotional materials for events (such as posters, flyers, and newsletters), ephemera (differentiated from promotional material, as promo material Mass collected from other clubs or organizations), press coverage, and photographic materials such as prints, negatives, and slides. The majority of the collection pertains to the management and operation of the Mudd Club in New York City and the various nightclubs and restaurants that Mass owned and operated in Berlin, Germany, including the Mudd Club Berlin. The large number of photographic prints, negatives, and slides in the collection document Mass's work as a nightclub entrepreneur and photographer, with images documenting the condition of venue spaces (particularly in Berlin), parties and events (particularly at the Mudd Club), and images of his own personal travel and photographic subjects. The collection also includes handwritten notes, diary entries, and typescript manuscript drafts for Mass's unpublished memoir, and interview transcripts and correspondence with Tim Lawrence regarding the Mudd Club.</p>  </scopecontent>

Materials documenting the operations of the Mudd Club Berlin in 1999 and the 2000s include financial and legal documents; floor plans; correspondence; business proposals; planning and working notes in notebooks, notepads, and calendars; business cards; mailing lists; press coverage; two company stamps; and promotional materials. There are also photographic negatives and prints documenting the condition of venue spaces, with a smaller extent of material documenting parties and events. Much of the financial and legal documents pertain to loans, contracts, building applications, zoning, and noise complaints, among other issues. Some of these subjects also come up in the planning and working notes of the series, which also include research materials, inventories, diagrams, and payment notes.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_21ba3439e47ca61420c998e3418a6fb8"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Materials are arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_29bb099ee4e91c730f26d4df65350a77" level="file"><did><unittitle>Administrative, Financial Documents</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2004/2009" type="inclusive">2004-2009</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
