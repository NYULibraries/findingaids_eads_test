    <abstract id="aspace_9613c5206035e92a1257b0672901315e">Maria Irene Fornés (b. 1930) is a Cuban-American avant-garde dramatist, director, and teacher of playwriting.  Her work, most particularly associated with both the Off-Broadway and Off-Off Broadway movements of the 1960s and New York City's "downtown scene" of the 1980s, has had a major influence on several generations of American playwrights.  Winner of 9 Obies, as well as numerous additional awards and honors, Fornés wrote over 50 works for the stage between 1961 and 2001.  Her best-known pieces are <title render="italic">Fefu and Her Friends</title> (1977), <title render="italic">The Danube</title> (1982), <title render="italic">Mud</title> (1983), and <title render="italic">Promenade</title> (1965), a musical play.  The papers document more than half of Fornés' entire <emph render="italic">oevre</emph>, in original and annotated playscripts, libretti, and adapted works dating from 1961 through 2001; they also document Fornés' writing process through notes, scenarios, character sketches, and other writings. The remainder of the papers consists of business and professional documents, personal correspondence, family papers, and subject files.  The entire collection spans 1909 through 2005, but most of its materials date from the 1980s and 1990s.</abstract>

<p>The papers span 1909 to 2005, with the bulk from the 1980s and 1990s, and were created during the course of Irene Fornés' playwriting and directing, teaching, administrative and organizational activities and personal relationships.

The collection illustrates writing and research processes of a playwright, teaching playwriting, and some aspects of the business and financial sides of the life of a working artist; it also includes personal correspondence and family documents used as source materials for dramatic pieces, and internal and administrative documents of an ethnic theater arts organization.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Maria Irene Fornés is a Cuban-American avant-garde dramatist, director, and teacher of playwriting.  Her work, most particularly associated with both the Off-Broadway and Off-Off Broadway movements of the 1960s and the "downtown scene" of New York City in the 1980s, has had a major influence on several generations of American playwrights. Winner of 9 Obies, as well as numerous additional awards and honors, Fornés wrote over 50 works for the stage between 1961 and 2001. Subjects of her work have included women's lives, lesbian love, Cuban culture, poverty, and emigration; and themes have featured social, political, and interpersonal power relationships.</p><p>Fornés was born on May 14, 1930, in Havana, Cuba, the youngest of six children of Carlos Luis and Carmen Hismenia (Collado) Fornés. Her father, a self-taught intellectual, worked at modest white-collar government  jobs and her mother had been a teacher before marriage.  The family was poor, but cultured. Fornés, with less than four years of formal schooling, was mostly educated at home.</p><p>At age 15, Irene (as she began to call herself) emigrated to the United States with her mother and a sister. There she worked at a number of routine jobs to support herself, including in a ribbon factory. In 1947 Fornés took a folk-dancing class at New York City's New School through which she was introduced  to Greenwich Village's Bohemian arts and culture scene. She soon moved to Greenwich Village, where she continued to live for the next forty years. During the 1950s she studied painting with abstract impressionist Hans Hoffman; from 1954 through 1957 she was an expatriate, traveling in Europe and living in Paris with American writer Harriet Sohmers Zwerling. In Paris she met Susan Sontag and they became lovers. After her return to the United States the two lived together for several years and Fornés worked as a textile designer.  </p><p>According to Fornés' account, it was through her relationship with Sontag that she began to write plays—accidentally, she claimed, in an attempt to help Sontag begin her own writing by demonstrating how easy it was to start. Fornés' first play, written in Spanish, <title render="italic">La Viuda</title> (<title render="italic">The Widow</title>), was written in 1961, followed by <title render="italic">There, You Died!</title> (renamed <title render="italic">Tango Palace</title>)—her first play in English—in 1963, which was immediately accepted and staged by a San Francisco theater company. Fornés, who had heretofore never received any theatrical or dramatic training, joined the Playwrights Unit of the Actors Studio and took a Method acting course.  The years 1965 and 1966 saw the writing  and production of Fornés' only commercial success, <title render="italic">Promenade</title>, a play with music written by Al Carmines, a colleague at the Judson Poets Theater; and <title render="italic">The Office</title>, her only foray into Broadway theater, which closed after previews. After this early turn towards mainstream theater, Fornés' plays were performed exclusively Off-Broadway (and its equivalent venues in other parts of the country as well as in Europe) or in college or university productions. She began to direct most of her own works and directed, adapted, and translated other playwrights' work as well; she also collaborated with composers to create operas. Perhaps her best-known plays, produced in the 1970s and 1980s, are <title render="italic">Fefu and Her Friends</title> (1977), <title render="italic">The Danube</title> (1983), and <title render="italic">Mud</title> (1983). She was honored with awards and obtained artist residencies, grants, and commissioned works. Nearly two dozen of her plays were published, although a significant number of them were performed not more than once or twice or were never staged beyond a workshop performance.  </p><p>As recognition of Fornés' plays spread, it brought invitations to visit other countries. Her extensive travels to present or discuss her work included trips to Mexico, India, Japan, Germany, North Africa, the Middle East and the Soviet Union.
 
Irene Fornés' work as a teacher of playwriting and mentor to emerging playwrights has been recognized and praised as much, if not more, than her plays. The many workshops, classes, and lectures she presented,  including her long association with the Hispanic American theater organization INTAR (International Arts Relations, Inc.) exercised a considerable influence on emerging playwrights, in particular a generation of young Latino playwrights. Fornés' organizational work was important as well.  In addition to her service on the council of the Dramatists' Guild of America, in 1973 she co-founded New York Theatre Strategy, a writer-centered cooperative theater production company and spent so much time acting variously as its producer, fundraiser, costumer, publicist and administrator that for several years she laid aside her own writing and directing.</p><p>In 2001 illness forced Irene Fornés to retire.  Her last completed play (first produced in 2000) was <title render="italic">Letters from Cuba</title>; her last working play was<title render="italic">27 Rue de Fleurus</title>, a piece about the life of Gertrude Stein.</p>  </bioghist>

It also includes a script for <title render="italic">Minuski</title>, a previously-unknown work, and <title render="italic">La Plaza Chica</title>, Fornés' translation and adaptation of her play <title render="italic">Abingdon Square</title> into Spanish. In addition, there are scores for some of her plays with songs; a libretto for an opera; and scripts and staging notes for Fornés' directing, translating, and adapting of other writers' plays or stories (such as Henrik Ibsen's <title render="italic">Hedda Gabler</title> and Anton Chekhov's <title render="italic">Uncle Vanya</title> and <title render="italic">Drowning</title>). There are numerous drafts or versions of Fornes' scripts written, edited, or adapted for different productions of a play, or revised after the completion of a run of a particular production.   Many of the scripts are not complete, and most of them have Fornés' handwritten--often extensive--annotations and revisions.  Production records for various stagings of her own plays and productions she directed of others' works include memos, notes, set designs, cast lists, and calls for auditions.</p></scopecontent><c

It includes notes, scenarios, stories and character studies; dialogs, monologues and individual lines; ideas for plays, films and dances; journal and diary entries; fragments of narratives and numerous other types of writings in process; and a small amount of correspondence. Some of the writings are typed, and many are handwritten.  Formats range from notebooks to the backs of envelopes and smaller scraps. Almost none of the items are dated, with the exception of a few materials from the 1980s to the 1990s.  Most of the materials originally received in labeled folders retain their original folder titles (these are enclosed by quotation marks); the remaining materials have been placed in folders labeled "miscellaneous short notes."</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref328" level="file"><did><unittitle>"A.E."</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container

In addition, the series includes flyers, correspondence, exercise instructions, participant lists, play notes, and drawings that pertain to, or that arose from, Irene Fornés' teaching and playwriting workshops. She briefly taught elementary school students, but the bulk of her students were college students and adults who were emerging playwrights.  Because Fornés' method for teaching plays included close collaboration, a number of these scripts were co-written by several different students as well as with Fornés herself (<title render="italic">Meche</title> is one clear example). In addition to those who received formal instruction from Fornés through workshops, lectures or classes, the series also includes materials from informal "students" of hers who may never have been enrolled in any of the courses she taught--aspiring playwrights whom she seems to have mentored or for whose work she seems to have provided criticism.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref482"
