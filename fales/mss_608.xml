    <abstract id="aspace_735769a87dcdbc6419c02c66a4ba4e20">Mary Harron (1953- ) is a Canadian-born filmmaker, screenwriter, and journalist. Harron's journalism dates from primarily the 1960s-1990s, where she focused on music and culture, particularly the early punk scenes in both London and New York. In the late 1980s, Harron began her film career by writing and directing documentaries for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). In the 1990s, after moving to New York, she worked as a producer for the PBS show <emph render='italic'>Edge</emph>, which focused on pop culture. In 1996, Harron wrote and directed her first feature film, <emph render='italic'>I Shot Andy Warhol</emph>. She went on to write and direct <emph render='italic'>American Psycho</emph> (2000) and <emph render='italic'>The Notorious Bettie Page</emph> (2005), and direct <emph render='italic'>Charlie Says</emph> (2018). As of 2025, she has continued to direct feature films, television episodes, and miniseries. The Mary Harron Papers (dated 1939-2018) consist of materials in paper, electronic, and analog audiovisual formats created and collected by Harron documenting her career as a screenwriter, filmmaker, and journalist. Materials documenting her career as a filmmaker include research materials, pre-production documentation, and production documentation (e.g., schedules, casting, scripts), as well as clippings and publications that contain reviews or served as source material. Notable projects documented in this collection include <emph render="italic">I Shot Andy Warhol</emph>, <emph render="italic">American Psycho</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Notorious Bettie Page</emph>. The collection also documents Harron's career as a journalist, focusing on early punk music and culture reporting. Music and culture journalism is documented through notes and transcripts of interviews, interview recordings, and published writings.</abstract>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At the time of accessioning, materials were rehoused in archival boxes, with loose materials foldered in their original order. Born-digital items were identified, physically separated, and inventoried, but were not forensically imaged, analyzed, or described. Materials in Boxes 14-15 were vacuumed and cleaned due to the presence of water damage and minor mold. </p><p>At the time of 2024 accessioning, materials with evidence of mold were photocopied and the originals were discarded.</p><p>At the time of processing in 2025, the collection was arranged and described into series. Materials were placed into acid-free legal boxes and folders, and oversized materials were rehoused in appropriately sized boxes. Scrapbook pages were removed from their binders, and additional items were removed from non-archival sleeves. Duplicate publications and documents, publications widely available online or in NYU's catalog holdings, and documents with sensitive personal information were removed.</p><p>50 CDs, DVDs, floppy disks, and flash drives were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.</p>  </processinfo>

Most of the files cover her writing on punk music and music in general, but there are files related to other cultural topics, such as television and theater. Materials include drafts and manuscripts, interview transcripts, interview recordings, research files, correspondence, and final published versions of Harron's writing for publications including <emph render='italic'>New Statesman</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Punk</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Melody Maker</emph>, and <emph render='italic'>The Guardian</emph>. Harron's interview transcripts and recordings of such iconic bands as the Sex Pistols, and her writing for <emph render='italic'>Punk</emph> (an early publication that focused on the counterculture) reflect her central role in documenting this emerging category of music. Also included are notes and reading for a course Harron taught on subcultures in 1980.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_84ac486d6dbaca34130e271d06b217f3"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged
