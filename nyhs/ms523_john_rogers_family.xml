    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Born on October 30, 1829 in Salem, Massachusetts to Sara Ellen Derby and John Rogers, John Rogers, Jr. grew up in Cincinnati and rural Northampton, MA before the Rogers family moved to Roxbury, where he attended grammar school. In 1844 he entered the Boston English High School where he developed an interest and talent in drawing. However, as the descendent of a long lineage of Puritan ministers and merchants, pressure from his father and uncle led him to start a more practical career. After graduation in 1846, John Rogers, Jr. began work as a dry goods clerk in Boston and in 1848 took a position as a surveyor's assistant with the Boston Water Works, on the recommendation of his uncle Henry Bromfield Rogers, a Water Commissioner.</p><p>In December of 1848 John Rogers, Jr. suffered from a terrible cold and acute inflammation of the eyes that forced him to leave his job and seek treatment. He would make trips to Boston for entertainment, and there met a friend who first introduced him to clay modeling. While his eye-sight was so drastically impaired, Rogers turned to modeling for enjoyment. With little improvement in his eyes by July of 1849, his Grandmother Derby and uncle Henry Rogers sent him on a trip to Spain, where he spent more time sketching sights than recovering.</p><p>By July 1850 John Rogers, Jr. was well enough again to take a new position in a machine shop for the Amoskeag Corporation in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he worked until the fall of 1852. Then he moved to New York City to work at the Novelty Iron Works for a year before returning to his position in Manchester. By the winter of 1855-56, Rogers had become a Master Mechanic at the Amoskeag Machine Shop, and in April 1856 decided to move to Hannibal, Missouri to take a position as the Master Mechanic of the Hannibal and St. Joseph Rail Road. However, this job ended abruptly only a year and a half later during the Panic of 1857.</p><p>Throughout his years in the machinist trade, Rogers had continued to sculpt clay models and had created a number of small works. The sudden interruption of his career in 1857 quickly led to his decision to improve his skill by moving to Paris in September 1858 to study sculpture. However, discouraged by the minimal earnings of sculpture, in April 1859 Rogers returned home to the United States where a few months later in September he found a position at the surveyor's office of Chicago. He unexpectedly experienced his first success as a sculptor in a Charity Bazaar. His celebrated first piece, "Checkers at the Farm," was soon followed by "The Slave Auction," which took him to New York to finally start a career in sculpture. </p><p>In 1863 Rogers officially determined his business model of "large sales and small profits." During the years of the Civil War, Rogers, a Unionist, produced statues on contemporary topics and attained household renown. As Rogers' career took off, his studio in New York soon became a public showroom. His fame spread nationally from frequent reviews in newspapers, magazine, and trade journals. Some of his most notable pieces and subjects were statues of Gen. Reynolds, Henry Ward Beecher, Abraham Lincoln, Edwin M. Stanton, and Gen. Grant.</p><p>John Rogers, Jr. married Harriet Moore Francis in 1865, and together they had seven children, six of whom survived to adulthood: John, Katherine Rebecca, Charles Francis, Derby, Alexander Parker, and David Francis. Throughout his career Rogers was able to make a comfortable living. However after his retirement in 1894 and over thirty years of work, interest in his miniature group sculptures lessened. He moved permanently to his summer home in New Canaan, where he died in 1904.</p><p>The Rogers family's genealogy dates as far back as to the 16th century. Originally located in England, men of the Rogers family began a tradition of careers in the ministry. In 1636 Reverend Nathaniel Rogers moved the family to America, where the family took root in the surrounding areas of Boston and carried on the occupational tradition of Puritan ministers and New England merchants, providing their descendents with a respected family name. Though John Rogers, Sr. was also a merchant, he did not experience the same success and wealth that his predecessors had. However, in 1827, at the age of 27 Rogers married a 22 year-old Sarah Ellen Derby, daughter of the Salem banker John Derby. Together they had 7 children and moved several times in their early life, finally settling down in Roxbury, Massachusetts. John Rogers, Sr. and Sarah Ellen Derby remained close to Rogers, Sr.'s brother Henry Bromfield Rogers, a member of the Municipal Council and a Water Commissioner of Boston. H. B. Rogers played a significant role in the early life and career of John Rogers, Jr. providing connections and financial support when needed. The Rogers family was close and corresponded frequently amongst siblings and parents.</p><p>Source: Wallace, David H. John Rogers: The People's Sculptor.

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Rogers Family Papers documents the family life and career of John Rogers, Jr. (1829-1904), the famous sculptor and former machinist, as well as Rogers family members dating back to the early 17th century. Notable ancestors included are Reverend John Rogers (1572-1636) of Dedham, Essex, descendant of the Martyr John Rogers and Reverend John Rogers (1630-1684), 5th President of Harvard University (1682-1684). Divided into two series, John Rogers, Jr. and the Rogers Family, the former consists of both personal and business letters, writings, drawings, and financial documents accumulated by John Rogers, Jr. through out his life. The latter series contains personal correspondence created or received by the immediate family members John Rogers, Jr. such as his sisters, father, or children. The second series also holds sermons, correspondence, and journals of Rogers family ancestors passed down from one generation to the next, and genealogical accounts, obituaries and timelines put together by later generations.</p><p>The letters of John Rogers, Jr. date back to his youth in Roxbury, Massachusetts and continue through his occupation as a machinist in New Hampshire, New York, and Missouri to his later career as a sculptor in New York City and New Canaan, Connecticut. As a sculptor of renown in the late 19th century, the correspondence of John Rogers, Jr. includes letters to and from some prominent figures, Henry Ward Beecher, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Grover Cleveland. Rogers' sculptures often reflected themes of the Civil War which included and enthused some of these men, prompting notes of thanks and recognition. His lengthier communication with Henry Ward Beecher followed Rogers' 1860 exhibition of the first of a series of Civil War series called "The Slave Auction." The papers of John Rogers, Jr. additionally include personal writings and drawings that he created primarily in young adulthood, such as sketches from his trip to Spain in 1849 as well as animated short stories. John Rogers, Jr. also preserved important letters, contracts, and patents from his career as a sculptor. These records have been arranged in the last subseries and largely include correspondence relating to exhibitions of Rogers Groups and donations of statues by Rogers to museums and galleries. </p><p>The Rogers Family Papers consist of the correspondence of immediate family members of John Rogers, Jr., including his parents John Rogers, Sr. and Sarah Ellen Derby, siblings, most prominently Ellen Rogers, wife Harriet M. F. Rogers, and children, primarily Derby and Katherine R. Rogers. The family correspondence is largely comprised of communication between family members, but also in the case of Derby and Katherine R. Rogers, business correspondence relating to the Rogers Groups after their father's death. Rogers Family Papers also consist of the letters, diaries and sermons of ancestors, many of whom were Protestant religious leaders. The final subseries of the collection contains genealogical records collected by the younger generation of the Rogers family. Included are notes and letters, timelines, a scrapbook, and an extensive hand-written timeline dating back to the 15th century. </p>  </scopecontent>

While at the Amoskeag Corporation in New Hampshire, Rogers filled a notebook with sketches of the various machinery he used and found in the Machine Shop. Rogers' trip to Spain in 1849 due to lingering illness and inability to work produced a number of sketches of sights, such as Gibraltar and the Alhambra. The travel journal documents his daily activities, his sometimes animated experiences on board the ship, and his encounters with Spanish natives and cultural events. The creative writings of John Rogers, Jr. include short stories and poems complemented with drawings as well as numerous copies of press releases for his sculpted groups.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref40_3ji" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Drawings of Machinery from Machine Shops of the Amoskeag Corporation, Manchester, N.H.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1854-1855</unitdate><container id="aspace_4468dba40142e3d63394edcbca7565e0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_4468dba40142e3d63394edcbca7565e0" type="Folder">14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref41_7tw" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Passport, Travel Journal, Sketches and Map from Trips to Spain and Cienfuegos</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1849-1858</unitdate><container id="aspace_bfb243fcece881885737128f01cb2c0a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_bfb243fcece881885737128f01cb2c0a" type="Folder">15</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref42_uwe" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Poems and Writings by John Rogers, Jr.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_9502bdc53a1e443bdfcf66d72b9f4190" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_9502bdc53a1e443bdfcf66d72b9f4190" type="Folder">16</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref44_9po" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries III: Business Papers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1916/1936" type="inclusive">1848-1971</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a318ed9c9c498aef227306ff7c0ee1b0"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This subseries is comprised of John Rogers, Jr.'s patents of the Rogers Groups, ledger books, bills, business correspondence, papers and articles written about his Groups, and ephemera of past exhibitions of his statues.

Additionally included are newspapers preserved by family members from as early as 1723 and 19th century paper currency. This subseries is arranged by person and chronologically within each folder. Many of the documents included are extremely aged and fragile. These documents also include a number of sermon books and notebooks written or used by some of the eldest members of the Rogers ancestry, as well as a genealogical timeline of the Foxcroft Family, related through Anna Foxcroft who married Reverend Daniel Rogers in 1748, created in 1730.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref75_z6t" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Reverend John Rogers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Undated-1636</unitdate><container id="aspace_9850388b359787ffc969e4e1af1e022d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5B</container><container parent="aspace_9850388b359787ffc969e4e1af1e022d" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref76_1y4" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Reverend Nathaniel Rogers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1718-Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_c95fcb99b100246909c2f0753296ca50" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5B</container><container parent="aspace_c95fcb99b100246909c2f0753296ca50" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref77_ing" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Reverend John Rogers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1742</unitdate><container id="aspace_9c32de69ced9f59725df57cd283ba4c6" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5B</container><container parent="aspace_9c32de69ced9f59725df57cd283ba4c6" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref78_wcd" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Daniel Denison Rogers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1805-1825</unitdate><container id="aspace_9689ebd3b58e2a0db07921139084c24e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5B</container><container parent="aspace_9689ebd3b58e2a0db07921139084c24e" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref79_uws" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Poetry Book of Catherine R.
