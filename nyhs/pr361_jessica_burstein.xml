Her portfolio of images from the Sunny Atlantic Beach Club on Long Island and photographs from the television show "New York Undercover" are also in the collection.</p><p>In addition to photographs, the collection includes memorabilia related to the photographic subjects.

<p>The collection is organized in six series:</p><p>I. Yankee Stadium Construction<lb/> <lb/></p><p>II.

Various Subjects<lb/> <lb/></p><p>These series generally follow the subject categories as defined by the photographer, Jessica Burstein. For the first five series, with minor exception, the photographs remain in the boxes as presented to N-YHS by Burstein. There was no particular arrangement of the photographs in the original boxes; some slight rearrangement was done during processing.</p><p>The sixth series was a "mix" of subjects. The subject or context of some of these photos was identified by Burstein, but not for most. Accordingly, the processing archivist arranged much of this series.</p><p>Burstein's notes and captions are found on many of the photographs and on the boxes themselves. In April 2018, after the collection had been donated to N-YHS, Burstein went through many of the photographs to add identifying information where it was lacking; many of these added notes were written in blue pencil and are identifiable in that way.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Jessica Burstein, born in Nassau County on Long Island, was educated in Switzerland and New York. From an early age she developed an interest in photography, having a dark room by age 11. She began her career in 1974 as the first female staff photographer for the NBC television network. She remained at NBC for about four years taking pictures of everything from news events, such as the 1976 Democratic National Convention, to television shows and movies, such as "Saturday Night Live" and the miniseries "King," about Martin Luther King, Jr. After leaving NBC, Burstein worked freelance on various projects and commissions.</p><p>Burstein is a member of an accomplished family, notably in the field of law. Both of her parents were lawyers; her mother, Beatrice S. Burstein, was a judge in the New York state system, becoming a member of the state Supreme Court in 1972. Burstein had four siblings, some of whom also entered the legal profession; these included her older sister, Karen Burstein, who has held positions in all three branches of New York state's government over the course of her career. So it is perhaps not surprising that, by the early 1990s, Jessica considered a switch to law when her photography career hit a dry spell. However, when she mentioned this to Elaine Kaufman, the owner of Elaine's Restaurant on New York's Upper East Side urged her to stay with photography and gave Burstein permission to take photographs in the restaurant, which Kaufman displayed on a wall there. Burstein continued to do so through the closing of the restaurant in 2011.</p><p>Burstein had been a regular at Elaine's since the 1970s as her photography career led her into the celebrity circles that frequented that place. Still, it was only in 1990 when Kaufman attended an exhibition of Burstein's work and acquired a triptych of her Truman Capote photographs that Kaufman began to engage with Burstein as a serious photographer and advocated for her work. It was through this connection with Kaufman and Burstein's exposure at the restaurant, that Dick Wolf, the executive producer of the <emph render="italic">Law &amp; Order</emph> television series, asked Burstein to photograph the crime scenes staged for the show in anticipation of a book he visualized on the subject. Burstein took these pictures over the course of the next decade, which eventually led to the publication of "<emph render="italic">Law &amp; Order</emph>: Crime Scenes" in 2003. Along the way, Burstein's role expanded to become the official photographer for <emph render="italic">Law &amp; Order</emph> and its spin-offs through the 1990s and into the 2000s. Burstein was also the photographer for another Dick Wolf television production, <emph render="italic">New York Undercover</emph>. </p><p>Burstein's connection with Kaufman also led her to the commission to document a historic New York event: the construction of the new Yankee Stadium from 2006 to 2009. At Elaine's restaurant, Burstein had met George Steinbrenner, principal owner of the Yankees, and Randy Levine, the organization's president. On Burstein's occasional visits to the Steinbrenner suite, she would take photos that Steinbrenner liked. Consequently, Levine suggested that Burstein submit a proposal to get the commission to photograph the stadium construction project, which Burstein won.  </p><p>Burstein's career includes other publications, exhibitions, and awards. The above items are emphasized in this note because they are the most relevant to the collection held by New-York Historical Society. In 2017, Burstein left New York to live in Camden, Maine. At that time, she donated to N-YHS that part of her work most related to New York City.</p><p>(The above note was based on various sources, including her biography on <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://jessicaburstein.photoshelter.com/">photoshelter.com</extref>; a 2015 interview with <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href=" http://www.nypress.com/local-news/20150121/seeing-the-city-through-a-photographers-lens ">Straus Media</extref>; Burstein's reminiscences in Amy Philip Penn's "Elaine's: The Rise of One of New York's Most Legendary Restaurants"; a 2017 <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/nyregion/grace-notes-jessica-burstein-leaving-new-york.html">New York Times article </extref>; and others.)</p>  </bioghist>

Steinbrenner III (often referred to as "The Boss"), constructed a new stadium for the baseball team from 2006-2009. Groundbreaking was on 16 August 2006. During construction, which ran through the 2007 and 2008 seasons, the Yankees continued to play in the old stadium, which was just a block or so away. The 2009 season was the first played in the new stadium, starting with Opening Day on 16 April 2009. The Yankees had a successful year, winning the World Series (their 27th championship) in their first year in the new ballpark. The Yankees' opponent in the Series were the Philadelphia Phillies; the final, clinching game of the Series was played at the new stadium. Among the Yankees' leading players on that team were the "Core Four" of Derek Jeter, Andy Pettite, Mariano Rivera, and Jorge Posada, as well as Mark Teixeira, Alex Rodriguez, and others.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_cc7ce4cec0b625c3ff075cae80b0e503"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The series primarily consists of 1000 color photographs, principally of the construction of the new Yankee Stadium from 2007-2009 (most of the photographs are undated so it is not clear if any date from the earliest construction in 2006). The bulk are 11x14 inches, though there are several larger and smaller in size. The construction photos provide both panoramic views of the work's progress, as well as detailed views of particular aspects of the work, such as placing the signage in the outfield, laying the turf, unboxing the memorials moved from Monument Park, and doing ironwork. Close-ups of construction workers appear frequently. While the crews consisted mostly of men, several women crew members are found in the images as well.</p><p>In addition to the construction, there are photographs from the Yankees' opening season at the new park, as well as some final photos of the last days in the old Yankee Stadium. Shots from the Yankees' World Series appearance are in the series. Derek Jeter appears in many of these photos, and other then-current players appear as well. Former players, including Yogi Berra and Reggie Jackson, appear in some photos, as do other notables, such as George Steinbrenner, Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and Michael Bloomberg.</p><p>In addition to photographs, the series holds some memorabilia, including a poster, pins, a tee shirt, and some documents.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_2d803ad7b5dd74b44ce6eba3ecd6887a"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Most of the photographs remain in the boxes as received from the photographer. There is no particular order to them within boxes or across them. There are multiple prints of the same image, often found in various boxes and sizes. During processing, photographs signed by Burstein or annotated were placed at the front of the boxes. Also pulled together in this way were photos of game action, players, notable people, crowds at games, and other such photos not related to the construction process.</p><p>In the inventory below, the first nine boxes hold the 11x14 (and some 8x10) prints. These are followed by a box and a flat file of larger prints, and memorabilia.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_bd48dc64d22f6c984e95ae48ce12f852" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yankee Stadium Construction Photographs (Box 1 of 9)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_3a35bf8a83958f12157d527e9c5a61c4" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_190de194f7aa3cf69bcf968bf9b25848" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yankee Stadium Construction Photographs (Box 2 of 9)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_c0f4a383a7d95192b7ec09364c02528b" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_91b1180f4867693280ee07a2a83086a3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yankee Stadium Construction Photographs (Box 3 of 9)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_cd7d57d2362f4e3b047bfe5e0ba73139" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f6b46656642e5da3106bc69bcb0e354d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yankee Stadium Construction Photographs (Box 4 of 9)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_75af591f80b02390ff2bdf4d94cf2eb5" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_5c0f14eb47b063b9a5bc86764782fcbc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yankee Stadium Construction Photographs (Box 5 of 9)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_aaad93f57974f23e0402cb8340353b78" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_2c1863c5db249a750e428de7caf66181" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yankee Stadium Construction Photographs (Box 6 of 9)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_081eeff5fa172ca626e17bcfc868422b" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref52_rv3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yankee Stadium Construction Photographs (Box 7 of 9)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_7b2cfa189b250a57a0dc51c631970805" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref54_l3c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yankee Stadium Construction Photographs (Box 8 of 9)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_951f6dcd8937d7f2a541c253ffe84f7b" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref55_xd5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yankee Stadium Construction Photographs (Box 9 of 9)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_67da74934dc83a4fd5029e2b900829e1" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_482cee7fc3060f7067af58f2298808af" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yankee Stadium Construction Photographs (Flat box)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_8954dc47c955cf00b9b3f28d84a6aaab" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">31</container><container id="aspace_395b7033ef90893defe6af992cdd4f88" parent="aspace_8954dc47c955cf00b9b3f28d84a6aaab" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2_p3o" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yankee Stadium Photographs </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_119d6120f531c6c9ce8c640bb1fa0b55" label="Graphic Materials" type="Folder">FF-1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_15c054c7a327ae813d49c8037bfdf75c"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes five color photographs on foamcore.

It would run for 20 seasons, until 2010, totalling 456 episodes, making it one of the longest running primetime TV series in American history. The one hour episodes would open with the discovery of a crime (typically a murder), with the balance of the time split between the police investigation and arrest of a suspect and the ensuing prosecution and trial. The show was so successful that it became a "brand" with spin-offs: "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent" (2001-2011), "Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury" (2005-2006), "Law &amp; Order: LA" (2010-2011), and "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit," which began in 1999 and remains on the air as of 2018. There was also a 1998 movie "Exiled: A Law &amp; Order Movie," starring Chris Noth, who appeared on the TV show for its first five seasons.</p><p>Over the years, the show's cast constantly evolved. Some of its major longstanding stars, who appear in Burstein's photographs here, include S. Epatha Merkerson (17 seasons), Sam Waterson (16 seasons), Jerry Orbach (12 seasons), Steven Hill (10 seasons), and Jesse L. Martin (9 seasons).</p><p>In 1993, the producer of "Law &amp; Order,"'s producer, Dick Wolf, approached Jessica Burstein to photograph the show's crime scenes, which she did over the course of the next several years. These were eventually formed into a book by Wolf and Burstein: "Law &amp; Order: Crime Scenes," published by Barnes &amp; Noble Books in 2003. In addition to her crime scene assignment, Burstein's role was also expanded to be a unit photographer for the show.</p><p>(The above note was based primarily on information from NBC's website and the introduction to Dick Wolf's crime scenes book.)</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_f779d2f0fd2a96933cbaff26bae708fe"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The series includes photographs, documents and memorabilia related to the show and spin-offs. </p><p>A large number of the photographs are of the show's set, cast, and crew.

To a large degree it appears that these photographs date from the 1970s and were likely taken by Burstein in connection with her work as a photographer for NBC. In this context, much of the content includes NBC television sports and news announcers, talk show hosts, TV show actors and actresses, as well as musicians, political figures and events, and others.</p><p>The series also holds some photos from before Burstein's time at NBC, including anti-war demonstrations of about 1971. More photos date from the late 1970s and up to 2017, and include various celebrities from the sports, entertainment and literary worlds. There are also sets of photographs of business families, likely done by Burstein on a commission basis. Most of the photographs center on people, but there are a few New York City views. It also seems likely that there are some photographs here from the <emph render="italic">New York Undercover</emph> television series and from Elaine's Restaurant that were not boxed separately by the photographer and were not recognizable as such by the processing archivist.</p><p>Because of the broad range of subjects, the container list below includes more specifics as to the content.</p><p>In addition to photographs the series includes a few documents, mostly related to Burstein's photo assignments. These include a small number of NBC call sheets and cast lists; similar documents related to the filming of John Cassavetes's movie "Gloria"; and teletypes reporting the resignation of Richard Nixon from the presidency. </p><p>Finally, the series holds various items of memorabilia, including tee shirts and political and other pins.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_ae1bb3024f8ab8c72e7a3fde32240de6"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged first by format: photographs, followed by documents and memorabilia. </p><p>The photographs are arranged by subject matter. When presented to N-YHS most of the photographs in this series were in no particular order. The processing archivist arranged them into categories and particular subjects. The sequence as see in the container list below is roughly as follows: NBC photographs specifically identified as such by Burstein; NBC telecasts and on-air personalities; political matters (demonstrations, conventions, activists, politicians); sports figures; entertainers; business, literary and other figures; and miscellaneous portraits, street scenes, etc. </p></arrangement><c id="aspace_3efc2663ecd472457e3a591ea0ffb870" level="file"><did><unittitle>NBC Studios Photographs (8x10)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1940s-1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_f658dc10823a59c8625e638abda5cb30" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">24</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2a46c65f505c436e1731f0588692e2e5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>7 historical photos from NBC: the National Broadcasting Company Election Chart of 1948, showing Dewey conceding at 11:12 AM, with NBC tabulators; John F.
