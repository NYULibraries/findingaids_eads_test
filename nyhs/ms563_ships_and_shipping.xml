<p>The bulk of the collection is arranged in alphabetical order by name of ship. At the close of the collection are three folders with documents related to various ships. Two of these folders have a rough theme (Hudson River ships and import certifications).

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The collection, which was formed by New-York Historical Society over time from various donations and purchases, includes a wide variety of documents with a loosely-defined thematic connection to ships and shipping. Roughly 175 ships are represented in the collection, though often with just one document. Bills of lading and invoices, receipts, account statements, and other financial papers are most commonly found, though other documents include passes for ships; cargo manifests; depositions and other statements in connection with legal or other matters; sailing instructions and agreements; records of prizes won from captured ships; logbooks; crew lists; insurance policies; import certifications; and others.</p><p>The collection also ranges widely over time, from a 1660-1663 journal (in Dutch) kept aboard the ships <emph render="italic">Golden Beaver</emph> and <emph render="italic">Golden Otter</emph> to a 1942 transcript concerning a fire aboard the S.S. <emph render="italic">Normandie</emph> at New York's Pier 88. Most documents, though, seem to date from the second half of the 1700s and the first half of the 1800s.</p><p>Despite the random nature of the collection and the lack of deep documentation for most ships, there are several folders that include particularly rich materials. These include, for example, the papers of the sloop <emph render="italic">Experiment</emph> (1785-1787), which document in detail the outfitting of the ship for a voyage from New York to Canton and back, along with payments to crew (portage bill), articles of association among its investors, and the eventual sale of the sloop and distribution of the proceeds. As another example, a folder includes the articles of association, stock certificates and other corporate documents concerning the Schuyler Steam Tow Boat Line and the Express Propeller Line (1847-1881). Although most ships are represented by only one or a few documents, these are often very rich documents, including an account of a British military expedition to the West Indies aboard the <emph render="italic">Boyne</emph> (1793-1794); signals to be used by the convoy of the <emph render="italic">Roman Emperor</emph> (1760s?); prize roll of the officers and seamen of the <emph render="italic">Constellation</emph> after the capture of the French frigate <emph render="italic">L'Insurgente</emph> (1799); logbook of the master of the <emph render="italic">Amphion</emph> on a voyage from New York to Montevideo (1820); the descriptive muster roll of the steamship <emph render="italic">General Grant</emph> (1864); morning reports of the prisoners in the brig of the <emph render="italic">St. Paul</emph> (1898); and orchestra programs and a captioned photograph of the band on the flagship <emph render="italic">Kentucky</emph> (1901-1904). Given the diverse nature of the materials in the collection, detailed scope notes are provided for each folder in the container list.</p>  </scopecontent>
