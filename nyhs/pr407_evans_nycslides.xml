<p>The collection includes about 107 color photographic slides, primarily of New York City. About 9 are of Bear Mountain State Park. The bulk are from 1957; 9 are from 1959. The images include views from the Empire State Building and from a Hudson River ferry, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Central Park, Chrysler Building, the United Nations, an Automat display, and the Battery, Wall Street, and other lower Manhattan locations.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The lists of slides included in the collection refer to various locales that are no longer in the boxes. Some of these refer to Asbury Park, New Jersey, indicating it was "home." That suggests that these images were taken by someone making occasional day trips to New York City. It is not known if the donor, Patricia Evans, was the photographer or someone she knew or was related to.</p>  </bioghist>
