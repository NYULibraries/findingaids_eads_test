The charitable organization was founded in New York City in 1853 to aid, educate, and provide lodging for poor children in the city, and/or to place them in foster homes or with employers outside of the city. The bulk of the records relate to the CAS lodging houses, industrial schools, convalescent homes, health centers, farm schools, and, especially, the emigration programs ("orphan train") and foster care and adoption programs which operated during the period 1853-1947. The collection also includes  material, such as minutes and financial data, from 1948-1970 and annual reports to 2006. Most records involving specific children require special permission to be viewed.

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p><title render="bold"> The Founding of the Children's Aid Society</title></p><p>The Children's Aid Society (CAS) was founded in February 1853 by a group of nine men including Protestant minister Charles Loring Brace. Brace was selected by the group to become the Secretary of the new organization. According to the first annual report, the founding was motivated by concern over the burden upon city resources caused by unprecedented numbers of immigrants, and over concern that impoverished immigrant children were turning to crime or barely surviving as homeless vagabonds selling matches or sweeping streets. The founders believed that gainful work, education, and a wholesome family atmosphere would transform New York's street children into self-reliant members of society. The organization raised substantial funds from the public and many wealthy philanthropists including members of the Roosevelt, Astor, and Dodge families, and immediately began opening lodging houses for homeless youths, as well as industrial schools to teach cobbling, sewing, and many other trades. They also initiated an emigration program, which they explicated in the first annual report: "We have thus far sent off to homes in the country, or to places where they could earn an honest living, 164 boys and 43 girls, of whom some 20 were taken from prison, where they had been placed for being homeless on the streets. The great majority were the children of poor or degraded people, who were leaving them to grow up neglected in the streets. They were found by our visitors at the turning point of their lives, and sent to friendly homes, where they would be removed from the overwhelming temptations which poverty and neglect certainly occasion in a great city. Of these 200 boys and girls, a great proportion are so many vagrants or criminals saved; so much expense lessened to courts and prisons; so much poisonous influence removed from the city; and so many boys and girls, worthy of something better from society than a felon's fate, placed where they can enter on manhood or womanhood somewhat as God intended that they should."</p><p><title render="bold">"The Orphan Train"</title></p><p>From 1853-1929 the Emigration Department, interchangeably known as the Placing-Out Department, and finally the Foster Home Department, sent tens of thousands of children to the country, placing them most often with farm families. With this program, the Children's Aid Society became one of the first and principal organizations orchestrating the mass migration of children now known as "the orphan train," and established itself as a pioneer in the development of foster care for children, as opposed to institutionalization in orphanages or almshouses. The CAS sent children all over the United States. At first, they sent children primarily to the Midwest and West, taking advantage of new train lines and the need for farm labor during the period of westward expansion. Children were also sent south, often to Delaware and Maryland. By the early 1920's, half of all children placed went north to upstate New York. "Orphan train riders" ranged in age from infants to older teenagers. Some were foster children; the families agreed to treat them like members of the family and send them to school, and in return expected the children to help on the farm or in the house. Other children were formally adopted. Still others (usually older boys) were sent as paid laborers. The Children's Aid Society followed up on all children they placed. The children and/or their foster families were expected to write regularly to the CAS. In addition, field agents made regular visits to homes where children had been placed, and wrote reports after each visit. Children were frequently removed from homes and transferred to other homes when the situation was not harmonious.</p><p>Although the emigration program became known as the "orphan train," many of the children were not orphans. They were children whose guardians could not care for them, or who hoped they would find a better life, and who signed surrender documents releasing them to the care of the Children's Aid Society. Many others were adolescents without known guardians who were seeking their own fortunes by heading west. Some children came via CAS lodging houses or schools, or were recruited by CAS agents. Many other children were transferred to the care of the Children's Aid Society from orphanages, almshouses and correctional facilities all over New York City and State. For older boys, the CAS operated a farm school (Brace Farm opened in 1894 in Valhalla N.Y. and was superseded by a more substantial program at Bowdoin Farm in New Hamburg N.Y. in 1929) to train boys in farm work and give them a taste of what to expect, before sending them to farms. By 1929 the emigration program in its original form had ended, and the only children sent to farms in the country were older boys placed as paid laborers after training at Bowdoin Farm. A smaller training program at Goodhue Home on Staten Island prepared girls for foster care and adoption placement, beginning around 1921.</p><p>The Children's Aid Society also operated a "Family Emigration Program" through which they provided train tickets for entire families to rejoin a breadwinner who had found work in another state, for example, or paid a portion of the fare to return to Europe. The CAS had occasionally provided help for entire families from its earliest days, but the records of the Family Emigration Program date from 1874-1926.</p><p><title render="bold">Schools, Lodging Houses, Convalescent Homes, and Other Programs</title></p><p>The Society did not confine itself to sending children or families away from the city. The CAS also devoted significant resources to helping children in the urban environment. In New York City, the well-endowed society rented spaces and hired world-class architects to build an impressive number of facilities to their specifications. Most notably, the architectural and engineering firm of Vaux Radford built at least a dozen buildings for the Children's Aid Society. The CAS operated lodging houses, a shelter for mothers with children, industrial schools to teach trades, nursery schools, boys' and girls' clubs and children's centers, and playgrounds. It operated nutrition programs, dental programs, and medical programs. In the country (Westchester, Staten Island and Coney Island), the Children's Aid Society operated convalescent homes, a seaside retreat, summer camps, summer excursion programs, and the farm schools. When a neighborhood no longer needed CAS services, the society closed its facilities there and moved to where the demographics indicated a greater need.</p><p><title render="bold">Evolution of the Children's Aid Society</title></p><p>The mission of the Children's Aid Society changed as the needs of New York City children changed and as the CAS developed new ideas about how best to serve them. During the 1920's the "orphan train" in its original form slowed to a halt, but the problem of homeless and jobless boys remained urgent, especially during the Great Depression, and boys continued to be placed out as laborers on farms throughout the 1930s. A new emphasis on helping children stay with their families supplanted the goal of transporting children away from the city, but the CAS continued to provide foster care and adoption services for children when staying with their families was not an option. A Foster Home and Temporary Boarding Home Department was initiated in 1924, and it phased out the Emigration/Placing-Out Department by 1929. The Children's Aid Society closed the last of its industrial schools in 1927, leaving education to the public and parochial school systems, and re-fashioned the schools as health centers, boys' and girls' clubs, and community centers. In the 1920's and 1930's the CAS also began to devote a larger percentage of its resources to African American children.</p><p>Today the society serves over 150,000 children and other clients annually, at 45 sites in New York City. Their services begin before birth, with prenatal counseling and assistance, and continue through high school, with college and job preparatory training programs, health care, academic, sports, and arts programs, community schools, and an adolescent sexuality and pregnancy prevention program. To stabilize families, CAS also provides services to parents including housing assistance, domestic violence counseling, and health care access. The CAS "concurrent planning" approach to foster care became the basis for the 1996 federal Adoption and Safe Families Act, which defines today's modern foster care system.</p><p>For more detailed historical notes about Children's Aid Society officers, facilities and programs, please see notes in Series IV, IX, X, XI, and XII. </p>    <chronlist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of the historical records of the Children's Aid Society (CAS). The charitable organization was founded in New York City in 1853 to aid, educate, and provide lodging for poor children in the city, and/or to place them in foster homes or with employers outside of the city. The records relate to the CAS lodging houses, industrial schools, convalescent homes, health centers, farm schools, and, especially, the emigration programs ("orphan train") which operated during the period 1853-1947. The collection also includes material such as minutes and financial reports from 1948-1970 and annual reports to 2006. A large portion of the collection consists of case files from the emigration program which are <title render="bold">restricted and need special permission to be viewed.</title>  Materials most represented in the collection are reports, bound volumes, photographs, and correspondence, among other material types. </p><p>The collection is arranged in 15 series, according to subject matter and/or type of material. It is contained in 994 archival boxes and two oversize boxes, as well as 807 bound volumes. Portions of the collection have been digitized and can be viewed on <extref xlink:href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/n-yhs/collections/72157623964464144/">flickr</extref>.</p><p><title render="bold">"Orphan Train" and Farm School Records: </title> 
The records of the CAS programs which placed children in homes outside of the city constitute the bulk of the collection. These records may be found in Series XI, box numbers 45-971 and volumes 362-473. <title render="bold">Boxes 56-971 are restricted and need special permission to be viewed. Many of the volumes in this series are also restricted. Restricted volumes are noted in the container list.  </title>Boxes 45-971 include the case files and correspondence of foster or adopted children sent to the country, and of boys who had completed the CAS farm school program and who were then placed on farms for wages. (The case files for both paid and unpaid placements were kept together by the CAS). Non-restricted materials in this series include correspondence from children from before the CAS began keeping case files (boxes 45-55), a small number of broadsides, pamphlets, and reports, and some volumes. Other unrestricted material from the Emigration/Placing-Out program can be found in the photographs in Series XIII. The facilities series, Series IX, also has a significant percentage of records from the farm schools where boys were trained before they were placed in the country.</p><p><title render="bold">CAS Facilities Records: </title> 
Although the records of the placing-out programs constitute the bulk of the collection, the collection also includes a substantial amount of material produced by the lodging houses, medical department and convalescent homes run by the CAS, and a smaller amount of material on the industrial schools and camps operated by the society. Materials related to CAS facilities include narrative registers which tell the stories of people taken in by the CAS, statistical record books which provide precise intake numbers and data about those who passed through CAS facilities, and brochures and pamphlets produced by the facilities or programs. These materials support research on the lives and experiences of poor, immigrant, sick, or homeless children, and young men and women in the city from 1853-1930s.</p><p><title render="bold">Photographic Prints and Tintypes: </title> 
The collection includes a significant number of vintage photographs and tintypes. Photographic materials include 2 boxes of photographs of companies of children sent to the country together, 3 boxes of photographs of farm school boys, and 4 boxes of photographs documenting activities in CAS industrial schools, lodging houses, summer camps, and convalescent homes. The CAS hired photographers, including Lewis Hine, to take these photographs for annual reports, brochures and other CAS public relations purposes, between the years 1893-1930's (bulk 1911-1931). Hired photographers also made portraits of CAS officers and trustees, and portraits of children to represent the type of child the CAS helped. Additional portraits among the photographs include thousands of formal portraits and snapshots in the case files, and in 2 boxes of duplicate photographs removed from the case files.</p><p><title render="bold">Business and Organizational Records: </title> 
517 bound volumes and 13 boxes contain the business, financial and fund-raising records of the CAS. These materials include ledgers; correspondence accompanying donations; appeals, pamphlets, brochures and invitations sent to donors; and records related to donations and other income, and payroll and other expenditures. The materials support research into the business of running a major charitable organization from 1853-circa 1960.</p><p>The collection includes Minutes of the Board of Trustees from 1853 to 1970 (except for late 1963 through 1965, which are missing), Annual Reports from 1853 to 2006, and founding, organizational, and constitutional documents. It includes a relatively small and incomplete selection of executive correspondence, and small quantities of legal and real estate documents. It includes a strong number of reports and articles composed for the public, public addresses and radio speeches, as well as reports submitted to supervisory and other agencies, documenting the work of the CAS. The annual reports and other reports provide a window onto the way the CAS perceived and articulated its mission and communicated its accomplishments, and the ways the mission changed over time.</p><p><title render="bold">Other materials and Notable Materials: </title> 
The collection includes several diaries written by nineteenth century agents of the CAS documenting their encounters with poor children in New York City and the earliest days of the CAS's operation. There are also some memoirs and historical sketches by CAS employees relating their experiences in retrospect.</p><p>The collection includes photocopied newspaper clippings organized by year and by subject.</p><p>Unusual or notable items in the collection include broadsides and pamphlets from the "orphan train" emigration/placing out program (Series XI), architectual drawings by Calvert Vaux, who designed many Children's Aid Society buildings (Series VIII), diaries by agents of the CAS who found and visited needy children and intervened to help them (Series V), vintage photographic prints of groups ("companies") of children sent to the country together as part of the emigration/placing-out program (Series XIII.5), vintage photographic prints of Children's Aid Society programs and facilities (Series XIII.2-3), amateur minstrel show programs from the Newsboys' Lodging House (Series IX) along with other pamphlets and materials from Children's Aid Society lodging houses, industrial schools, farm schools and convalescent homes, and volumes describing the activities of those facilities in both narrative and statistical form (Series IX and X).</p>  </scopecontent>

<emph render="italic">Scope and Content</emph></p><p>The series as a whole consists of Annual Reports, and other published and unpublished reports, public addresses, and radio speeches on a wide range of topics, produced by the CAS for public audiences (subseries 1, 2), for supervisory agencies and other organizations (subseries 3), or for internal purposes (subseries 4). Subseries 5 and 6 include reports related to the work of the CAS but written by organizations and individuals writing outside the auspices of CAS. The reports span the years 1853-2006 (bulk 1853-1942). Because of the broad extent of dates and topics covered and audiences addressed, the series provides an overview of the shifting concerns of the CAS over the years. For further information about materials, please see the notes for each individual subseries. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref21_kkb" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries III.1 - Annual Reports</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1854-2006</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cf0e8b81c6ea59359cdd8f2770c4b328"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries consists of annual reports of the Children's Aid Society from 1854-2006.

as well as other types of articles and presentations composed for the public, or for smaller audiences. The materials range in form, from reports bound in larger booklets, to short reports in the form of informational pamphlets, to letters to the editor, to typescripts of papers, public addresses and radio speeches. Some of the material is in draft form. The materials in this subseries were created to inform the public (or particular smaller audiences) about social issues of concern to the Children's Aid Society, to promote the Children's Aid Society's solutions, and indirectly to encourage donations or other support. The subseries spans the years 1857-circa 1942. Arranged chronologically, this subseries provides a good overview of the shifting concerns of the CAS over the years.</p><p>See also the published works of Charles Loring Brace (Series IV, volumes 39-42) and the booklets and pamphlets in Series VI.3 (Fund-Raising Materials) for other reports composed for the public. See also Series VII for reports on legal matters, Series IX for reports on facilities, Series X for reports on medical programs, Series XI for reports on the Emigration and Foster Home Programs, and Series XII for reports on other programs.</p><p>Note: This subseries contains reports by two people named Charles Loring Brace. Founder Charles Loring Brace is identified by that name in this collection. His son, who followed him as Secretary of CAS in 1890 and went by the same name or by C. Loring Brace or Loring Brace or C.L. Brace, is identified as Charles Loring Brace II for the purposes of this collection. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref430_5dp" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Address Upon the Industrial School Movement, Delivered at a Union Meeting of the Ladies of the Industrial Schools," by Charles Loring Brace </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1857 November</unitdate><container id="aspace_f4010fe25fbcef82e84d33bbcfeb3e6b" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020892]" type="Offsite-Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_f4010fe25fbcef82e84d33bbcfeb3e6b" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref432_pzw" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The Best Method of Disposing of Our Pauper and Vagrant Children," by Charles Loring Brace</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1859/1859" type="inclusive">1859</unitdate><container id="aspace_52f956212eb8f33c8c223d15fa1a941d" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020892]" type="Offsite-Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_52f956212eb8f33c8c223d15fa1a941d" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref433_qwu" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The Cost of a Charity" Analysis of 1873 CAS expenses, justifying expenditures to potential donors, by Charles Loring Brace</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1874/1874" type="inclusive">1874</unitdate><container id="aspace_06e048bd4d30155d9e4c9bdaca448490" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020892]" type="Offsite-Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_06e048bd4d30155d9e4c9bdaca448490" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref434_pq5" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Some Reasons Why," a report in defense of public funding of CAS Industrial Schools, author unknown, typescript</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1875-1925</unitdate><container id="aspace_af2c3892b662d739fce1096f1b952849" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020892]" type="Offsite-Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_af2c3892b662d739fce1096f1b952849" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref435_xw2" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Summer Charities of the Children's Aid Society," by G.

Many of the albums also record information about each fundraising effort, including target audience, number of mailings, response rates and revenue raised, and other information. Year to year comparisons are also present in some cases.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_cbdadeecb54844175b5ef138ef2ed697"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The sub-subseries is arranged chronologically.</p><p>Note on fragility and condition of the material: Although the individual fundraising documents themselves are in good condition, the albums are deteriorated. The page backings are crumbling and the glue that originally held many of the documents to the backing has loosened, especially for the albums of the 1950s-1970s. Consequently, many documents lie loose in the albums and so must be handled and pages turned with great care. For earlier albums, various fasteners were used to hold the documents in place; most of these were left in the album during processing. To the extent these impede the use of individual documents, patrons should bring that to the attention of the reference librarian who will call for assistance to remove fasteners as needed.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_2e97350b18feccb4d2b30fa23f22a993"><head>Processing Information</head><p>The documents in this sub-subseries were added to the finding aid in April 2019 by archivist Larry Weimer.

Contents</head><p>Series IX contains documents produced by and regarding CAS facilities, including industrial schools, lodging houses, camps, and farm schools. The materials are divided into 2 subseries:</p><p>IX.1 Facilities - Mixed</p><p>IX.2 Facilities - Arranged Alphabetically</p><p>The documents in subseries 1 are arranged chronologically. The documents in subseries 2 are arranged alphabetically by facility, and then chronologically for each facility. For convalescent facilities, please see Series X - Convalescent Facilities and Medical Programs.</p><p>Series IX includes both volumes and material in boxes, interfiled. Some volumes provide statistical data; others provide narrative material (stories about individuals who passed through the facilities). Volumes with narrative material are noted in the container list.  </p><p>Material types in the boxes include pamphlets, invitations, press releases, reports, memos, correspondence, forms, disbound volumes, property surveys, an address book and bank passbooks, newsletters, programs for minstrel shows and other entertainments and events, and some photos and minutes.</p><p>Bowdoin Farm and the Newsboys Lodging House are particularly well represented in the boxed materials. The Girls Lodging House, Elizabeth Home, Eleventh Ward Lodging House, Tompkins Square Lodging House, and Emergency Shelter for Women and Children are particularly well-represented among the volumes. There are fewer records from the industrial schools. Some materials from Bowdoin Camp, Bowdoin Farm, Brace Farm, and the convalescent homes are housed in a separate oversized (OS) box, noted in the container list.</p><p>Note: Children's Aid Society facilities changed names and locations frequently, and were sometimes known by different names at the same time. For a history of name changes, and how they relate to arrangement, see the note for Subseries IX.2 - Facilities, Alphabetical.</p><p><emph render="italic">Related Material in Other Series:</emph></p><p>Photographs of facilities are in Series XIII - Photographs. Volumes and other material related to the finances of a particular facility are included here in Series IX, but capital fund-raising campaigns for facilities are in Series VI.1 - Fund Raising - because such campaigns originated from the CAS main office, not at the facility itself.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref57_db4" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries IX.1 - Facilities, Mixed</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1882/1937" type="inclusive">1882-1937</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6cf5a1547efbb8cb8a1ea5f1e815c71a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries consists of 1 box of records 1882-1937, and 9 volumes 1900-1909, documenting CAS facilities arranged as a group.

The facilities represented include industrial schools, lodging houses, summer camps and farm schools. Convalescent facilities follow in Series X - Convalescent Facilities and Medical Programs.</p><p>Some volumes provide statistical data; others provide narrative material (stories about individuals who passed through the facilities). When a volume includes narrative material it is noted in the container list. Some volumes contained interleaved papers; such loose materials have been kept in envelopes with the volume. The boxed materials and volumes are interfiled chronologically by the facility that produced them.</p><p>Material types in the boxes include pamphlets, invitations, press releases, reports, memos, correspondence, forms, disbound volumes, property surveys, an address book and bank passbooks, newsletters, programs for minstrel shows and other entertainments and events, and some photos and minutes.</p><p>Bowdoin Farm School and the Newsboys' Lodging House are particularly well represented in the boxed materials. The materials from Bowdoin Farm School extend late enough to include alumni reunion materials, and materials related to the end of its existence as a CAS program in 1958, as well as a property survey from 1974. See also Series XII - photographs - for a large amount of material related to Bowdoin Farm School. The Newsboys' Lodging House materials include programs for amateur minstrel shows and other entertainments and events. Both Bowdoin Farm School and the Newsboys' Lodging House materials include newsletters. Some materials from Bowdoin Camp, Bowdoin Farm, Brace Farm, and the convalescent homes are housed in a separate oversized (OS) box, noted in the container list.</p><p>The Girls Lodging House, Elizabeth Home, Eleventh Ward Lodging House, Tompkins Square Lodging House, and Emergency Shelter for Women and Children are particularly well-represented among the volumes. There are fewer records from the industrial schools.</p><p><emph render="bold">Name and Location Changes at CAS Facilities</emph></p><p>Children's Aid Society facilities changed names and locations frequently, and were sometimes known by different names simultaneously. An attempt has been made to arrange facilities by the names by which they seemed most commonly known, with other names noted. The following are specific notes regarding names and arrangement:</p><p>Bowdoin Camp is arranged separately and alphabetically before Bowdoin Farm School. The two programs shared the same grounds, but performed different functions. Bowdoin Farm replaced Brace Farm as the CAS farm training program in 1929. After that time, Brace Farm changed its mission to focus on children with special needs, but did not change its name. Some material on Brace Farm School can be found among the material on the Newsboys Lodging House, as the programs served the same population, and boys often attended both facilities.</p><p>The Emergency Shelter for Women and Children is listed by that name. In practice, sometimes the word Emergency was not used, at other times the name specified "evicted women and children," and when it first opened in 1901 at 311 East 12th Street, next to the Elizabeth Home at 307-9 East 12th Street, it was also called the Elizabeth Home Annex.</p><p>The Girl's Lodging House (which operated on 205 New Canal Street from 1862-1872 and at 27 St. Mark's Place from 1872-1892) was replaced by the Elizabeth Home and Training School for Girls (1892-1930) at the new location at 307-9 East 12th Street. Thirty-eight girls, and the facility's record books, moved from one building into the new one. The first two Girls Lodging Houses are arranged consecutively, but the Elizabeth Home is arranged separately under its own name (it was also known as the Elizabeth Wheeler Home in its final years). Researchers should be aware that the collection contains three record books initiated at the Girls Lodging House and arranged under the Girls Lodging House, which also contain early Elizabeth Home records.</p><p>Similarly, the Eleventh Ward Lodging House (709 East 11th Street) was replaced by the Tompkins Square Lodging House (295 East 8th Street). Since they were in different locations with different names, they are arranged separately, although the function and clients of one were transferred to the other. The Newsboys Lodging House volume 329 may have come from the Eleventh Ward Lodging House, but is arranged under Newsboys according to its title.</p><p>All Newsboys' Lodging House materials are arranged under that name, although the facility was re-christened Brace Memorial Newsboys' Lodging House in 1891 after the death of Charles Loring Brace. It was also known as Brace Memorial Newsboys' Home. The Newsboys' Lodging House moved through several locations, from Fulton Street, to Park Place, to Duane Street, to New Chambers Street, and then Williams Street. In all locations, it housed boys who worked in any occupation, not just newsboys.</p><p>The Mott Street Industrial School is arranged under that name, although it was also known as the 14th Ward Industrial School and the Astor Memorial School.</p><p>The Sixth Street Industrial School is listed by that name, although it was renamed the Sloane Children's Center in 1945, beyond the bulk dates of this collection. Similarly, the Sullivan Street Industrial School (219 Sullivan St) is listed under that name, although it was later known as the Lower West Side Children's Center, and then the Greenwich Village Children's Center. It is not to be confused with the West Side Italian School, which was also on Sullivan Street, at number 24. The West Side Italian School is not to be confused with the Italian School, which was at 44 Franklin Street, then 156 Leonard Street (1880's-1908), then at 155 Worth Street (1909-1912) and finally at Elizabeth and Hester Streets (later known as the James Children's Center) beginning in 1913.</p><p>The West Side Lodging House on West 32nd Street (until 1902) and then West 35th Street, was also known as the West Side Boys' Home. The facility closed as a lodging house in 1917 and became the Wendell Boys' Club, with a different mission. The Wendell Boys' Club is arranged separately from the West Side Lodging House. The building was sold in 1921. The West Side Health School was a different facility altogether, on West 38th Street.</p><p>Finally, the main office of the CAS in its earliest days did not have a facility name, but in addition to functioning as an administrative office, it performed intake work. The narrative record books from that facility, located on Astor Place, are listed first among the facilities. Unidentified facilities are listed last.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref991_t1y" level="file"><did><unittitle>[Administrative and Intake Office of the CAS] Record Book No. 1, Narrative Daily

include volumes interfiled with boxes. The boxed materials in both subseries include correspondence, reports, referral cards, and pamphlets. Two folders have been separated to an oversized (OS) box, noted in the container list.</p><p><emph render="bold">History of CAS Medical Programs</emph></p><p>The Children's Aid Society began its Sick Children's Mission in 1873. In this program, CAS physicians, nurses, and "visitors" called on poor, sick children in their tenement homes, dispensed medicine and food, instructed mothers on nutrition and other matters, and referred children to CAS convalescent facilities outside the city. The series includes reports by these visitors, and some referral and physician's recommendation cards. It also includes reports, pamphlets, volumes, and correspondence related to the convalescent facilities of the CAS to which children were referred.</p><p>The Summer Home at Bath Beach Long Island was built in 1882, and served sick and disabled ("crippled") children. The Health Home at Coney Island was founded in 1884 and served poor mothers with children under six years old. The Elizabeth Milbank Anderson Home in Chappaqua, NY began operation in 1909 (originally called the Chappaqua Convalescent Home), and enabled the Sick Children's Mission to operate throughout the year, not just as a summer charity. Kinderfold in New Hamburg NY was a small program founded in 1915 for convalescing boys over 12. The Goodhue Home in Staten Island for girls was also used in part as a girls' Kinderfold facility from 1919. The Sick Children's Mission also organized day trips taking children out of the city, such as the Astor Day Excursions funded by Mr. and Mrs. Vincent Astor beginning in 1913 and operating through the 1930s, and the Rockefeller Excursions.</p><p>In 1920 the Sick Children's Mission was renamed the Medical Bureau, and then renamed the Medical Department in 1929. Dr. Charles Conklin became Superintendent of the Sick Children's Mission beginning in 1907 and retired as Director of the Medical Department in 1940. Although the leadership remained constant and the convalescent homes and day excursions continued as before, the name change represented a shift toward a more centralized and coordinated healthcare mission extended throughout CAS facilities. In 1924 Conklin instituted a campaign against malnutrition in CAS facilities, the same year that CAS industrial schools were rechristened health schools. The same year, a convalescent home for boys 8-16 was established in Valhalla, NY, soon known as the Milbank and Martha Homes, and the Elizabeth Milbank Anderson Home in Chappaqua was re-purposed for girls and boys under 8.

This arrangement follows the CAS' own arrangment -- the CAS kept adoption, foster care, and employment case files together. The names of CAS placement programs changed over time, but the Children's Aid Society kept the records continuously through name changes, using the consecutive record books and case files collected in this series.</p><p>The series is subdivided into 6 subseries. <emph render="bold">Most of the material in subseries 3-5 is restricted.</emph></p><p>Subseries XI.1 - Broadsides, Pamphlets, Reports, and Other Materials circa 1867-circa 1994 consists of one box of Emigration, Placing-Out, and Foster Care materials arranged chronologically.</p><p>Subseries XI.2 - Correspondence from Children and Foster Families, Chronological, 1855-1914 (bulk 1861-1881)consists of 10 boxes of correspondence, arranged chronologically. This subseries is open for researchers. There is a 13 year gap between the bulk of the final material in the subseries and the first material of the following subseries.</p><p>Subseries XI.3 - Case Files 1895-1951 (bulk 1895-1939) consists of circa 15,000 case files in 913 boxes. This subseries is the largest part of the CAS collection. The case files are comprised of foster care and adoption records, and perhaps an equal number of records of employment placements -- records of boys who trained at the Farm School and were subsequently placed in farm homes for wages. The case files include forms, reports on frequent CAS follow-up visits, photographs, and correspondence from the placed-out children, their host families, and occasionally their biological families. Many children kept up correspondence with agents of the CAS well into adulthood. <emph render="bold">The names of individual children have not been included in this finding aid, because the information is restricted.</emph></p><p>Subseries XI.4 - Bound Volumes consists of 100 bound volumes of records of the Emigration and Placing-Out Program (1853-1916). These volumes include Surrender Volumes, in which guardians surrender their charges to the care of the Children's Aid Society; Record Books, which describe individual cases; Company Books, listing groups that traveled together; and other volumes</p><p>Subseries XI.5 contains disbound ring binders and lists created by the Foster Home Department, 1917-1939 (bulk 1929-1939).</p><p>Subseries XI.6 consists of non-CAS publications related to the "Orphan Train," including self-published books by orphan train riders.</p><p><emph render="bold">History of CAS Emigration Programs, including "Family Emigration," Employment, Adoption, and Foster Care</emph></p><p>The mission of sending children to the country was the driving force of the Children's Aid Society from its founding in 1853. Twenty-five years later, in the 26th annual report from 1878, the society continued to affirm that "the most important part of our work is the transference of poor and homeless children to good country homes." The primacy of that mission continued throughout the period covered by this collection. The Emigration Department sent thousands of children to foster care and(for older children)employment situations in the country. In some cases, children were formally adopted by families, or families later chose to adopt them, but in most cases children were placed less formally.</p><p>The CAS called the program Emigration in its annual reports beginning circa 1859, and it was known as the Emigration and/or Placing-Out Department until 1899. From 1899-1925 it was known in the annual reports as the "Western Emigration and Placing-Out Department," although the CAS continued to use forms which called it alternately the Emigration or Placing-Out Department.</p><p>It is well known that the CAS separated children from their families to start anew. It is less widely known that the CAS also provided train tickets for entire families to leave the city together, to rejoin a breadwinner or pursue other opportunities. Beginning in 1874, the CAS initiated an explicit "family emigration" program which signalled a shift toward a goal of keeping families together. Beginning around 1898 the department's stated purpose in the annual reports included not only "finding homes for homeless chldren" but also "assisting poor families to reach distant friends for employment." Families traveled on the same trains as companies of children and are included in the "Company Books" and the "Record Books" in subseries XI.4. However, families were never included in the case files of the Emigration Department; the CAS did not provide additional social work care for them or track their progress. Although some information about families is contained in Emigration Department Record Books, other records of Family Emigration were kept separate, in volumes that are arranged in the following series of this collection, as Series XII.2.</p><p>Beginning around 1923 a Family Home Department was initiated, to put children in temporary suburban homes with the goal of eventually returning them to their families. In 1926 this Family Home Department became known as the Boarding Home Department, and the Western Emigration and Placing-Out Department became known as the Home-Finding or Placing-Out Department, and sometimes the Free Home and Adoption Department. In 1931 these two programs, the Home-Finding Department and the Boarding Home Department, were consolidated as the Department of Foster Home Care, aka the Foster Home Department. The Foster Home Department had two divisions: the Free Home Division, for older boys, adolescent girls, and troubled youths, and the Boarding Division, for younger children. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref61_qsw" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries X1.1 - Broadsides, Pamphlets, Reports, and other Materials</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1867- circa 1994</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9fa5e7c5fd6811788cd7cae35651d18b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The subseries consists of one box of Emigration, Placing-Out, and Foster Care materials arranged chronologically circa 1867-circa 1994, and 1 folder housed in a separate oversized (OS) box, noted in the container list.

Children's Aid Society from children who were placed out in the country, and from the foster families who cared for them. The material is arranged chronologically, grouped by month, from 1855-1914 (bulk 1861-1881). Box 53A contains a volume of 1877 correspondence discovered and processed after the rest of the CAS collection was processed, creating a slight break in chronological order. That box also contains 1 tintype, which is the only photographic material in this subseries. There is only one folder of material 1884-1886 and one folder 1900-1914.</p><p>The letters, originally glued or posted into scrapbook-style volumes, were in poor condition at the time of the donation of the collection. The scrapbook volumes, most of which were missing covers, have since been disbound, and the letters treated to remove glue and dirt. Index pages and pages with lists of children are included in the subseries, if such pages were extant.</p><p>Each piece of correspondence was marked by the CAS recipient with a cross-reference to the volume and page number of the record book in which the child's records were kept. Those record books are arranged in Series XI.4.</p><p>The correspondence in this subseries includes a few letters from former CAS wards writing as soldiers in the Civil War. There is a 13 year gap between the bulk of the final material in this subseries and the earliest material of the following subseries, XI.3, which also contains correspondence from children and foster families. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1534_doa" level="file"><did><unittitle>Emigration/Placing-Out Program, Correspondence Received</unittitle><unitdate

Most case files include application forms from prospective foster families or employers, reports of visits or updates on the children by CAS agents, correspondence to the Children's Aid Society from children who were placed out in the country, and/or from the foster families or employers who cared for them. There are also many photographs.</p><p>The material is housed in boxes 56-964, and the files are arranged by case file number. The numbers were assigned roughly chronologically around the time the child came under the care of the CAS. These case files cover children placed between 1895-1951 (bulk 1895-1939). There is material in the case files from later dates, if correspondence or other contact occurred in subsequent decades. Boxes 56-688, containing case files numbered 1-10,347, from 1895-1916, are cross-referenced to the volumes in subseries XI.4. Boxes 965-968 contain miscellaneous case files 1895-1930, numbered 15,000-15,353 and unnumbered. All numbers above 15,000 were assigned by Victor Remer in the 1980's. Boxes 968-969 contain case files grouped alphabetically from the 1920's-1940's.</p><p>This finding aid does not list the individual folders in boxes 56-969, because <emph render="bold">the case files are RESTRICTED and the names in the records are sealed.</emph> The N-YHS reference department maintains a list of all photographs, tintypes, and selected visual materials in the case files. Please contact the reference department for further information about access to case file materials. Researchers whose primary interest is tracing family history will be put in contact with a designated Children's Aid Society specialist who will interview the potential researcher to determine what he or she may consult and will then supervise the reader's use of the appropriate material. Guidelines currently in place for family history research at CAS, as determined by legal restrictions on the accessibility of adoption and foster care records, will be followed. See Access Restrictions, at the top of this finding aid. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1795_152" level="file"><did><unittitle>Emigration/Placing-Out and Foster Home Programs, Case Files 1-14,141</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1895-1951</unitdate><container id="aspace_dc63a9f00758b83db700b530ef3b87a0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box"> 56-964 </container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1796_5gh" level="file"><did><unittitle>Emigration/Placing-Out and Foster Home Programs, Case Files 15,000-15,353 and unnumbered</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1895-1930</unitdate><container id="aspace_0445f02f6f9c76b6216eb4eae9227e6b" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box"> 965-968</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1797_i2b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Emigration/Placing-Out and Foster Home Programs, Case Files - Alphabetical</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1920's-1940's</unitdate><container id="aspace_cd5c013b7748a1d41d26fd7d4d8251d2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">968-969</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref64_u7v" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries X1.4 - Emigration/Placing-Out Program, Bound Volumes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1853/1930" type="inclusive">1853-1930</unitdate><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1853/1916" type="bulk">1853-1916</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b034642a5995f4a4cb1820ed3bb74bfd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries consists of 100 bound volumes related to children placed in homes or work situations by the Emigration/Placing-Out Program of the Children's Aid Society, 1853-1930 (bulk 1853-1916).

In format, there is usually one page per child, with notes beginning at the time the child came under the care of the CAS, and with updates recorded over the years, until contact ended. Record Book 1 is out of chronological order, and is a concordance with Record Books 33-39 covering 1898-1904, and Record Book 2 is blank. Thus, Record Book 3 is the earliest. The volumes overlap chronologically, and in terms of some information, with the volumes in the previous subseries, XI.4.A. The correspondence and case files in Series XI.2 and XI.3 are cross-referenced to the Record Books in this sub-subseries.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1841_9lm" level="file"><did><unittitle>Index -

Families traveled on the same trains as companies of children and are included in the "Company Books" and the "Record Books" in subseries XI.4. However, families were never included in the case files of the Emigration Department; the CAS did not provide additional social work care for them or track their progress.

Originally called the Negro Child Placing Bureau, the program aimed to place about 300 Negro children in Negro foster homes or institutions within three years, after which time the program would be evaluated and, if successful, extended. The Children's Aid Society agreed to administer the program. Dorothy Straus was the Chairman of the Board of the Advisory Committee, and Helen Cole of the CAS supervised the program. By 1939, a combination of public and private funds were procured. In three years, the Service Bureau placed 354 children in foster homes. The project was discontinued at the end of 1942. The project was notable in that it drew upon public subsidies for foster care, which had previously been paid for exclusively by private funding.</p><p>The subseries consists of 8 folders of Minutes and By-Laws, arranged chronologically 1936-1942, followed by 9 folders of correspondence, memos, and reports, arranged chronologically 1938-1945.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1661_j95" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes of the Sub-Committee on the Development of Additional Social Work Facilities for Negroes, and on the Colored Boarding Out Project</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1936 November 30 and 1937 June 16</unitdate><container id="aspace_55563126c82bb15f5b7948cc4ef3a352" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_55563126c82bb15f5b7948cc4ef3a352" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1662_0qr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes of the Negro Child Placing Bureau (7 meetings)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1937 October 1-1938 January 6</unitdate><container id="aspace_275dce1ffcea83e169115acd1ecce5c6" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_275dce1ffcea83e169115acd1ecce5c6" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1663_mji" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes of the Service Bureau for Negro Children (6 meetings)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1938 February 14-1938 December 23</unitdate><container id="aspace_5e7e6b651068921c5821b11fb431750e" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_5e7e6b651068921c5821b11fb431750e" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1664_ifa" level="file"><did><unittitle>By-Laws of the Service Bureau for Negro Children</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1938 October</unitdate><container id="aspace_7318993e7a16ff61e04234f84c754097" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_7318993e7a16ff61e04234f84c754097" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1665_j2b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes of the Service Bureau for Negro Children (6 meetings)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1939 March 21-1939 December 5</unitdate><container id="aspace_eb8e98abea363502aa58f922b54cef2a" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_eb8e98abea363502aa58f922b54cef2a" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1666_cr8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes of the Service Bureau for Negro Children including Committee and Staff Meeting Minutes (13 meetings)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1940 January 2-1940 December 30</unitdate><container id="aspace_786d47f6c01191a5c1739b159c4c4c79" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_786d47f6c01191a5c1739b159c4c4c79" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1667_cm3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Service Bureau for Negro Children -

Eleanor Roosevelt was the Honorary President, Marshall Field was President, and Agnes King Inglis was Secretary of the organizataion. The Children's Aid Society was one agency authorized to investigate potential foster homes and provide follow-up supervision of the children placed in these homes. The Children's Aid Society was wary of the project. CAS Executive Director Arthur Huck believed the children would be better off in Europe and CAS President William Church Osborn noted that international transfer of children was a serious business. Ultimately, rather than sending the children to foster care, a group of British children was housed in the former home of Charles E. Mitchell in Tuxedo New York, under the care of Mrs. H.C. Sonne whose husband bought the house and provided funding to sustain the children. Contributions for what became known as The Children's House were sent to CAS and processed through CAS accounts. CAS then paid bills and salaries to support the endeavor.</p><p>The subseries consists of 5 folders of correspondence and memos, arranged chronologically, followed by 1 folder of press clippings.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1678_jod" level="file"><did><unittitle>U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children - Correspondence, Pamphlet</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1940 June 6 - 1940 October 15</unitdate><container id="aspace_367452220eb4293f73c57eb1f5fe7da8" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_367452220eb4293f73c57eb1f5fe7da8" type="Folder">18</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1679_bah" level="file"><did><unittitle>U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children - Case of Pat Boucher - Correspondence, Memos</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1940 July - 1942 May 14</unitdate><container id="aspace_8df5bfe373822df33c16b508981689ec" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_8df5bfe373822df33c16b508981689ec" type="Folder">19</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1680_qe2" level="file"><did><unittitle>U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children - Case of Priscilla Clark - Correspondence, Memos</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1942 January 28-June 2</unitdate><container id="aspace_cab09b63649d757b3fdb20cb316d99c0" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_cab09b63649d757b3fdb20cb316d99c0" type="Folder">20</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1681_c8e" level="file"><did><unittitle>U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children - Correspondence [from the files of Arthur Huck]</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1942 August 12-September 11</unitdate><container id="aspace_34898049287e617fc51711d74c30bb11" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_34898049287e617fc51711d74c30bb11" type="Folder">21</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1682_1hu" level="file"><did><unittitle>U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children - Correspondence [from the files of Arthur Huck]</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1944 October 4-1945 July 11</unitdate><container id="aspace_9878698551920d399d81f843a1d6ac5a" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_9878698551920d399d81f843a1d6ac5a" type="Folder">22</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1683_7d7" level="file"><did><unittitle>U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children - Press</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1940-1947</unitdate><container id="aspace_1fce9e0fce78410b84afd5a6847b56b5" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022053]" type="Offsite-Box">973</container><container parent="aspace_1fce9e0fce78410b84afd5a6847b56b5" type="Folder">23</container></did></c></c></c><c id="aspace_ref13_zkp" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series XIII - Photographs</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1890-circa 1960</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_21f8722c93756a7e1d3d44c64b5ce15f"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series consists primarily of photographs, along with a few photomechanical reproductions clipped from books or annual reports. The series is divided into 6 subseries, as follows:</p><p>XIII.1 - Officers, Administrators and Trustees, circa 1895-circa early 1960s</p><p>XIII.2 - City Facilities: Lodging Houses, Industrial Schools, Children's Clubs, Programs and Services, and Special Events, circa 1904-circa 1955 (bulk 1908-1945)</p><p>XIII.3 - Country Facilities: Farm Schools, Camps and Convalescent Facilities, circa 1908-1945</p><p>XIII.4 - Children, Streets and Tenements, circa 1908-1932</p><p>XIII.5 - The Emigration/Placing-Out Program: Company Photographs, Duplicates of Photographs in Case Files, and Photos of Unidentified Children, 1890-circa 1920s</p><p>XIII.6 - Other Albums and Photographs, circa 1900-circa 1944</p><p>Subseries 1-3 are arranged alphabetically by individual or facility, and then in many cases further subdivided by photographer, then arranged numerically by photograph number. Subseries 4 is arranged chronologically by photographer. Subseries 5 is arranged chronologically. Subseries 6 is arranged by material type.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_115ec8cf59394f47e50f524b7818e4e5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Subseries 1-5 contain prints and tintypes. Most prints are vintage, but there are some reprints. Most prints are unbound and individual, but there is also one photo album in subseries XIII.2, and one photo album and one set of disbound photo albums in subseries XIII.3.</p><p>Subseries 6 includes 4 other photo albums with more wide-ranging subject matter. These include an album of Lewis Hine photographs of various CAS facilities and programs(individual prints of the same photographs and others by Lewis Hine are also arranged by facility in Subseries 2-4), and an interesting photo-essay about the CAS, composed ca. 1939 and 1944, consisting of a typed narrative about CAS programs and history illustrated by small sharp photographs attached by photocorners. See the subseries description for more information about this item and the other 2 photo albums in the subseries. Subseries 6 also includes oversize photographs and photographs that were neither commissioned by the CAS nor depicting the CAS, but which were kept by the CAS.</p><p>The Emigration Department company photographs (group portraits of children who traveled together) and other photographs in Subseries XIII.5 include the earliest photographs in the collection. This subseries contains prints and tintypes ca. 1890-1930's. In addition to these photographs, a complete list of Emigration Department case files containing thousands more prints, tintypes and postcards 1890's-1980's may be obtained from the reference department of the library at the New-York Historical Society. The photographers are unknown for all of the company photographs and most of the case file photographs. However, almost every tintype in the collection was taken by a single photographer named O'Connor, who worked from his studio on Eighth Avenue between 24th and 25th Streets. The tintypes most often depict adolescent boys and young men before they traveled to the country. Most of the tinytpes are individual portraits, some are group portraits of two or three boys, and a few tintypes include Trustee Evert Jansen Wendell with the boy.</p><p>Most of the photographs in the other subseries date from the 1910's through the early 1930's. These photographs were taken for public relations purposes, by photographers hired by the Children's Aid Society. The principal photographers represented in the collection are Underwood &amp; Underwood (ca. 1908-1913), Brown &amp; Dawson (a.k.a. Publisher's Photo Service) (ca. 1913-1926), A. Tennyson Beals (ca. 1915-1927), Hiram Myers (ca. 1923-1926), Paul Parker (ca. 1926-1932), and Lewis Hine (1928).</p><p>Most dates are approximate. Most photographs in this collection were never reprinted in documents in this collection, and those images that were reproduced in annual reports or other publications were often reproduced many years after the photographs were taken, making dating difficult. Conversely, most early photomechanical reproductions in the annual reports have no corresponding print in this collection; the originals have been lost. In addition, it is sometimes difficult to know with certainty which facility is depicted in a photograph. Every effort has been made to accurately identify facilities and ascertain approximate dates, based on cross-referencing photographs in CAS publications, using identification numbers and visual clues on the photographs, and mining the institutional memory of the CAS as researched by Victor Remer and the processing archivist, but misidentifications remain possible.</p></scopecontent><accessrestrict id="aspace_2bd32ccbe10023ce898ea7515c25ff8b"><head>To enlarge images:</head><p>Many of the folders include a thumbnail of the described photograph(s).

The photographs include a nearly complete set of 5x7 proofs numbered 1-84. Three numbers (45, 67, 79) are not represented, three additional numbers (5A, 31A, and 71A) are included, and there are a few duplicate proofs as well. The sub-subseries also includes 8x10 prints of many of these images. The images include many unpopulated landscapes, as well as images with people (especially farm school boys). The photographs were taken at a transitional time for the CAS, as the newly acquired Bowdoin Farm property in New Hamburg N.Y. was about to become a camp and farm school, replacing the Brace Farm School.</p><p>XIII.3.B - Photographs of Farm Schools - contains photographs of the CAS farm training programs arranged chronologically with Brace Farm School first, followed by Bowdoin Farm School, and then unidentified Brace and/or Bowdoin Farm School. Within these divisions, folders are further subdivided by photographer, and arranged numerically by photograph number within the folders. The sub-subseries concludes with a set of 8 small format disbound photo albums entitled "Bowdoin Farm Boys" from 1935-1943, consisting of 549 2.75 x 4.5 portraits of young men who attended the farm school.</p><p>XIII.3.C - Photographs of Camps - contains photographs of camp facilities, arranged alphabetically, and further subdivided chronologically. The Bowdoin Camp photographs include a bound photo album.</p><p>XIII.3.D - Photographs of Convalescent Facilities - contains photographs of CAS convalescent facilities, arranged alphabetically by facility.</p><p>Researchers should note that two of the same facilities used for camps were also used for farm schools, and Goodhue camp was also used as a home for girls preparing to go to foster care. Thus, there is some overlap between the sub-subseries. Lewis Hines' photographs of mixed country facilities are arranged as sub-subseries A.

The photographs include a nearly complete set of 5x7 proofs numbered 1-84. Three numbers (45, 67, 79) are not represented, three additional numbers (5A, 31A, and 71A) are included, and there are a few duplicate proofs as well. The sub-subseries also includes 8x10 prints of many of these images. The images include many unpopulated landscapes, as well as images with people (especially farm school boys). The photographs were taken at a transitional time for the CAS, as the newly acquired Bowdoin Farm property in New Hamburg N.Y. was about to become a camp and farm school, replacing the Brace Farm School.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2040_op4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Country Facilities - 43 5x7 proofs by Lewis Hine numbered 1-39</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1928</unitdate><container id="aspace_351943a0275b55d8de4dbed7d07dcf2a" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022058]" type="Offsite-Box">978</container><container parent="aspace_351943a0275b55d8de4dbed7d07dcf2a" type="Folder">1</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4540830818_30d091216d_t.jpg" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Country Facilities " xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Country Facilities</p></daodesc></dao><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n-yhs/sets/72157623998047504/" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Click to view images" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Click to view images</p></daodesc></dao></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2041_2di" level="file"><did><unittitle>Country Facilities - 19 8x10 prints by Lewis Hine corresponding to selected proofs numbered 1-39</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1928</unitdate><container id="aspace_804f91a8fc5b26cffadfa6cc3fe3a409" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022058]" type="Offsite-Box">978</container><container parent="aspace_804f91a8fc5b26cffadfa6cc3fe3a409" type="Folder">2</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4540856012_36fe481bff_t.jpg" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Country Facilities " xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Country Facilities</p></daodesc></dao><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n-yhs/sets/72157623873741211/" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Click to view images" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Click to view images</p></daodesc></dao></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2042_515" level="file"><did><unittitle>Country Property Landscapes - 30 5x7 proofs by Lewis Hine numbered 40-70</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1928</unitdate><container id="aspace_de5f2e8e812f16041931d972c2ccb9a0" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022058]" type="Offsite-Box">978</container><container parent="aspace_de5f2e8e812f16041931d972c2ccb9a0" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2043_cet" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bowdoin Farm Property Landscapes - 8 8x10 prints by Lewis Hine corresponding to selected proofs numbered 41-50</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1928</unitdate><container id="aspace_59f212fa642671872c7ea79e03fe8c0d" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022058]" type="Offsite-Box">978</container><container parent="aspace_59f212fa642671872c7ea79e03fe8c0d" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2044_qje" level="file"><did><unittitle>Brace Farm - Farm School and Camp - 15 5x7 proofs by Lewis Hine numbered 71-84</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1928</unitdate><container id="aspace_e011e00cba95c8bb65f9734a8ef58bff" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022058]" type="Offsite-Box">978</container><container parent="aspace_e011e00cba95c8bb65f9734a8ef58bff" type="Folder">5</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n-yhs/sets/72157623998060542/" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Click to view images" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Click to view images</p></daodesc></dao><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4540863442_299a8cb532_t.jpg" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Brace Farm " xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Brace Farm</p></daodesc></dao></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref83_68v" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Sub-Subseries XIII.3.B - Photographs of Farm Schools</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4533761c3576dcf06565c5de07835d23"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Brace Farm School, in Valhalla N.Y., operated 1894-1928 with the goal of exposing boys and young men to farm work, to ease the transition to farm life they would experience after subsequent placement by the Emigration/Placing-Out Program. Bowdoin Farm School, in New Hamburg N.Y., began operating in 1929 and provided a more extensive farm training program to prepare young men for employment on farms.</p><p>This sub-subseries contains photographs of the CAS farm schools arranged chronologically with Brace Farm School first, followed by Bowdoin Farm School, and then unidentified Brace and/or Bowdoin Farm School. Within these divisions, folders are further subdivided by photographer, and arranged numerically by photograph number within the folders. The sub-subseries concludes with a set of 8 small format disbound photo albums entitled "Bowdoin Farm Boys" from 1935-1943, consisting of 549 2.75 x 4.5 portraits of young men who attended the farm school. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2045_oeq" level="file"><did><unittitle>Brace Farm School - 5 6x8 prints and 1 8x10 print by Underwood &amp;

The Bowdoin Camp photographs include a bound photo album. Miscellaneous photographs are at the end of the sub-subseries. Goodhue camp also served as a home for girls preparing to be sent to foster care. Some images of Goodhue in that function are interfiled with the Goodhue camp images, and noted on the folder. CAS camps shared facilities with CAS farm schools, so researchers should be aware that a few images of camp facilities may also be found in sub-subseries XIII.3.A and B.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2070_gd7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photo Album - "Boys' Summer Camp at Temple and Helen P.

All except one are reprints of photographs found in Series XIII.2 and XIII.3 above. The one photograph which has no smaller or vintage counterpart is a 10.5x14 print of Franklin Delano Roosevelt visiting Bowdoin Farm on August 10, 1933.</p><p>XIII.6.C - Other Photographs - contains 3 folders of miscellaneous photographs which were neither commissioned by the CAS nor depicting images of the CAS, but which nevertheless made their way into the CAS files. 1 folder contains vintage prints by Lewis Hine, from his photo series on child labor in cotton mills and agriculture; the images were from 1908 and 1915, before he was hired by the CAS.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref94_1gz" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Sub-Subseries XIII.6.A - Photo Albums</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e7e556a0fe0581c39005e4ec14e9ed5b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This sub-subseries contains 4 photo albums - 2 bound albums arranged chronologically (by Evert Jansen Wendell, ca. 1900-1910; and an album assembled by an unknown person at the CAS using photos by Lewis Hine, 1928), followed by 2 disbound albums arranged chronologically (probably by Louisa de Ferrari Weygandt or Lillian Weygandt ca. 1906, 1910 and undated; and by an unknown person or people at the CAS, ca. 1936-1944).</p><p>Two of these albums present a broad visual picture of the CAS: The Hine album contains a selection of some of the prints also collected in proof form in subseries XIII.2-4 above. The album documents the work of the CAS in various locations, with captions.</p><p>The 1936-1944 album/report is a photo essay which appears to be a draft, with original photographs attached to the pages by photocorners. The author(s) and photographer are unknown. It is unknown whether any final version of the report was ever produced. The entire volume was housed in a 3-ring binder. The section relating to Bowdoin Farm, placed at the back of the binder, was written in 1939, with 2 supplemental pages from 1944. The Bowdoin Farm pages have numerous editorial comments penciled or penned in. The other sections from the front of the binder (Centers, Newsboys, Convalescent Homes) appear to have been written in 1944 and perhaps constitute a later draft, as they have fewer editorial comments. The section on Convalescent Homes does not include photographs, but the other sections are richly illustrated with many 2.5"x 2.5" photographs, attached to the pages by photocorners. Some photographs are missing from the pages. There is no section on camps, but there are four loose photographs which may or may not have been intended for a section on that subject.</p><p>The other two photo albums were created by CAS-affiliated people, but the albums' relationship to the work of the CAS is unclear. The 1900-1910 photo album was assembled by Evert Jansen Wendell, a trustee of the CAS from 1902-1917 who is well represented throughout this collection by photographs and other material. His album consists of photographs from a trip to Cuba. It is probable that either Louisa de Ferrari Weygandt, Italian School principal from 1860-1921 or her daughter Lillian Weygandt, principal 1921-1930, is the creator of the 1906-1910 album, which was kept at their center until it was forwarded to the CAS archives at an unknown date. The photographs depict people in the country, possibly Venoge, NY.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2179_kja" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photo Album created by Evert Jansen Wendell - Photographs from Cuba</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1900-1910</unitdate><container id="aspace_8515337da1a03cf3fbbc3045150e8cbc" label="Mixed Materials [10170000021197]" type="Offsite-Box">1247</container><container parent="aspace_8515337da1a03cf3fbbc3045150e8cbc" type="Box">989</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2180_5hr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photo Album -
