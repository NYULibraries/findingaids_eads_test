    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>André de Dienes (1913-1985) was a Hungarian American fashion photographer best known for his early portraits of the actress Marilyn Monroe. </p><p>Photojouralist Ken Regan (d. 2012) worked for over five decades documenting pop culture, sports, foreign conflicts, and other current events. Credited with over 200 magazine covers, Regan was most well-known for a discretion and professionalism which earned him intimate shooting access to famous politicians, musicians, and other celebrities.  </p><p>Regan also covered major events for magazines such as Time,  Sports Illustrated, Life, and Newsweek. In the 1970s he founded Camera 5, an agency of 15 photographers who covered wars, riots and demonstrations, and other national and international hard news and human interest stories.</p>  </bioghist>
