    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Robinson Family Papers mainly document the immediate family of Dr. Beverley Robinson, his wife Anna Foster Robinson, and their children Beverley R., Herman, Pauline, and Anna Robinson. Although members of the extended family are represented, most of the correspondence, scrapbooks, dairies, photographs, and volumes in the collection relate to the work and travels of this immediate family. The collection is organized by family member, related family members, and charities. Unidentified items are grouped according to type of material. Some of the letters are in French.</p><p>The family member who is most represented in the collection is Pauline Robinson. The letters received by Pauline Robinson, daughter of Dr. Beverley Robinson and Anna Foster Robinson, as well as her scrapbooks and memorabilia, constitute a large amount of the collection. Her scrapbooks include documentation from society and charity functions such as invitations, pictures, programs, and lists of guests. Most of the other family members are represented in the collection only through their correspondence and memorabilia. </p><p>Other notable items include the elder Beverley Robinson's letters home while he was studying medicine in France and letters from Herman and Beverley R. to their mother Anna describing time spent with Teddy Roosevelt when President McKinley was assassinated. The collection also contains scrapbooks of letters to Beverley R. and the Robinson family expressing sympathy over the suicide of Herman. Almost all of the information on the suicide of Herman is located within these scrapbooks. </p><p>The collection supports research on upper class society, particularly women, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Pauline Robinson's scrapbooks document the social life of a young debutante and the society parties, trips, and amusements she attended. The collection also has a significant amount of material on upper class women's charity work. The correspondence and scrapbooks explain the social problems addressed by the various forms of community work and the expectations of the programs. Some of the materials also document the attitudes of the women involved in the charities towards the immigrant or lower class beneficiaries of the charities, and the women's troubles dealing with bureaucratic city agencies. Since most of the letters are among immediate and extended family members, the collection also documents general family relationships. This is best shown in the letters to the family after the death of Herman.</p><p>The collection contains little material on Dr. Beverley Robinson's life as a doctor and Beverley R Robinson's work as an attorney. There is also no information on the elder Beverley Robinson's time on the Gettysburg campaign. Women, if married, are included under their last married surname. </p>  </scopecontent>

The bulk of the series consists of Pauline Robinson's numerous scrapbooks which include clippings, letters and memorabilia regarding social events and charity work. The scrapbooks are in chronological order and two of them have been disbound and foldered for conservation purposes. </p><p>The scrapbooks entitled "Year Books" specifically detail New York City social events. They consist of invitations and programs from dinners, concerts, plays, parties, dances, and weddings, and include newspaper clippings of the events and lists of those who attended. Pauline Robinson's volume "House Party Book," includes the photographs and names of companions who accompanied her on many East Coast trips. Although Pauline Robinson's own debut party is not covered in the scrapbooks, other social affairs such as Alice Roosevelt's debutante party and the Astors' Ball are documented. </p><p>Also of interest in this series is a volume entitled a "Chap Record" in which Pauline has listed many of the numerous "chaps" who she is acquainted with, and has rated them according to various categories.</p><p>Much of Pauline Robinson's correspondence is from family members describing recent trips or from others recognizing her for her charity work. Of particular interest is a 1915 letter from a Mildred Wallace describing her reaction to the sinking of the Lusitania and her personal reaction to seeing Jane Addams at a lecture on the "Woman Question." The writings in this series are mainly short essays or articles which Pauline Robinson attempted to have published. Other specific information on the charity work of Pauline Robinson can be found in Series 14: Charities. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref15_w1r" level="otherlevel"

id="aspace_c52feb34c8ed295add8f2f351260bcf6"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Most of this series is correspondence. Anna Foster Robinson's letters before her marriage in 1875 are from friends and family and detail everyday routines and travel. A few of the letters are from Arthur Cummings, a former servant. Most of the later letters are from her children, particularly Pauline. Pauline mostly describes her domestic and overseas travels, many of which were at the DuPont estate at Winterthur. The correspondence also contains a few letters from the Robinson children that detail meetings with presidents or other famous people. Letters dated September 1901 from her sons Beverley and Herman describe spending time with Teddy Roosevelt on Mount Marcy. During this trip, Roosevelt received telegrams notifying him of McKinley's death and informing him of his new role as President of the United States. A 1899 letter from Pauline, shortly before her debut, describes a visit with President McKinley and the First Lady Ida McKinley. A 1920 letter from Pauline describes how her friend Edith Wharton looks "broken and subdued." </p><p>Anna Foster Robinson's European travel diaries provide daily entries on the art, architecture, and scenery of the numerous cities and towns she visited throughout Europe. However, these accounts generally lack description of locals or discussion of current events in Europe. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref59_y5s" level="otherlevel"

to Dr. Beverley Robinson and letters addressed by the Robinson children to both him and Anna, (often Mamma and Pappa). The letters are mainly personal, from friends and family describing everyday events or travel. There is little correspondence regarding professional matters and some of the correspondence is in French. Almost all of the letters from 1903 express support for his son Beverley R. Robinson's candidacy for Alderman. The correspondence also includes letters from Beverley Robinson to family members while he was studying medicine in Paris during the American Civil War. Although Beverley mentions the cholera epidemic in Paris during that time, his letters mostly detail his homesickness and his studies.</p><p>This series also contains writings and memorabilia for Beverley Robinson. It includes some of his published medical writings as well as certificate from Pennsylvania Adjutant General's Office stating he served for 90 days in the State Militia. Other than this certificate, there is no information on Beverley Robinson's efforts in the Gettysburg campaign in the American Civil War. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref90_dj2" level="otherlevel"

Later letters from 1903 are from friends and family pledging their support for his election for Alderman of the 27th Assembly District. Also included in this series is a scrapbook of sympathy telegrams and letters to Beverley R. on the death of Herman. The memorabilia for Beverley R. includes material on his schooling as well as a very small amount of material on his campaign for Alderman and Assemblyman.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref107_ls3" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Beverley R.
