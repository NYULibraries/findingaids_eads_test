<p>The Bruce Davidson Photograph Collection consists of about 400 photographs taken by Bruce Davidson, an American photographer whose work is often focused on the relationship between people and place. The collection is arranged into two series.</p><p>Series I: East 100th Street consists of 14 images from Davidson's photo project of the same name. These photos were taken between 1966 and 1968 in the neighborhood of East Harlem in New York City.They document street activity, and particularly focus on children. The modern photographic prints are produced from the vintage negatives and signed on the verso by the photographer. These photographs were donated by the artist in 2001.</p><p>Series II: Photo Projects contains 394 images from over 20 of Davidson's photo projects undertaken between 1957 and 2001. These photographs were donated by an anonymous donor in 2018. </p><p>Photos in this series come from Davidson's projects documenting the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force; the Civil Rights movement in the U.S., including the 1965 Selma March; street life in Chicago in 1989; a circus; the streets and gardens of Paris; and English, Scottish and Welsh towns. In addition, there are portraits of Isaac Bashevis Singer, a Polish-American writer in Yiddish.</p><p>Also included are selections from Davidson's projects that focus on various aspects of life in New York City: a 1950s teenage gang from Brooklyn; children at the American Museum of Natural History in 1960; the subway in the 1980s; Central Park in the 1990s; the construction of the Verrazzano Bridge in 1963-1964; New York Harbor, including the South Street Seaport, the Statue of Liberty, the shoreline, boats, ships, dock workers and ship crew members; and the Lower East Side from the 1950s-1990s. </p><p>This series also includes photographs from the East 100th Street photo essay that comprises Series I, along with images from Davidson's 1998 project which revisits the same East Harlem neighborhood and explores the changes that occurred over intervening 30 years.</p>  </scopecontent>
