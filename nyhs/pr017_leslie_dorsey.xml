    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Leslie Dorsey (1912-1979) started his career as a display manager for a specialty shop in Philadelphia.  Sometime after 1940, he moved to New York City, where he designed displays for Richard Hudnut cosmetic products.  He also designed hotel and restaurant interiors, and wrote, with Janice Devine, a whimsical history of American hotels entitled <emph render="italic">Fare Thee Well: A Backward Look at Two Centuries of Historic American Hostelries, Fashionable Spas and Seaside Resorts</emph> (New York: Crown Publisher, 1964).</p><p>A Victorian-era enthusiast, Dorsey also collected pictorial images from Godey's magazines and other period books and catalogs, and assembled them into scrapbooks for reference use in his interior design work. He also used these images to prepare collages which he marketed as "Decou-Optiques" to clients for use in advertisements or background murals. Eventually, Dorsey made his extensive image collection available for "rental" to commercial clients, effectively serving as an early stock image library.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Leslie Dorsey Collection of Pictorial Clippings spans the period from 1850 to 1970 and consists primarily of images from Dorsey's extensive research library of engravings, magazine and catalog illustrations, chromos, and other printed ephemera and illustrations from the Victorian period.  Also included are examples of Dorsey's various creative endeavors, including a book proposal, concept scrapbooks for two theatrical musicals, and a number of collages. </p><p>The collection has been organized into five series.  Series I, Clippings and wood engravings, includes images that Dorsey cut out of period magazines and catalogs and arranged by topic in three ring binders.  The binders have been disbound and the contents housed in acid-free folders.  Topics are listed alphabetically in the box and folder list, and include, among many others, Agricultural Implements and Farming, Animals, Children, Drugs and Druggists, and Interior Decorations.  There are also multiple folders relating to fashion, arranged by date.  </p><p>Series II, Creative Projects and Research Files, includes Dorsey's proposal for a book on the Centennial Exhibition as well as "concept" sketchbooks containing proposals for two theatrical musicals ("The Ballad of Josie and Jim," about the murder of robber baron Jim Fiske over actress Josie Mansfield, and "Centennial Quartette," a celebration of the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia).  The scrapbooks have been disbound and housed in acid-free folders.  This series also includes some of Dorsey's research files, consisting of contemporaneous newspaper and magazine articles on the Bicentennial of 1976 and a few other topics (Antiques, Art Nouveau, the Metropolitan Opera House and Restaurants and Food).  In addition, there are a few folders of ephemera, primarily relating to architectural preservation and tourism in New York City. </p><p>Series III, Scrapbooks, includes images and other materials that Dorsey assembled into scrapbooks to illustrate various topics.  Topics include dining, drinking, hotels, Christmas, sports, and fairs and expositions (Crystal Palace, Centennial, Columbian, Louisiana Purchase, and Pan-American).  There are also a number of scrapbooks relating to New York City, covering a broad range of topics such as Equestrian, 23rd Street, Courthouses and Criminals, and New York City Markets.  Additional topics are identified in the box and folder list.  </p><p>Series IV, Collages and graphics, includes examples of Dorsey's "Decou-Optiques," or collages, which he apparently marketed to clients for use in advertisements or as background murals for articles or products.  This series includes both black and white and color collages, depicting various period and historical scenes, including many Christmas scenes.  Also included are examples of some of the materials Dorsey used to create the collages, such as decals and cut-out figures.</p><p>Dorsey indexed some of his scrapbooks, and these can be found in Series V, Indexes and business papers.  Also included in this series are articles and press releases relating to Dorsey, examples of advertisements and articles from Dorsey's clients that incorporate his images, and photographic portraits of Dorsey.</p>  </scopecontent>

Clippings and wood engravings</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0c8eb07c4b417441742be6f092c41600"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists primarily of advertisements and images from Victorian-era publications.  Dorsey cut the images out, pasted them onto notebook paper, and arranged them into three-ring binders by topic. The binders have been disbound and the material housed in acid-free folders.</p><p>The illustrations in the series cover a broad range of topics, from fashion (the largest single category) to fire-fighting equipment.  Many of the topics relate to household and interior design, for example, cases and boxes, silver and cutlery, garden statuary, lighting, house design, etc.  There are also a number of pictorial vignettes and genre scenes of children, courtship and romance, and outdoor recreation. Animals and plants are also well-represented.  </p><p>Although most of the images arranged by subject are wood engravings, there is also a separate category of "wood engravings" at the end of the series, which was originally housed in three binders.  Dorsey prepared a subject index for these binders (included in Box 11, Folder 1), which lists the following topics: artists, automobiles, balloons, bicycles, buildings, children, Christmas, circus, clocks and watches, design devices, drinking, entertainment, flowers, food and dining, general store, home furnishing, horses and wagons, hotels, houses, medicine, men, music, office furnishings, optical, patriotic and symbols, perfume, photography, rope, rural, ships, sports, stores, telegram, toys, trains, trolley, weather, the west, winter, and women.</p></scopecontent><c

Also included are several "concept" scrapbooks containing proposals for two theatrical musicals:  "The Ballad of Josie and Jim", about the murder of robber baron Jim Fiske over actress Josie Mansfield, and "Centennial Quartette", a celebration of the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. Dorsey also submitted the latter for consideration as a motion picture or television production, as is reflected by correspondence included in the series.  None of these projects were realized.  </p><p>In addition, the series contains some of Dorsey's research files, consisting primarily of contemporaneous newspaper and magazine articles on the Bicentennial of 1976 and a few other topics (Antiques, Art Nouveau, the Metropolitan Opera House and Restaurants and Food).  There are also a few folders of ephemera, primarily relating to architectural preservation and tourism in New York City in the 1960's and 1970's. Among the ephemera items are flyers for lectures on architectural preservation, brochures and maps for walking tours of New York City, brochures on churches and other historic buildings, and a 1905 Report of the Queens United Civic Association's Committee on City Plan and Parks. In the folder labeled "Assorted Ephemera" are tickets to the 1964 World's Fair, the 1974 Art Deco Exposition, and programs for two performances at Carnegie Hall (1898 and 1899) and a 1929 production of the Frieburg Passion Play at the New York Hippodrome.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref356_0r0" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Ballad of Josie and Jim (folder 1 of 2)</unittitle><container id="aspace_fdb580da6e4e60c56812f1fae8476d9a" label="Mixed Materials [1804000032078]" type="Offsite-Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_fdb580da6e4e60c56812f1fae8476d9a" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref357_bi3" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Ballad of Josie and Jim (folder 2 of 2)</unittitle><container id="aspace_cda926aa210ebccd9ce1cd44fa9694c0" label="Mixed Materials [1804000032078]" type="Offsite-Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_cda926aa210ebccd9ce1cd44fa9694c0" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref358_3ql" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Centennial Quartette for the Musical of 1876" (folder 1 of 2)</unittitle><container id="aspace_41292cb23de3881694b19e0910d64c18" label="Mixed Materials [1804000032079]" type="Offsite-Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_41292cb23de3881694b19e0910d64c18" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref359_zw1" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Centennial Quartette for the Musical of 1876" (folder 2 of 2)</unittitle><container id="aspace_5d9b9b19da1226609e18e6039e37577a" label="Mixed Materials [1804000032079]" type="Offsite-Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_5d9b9b19da1226609e18e6039e37577a" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref360_emo" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Centennial Quartette," manuscript and correspondence, 1972-1973</unittitle><container id="aspace_d32ae00d2597f5a34bee6849bc34a7ec" label="Mixed Materials [1804000032079]" type="Offsite-Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_d32ae00d2597f5a34bee6849bc34a7ec" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref361_avp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Centennial Exhibition Book Proposal- Notes (folder 1 of 2)</unittitle><container id="aspace_50e0188cafd75776dcf958db46714618" label="Mixed Materials [1804000032079]" type="Offsite-Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_50e0188cafd75776dcf958db46714618" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref362_hv4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Centennial Exhibition Book Proposal- Notes (folder 2 of 2)</unittitle><container id="aspace_ed9ddb025c62ec11f5f332fbd6c11677" label="Mixed Materials [1804000032079]" type="Offsite-Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_ed9ddb025c62ec11f5f332fbd6c11677" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref363_b65" level="file"><did><unittitle>Centennial Exhibition Book Proposal- Notes and correspondence </unittitle><container id="aspace_ccef50e2c48856d1260c92d3d9c527b6" label="Mixed Materials [1804000032079]" type="Offsite-Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_ccef50e2c48856d1260c92d3d9c527b6" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref364_gah" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings &amp; Musicals, 1972-1973</unittitle><container id="aspace_977c9e3265859983a94dec7c5f7a85c6" label="Mixed Materials [1804000032079]" type="Offsite-Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_977c9e3265859983a94dec7c5f7a85c6" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref365_j6m" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bicentennial Clippings, March 1967- December 1970</unittitle><container id="aspace_a30b450ceb8ffa041532bfedbf4eb98a" label="Mixed Materials [1804000032080]" type="Offsite-Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_a30b450ceb8ffa041532bfedbf4eb98a" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref366_2x9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bicentennial Clippings, January -

Materials include newspaper and magazine clippings, articles and other textual material, illustrations, photographs, postcards, greeting cards, advertisements, programs, and many other types of ephemera.  Although the bulk of the materials are vintage, Dorsey also mixed in some contemporaneous (circa 1960's - 1970's) photographs and articles.</p><p>Dorsey arranged these materials into elaborate topical scrapbooks that serve as interesting and creative reference files on a broad range of subjects. The largest segment of this series relates to New York City, covering topics such as Wall Street, the Fire Department, street cleaning, the poor and destitute, and many others which are specifically identified in the box and folder list, below. 
There are also scrapbooks relating to other American cities and states, especially the American West, and to European countries and other foreign locales. Other topics include dining, hotels and resorts (in New York and elsewhere), sports, ships, trains, houses, furnishings and people (including African Americans and other ethnic groups).  There are a number of scrapbooks relating to fairs and expositions, including the Crystal Palace, Centennial Exposition, World's Columbian Exposition, Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and the Panama-Pacific International Exposition.  </p><p>The original binders were also created by Dorsey, and feature cardboard covers with sometimes elaborate lettering and decorations, bound together with three metal rings.  The scrapbooks have been disbound and re-housed in acid-free folders.  A few representative examples of the binders have been retained.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref157_l5j" level="file"><did><unittitle>NYC -- Volume 9A: Equestrian, Clubs, Dogs, Entertainment,

Dorsey apparently marketed these collages as "Decou-Optiques" to advertisers and other clients for use as a decorative element or for a background. Among the scenes depicted are the 1876 Centennial (possibly used by Dorsey to pitch his book and musical projects), Christmas scenes, winter scenes, and various Western-themed scenes.</p><p>The majority of the collages are in black and white; color collages are identified in the box and folder list. The lettering system is Dorsey's.  </p><p>Also included in the series are examples of the materials Dorsey used to create the collages, such as decals and cut-out figures.
