    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Orrin Sage Wightman (1873-1965) was born and raised in New York City. He received a B.A. and a M. D. from New York University in 1895 and 1898, respectively. In 1905, Wightman married Purl Parker and they had two children, Julia Parker and Orrin Sage Jr. </p><p>Wightman, an internist, practiced medicine in New York City and was active in many medical organizations. He practiced at Gouverneur, City, and New York Polyclinic Hospitals, among others. In 1923 he served as president of the New York County Medical Society and the organization awarded him a gold medal for achievement in 1965. He was president of the Medical Society of the State of New York in 1925. From 1925 to 1934 Wightman was editor in chief of the New York State Journal of Medicine. He also served as chairman of the New York State Medical Grievance Committee. Wightman was an active member in the New York Academy of Medicine as well, founded its medical information bureau in 1928 and received from that organization an award of outstanding service in 1952. He also served as chairman of the board from 1946 until his death. </p><p>During World War I, Wightman served as a major in the United States Army Medical Corps, and in 1917 went on an American Red Cross medical mission to Russia. The mission began by boat from Vancouver, B.C. to Japan, and continued by train through China and Mongolia to Russia and finally Romania. Wightman photographed his activities on this trip, and when he returned to the United States he spoke to the press and to many church groups and clubs about his experiences, on behalf of the new Soviet Union and about America's potential relationship to the country. His photographs were available for purchase, but were never officially published. In 1928, Wightman published Diary of an American Physician in the Russian Revolution in 1917, a written account of his trip through Russia</p><p>Throughout his life Wightman traveled throughout the United States and Europe, and photographically documented these trips. He built the first seven cameras he owned and continued to be interested in photographic technology. He was a member of the Royal Photographic Society and an honorary member of the Photographic Society of America. In 1955, he published Early Days of Coastal Georgia, photographs of St. Simons Island and surrounding areas in Georgia</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Wightman collection consists of 13 linear feet of photographic prints, celluloid negatives, glass negatives, lantern slides, autochromes, glass stereographs and viewer, assorted small notebooks, manuscript materials, and a draft of his published account of the trip to Russia. The collection has been arranged into the following series: 1895 Bicycle trip to France and Spain, Pathological slides, Medical, Smokarol Tobacco, Family and Scenes of New York, and the American Red Cross Mission to Russia. These series include documentation of Russia and the Far East during World War I and the Russian Revolution, the development of the medical profession in New York City between the 1890s and 1910s, Central Park and downtown New York scenes, and one New York family's activities and vacations during the early part of the twentieth century. </p><p>The great majority of the collection is in good physical condition and were labeled and numbered by Wightman. Most photos that were not labeled by him (mainly the stereographs of New York City and the later exhibition photos of European scenes) are of identifiable places. There are many evidential papers accompanying the Russia series (poems written by Wightman, letters to him from family and colleagues, and his account of the trip) that aid in the full documentation of that trip. The collection includes 64 autochromes, an early method of printing color photographs onto glass; most of these are of Wightman's family, are physically and chemically stable, and still retain their brilliant color.</p><p>For administrative purposes, and since there are gaps in Wightman's numbering schemes, an artificial numbering system was imposed upon each series, although the original numbers are noted in the index to each series. </p>  </scopecontent>
  <arrangement id="aspace_7eae3e6628cf5a7331a45cf17be66634">
    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The materials are physically arranged according to type of material: slides, glass negatives, glass autochromes, negatives, unnumbered prints, numbered prints, exhibition prints, 8x10 prints, manuscript folders, photo albums, glass stereographs, and a box of the original containers for the materials.</p><p>The materials have been intellectually organized into the following series:</p><p>Series 1: 1895 Bicycle trip to England and France</p><p>Series 2: Pathological slides</p><p>Series 3: Medical images, 1898-1916</p><p>Series 4: Smokarol tobacco</p><p>Series 5: Family and New York scenes</p><p>Series 6: American Red Cross Mission to Russia</p><p>Very brittle manuscript material was photocopied to create a use copy. The originals of these materials are stored in Box 29, Folder 12.</p>  </arrangement>

Of note are views of Collegiate Church and its sexton, and of the garden at Lenoir.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref50_78c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Numbers 1 - 59</unittitle><container id="aspace_f62b24ec43629e966a48dd09ec9c02ea" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref51_f0s" level="file"><did><unittitle>Numbers 60 - 117</unittitle><container id="aspace_56ea145171b65db55638a635e385c505" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref52_j4t" level="file"><did><unittitle>Numbers 118 - 141</unittitle><container id="aspace_427d90543d4c5458fb4ec40b5d2b35de" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">6</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref54_uaf" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 5.E: Prints</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e4125e0be3ed77d06003a0c854d33281"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Encompasses 11x14 exhibition prints and portraits and small family snapshots. The large prints are housed together and feature images from Wightman's travels to England, Scotland, France, Morocco, Greece, and locales in Northern New England. The buildings of the New York Academy of Medicine and the Boyce Thompson Institute are also shown, the Institute from a great many angles. Portraits include a Dr. Rigika, Julia Parker Wightman, Corvell Thomas, Theodore Hanneman, Roy Chapman Andrews, Catherine Dale Owen, and William Boyce Thompson. New York scenes are also represented, many images are of Central Park in winter 1944. The Bronx River is also shown in winter with ice formations around bridges and along its riverbank. New York buildings shown include Heavenly Rest Church, Grant's Tomb, Columbia University Library, Pennsylvania Station, and general views of the Manhattan skyline. The small snapshots show groups of people at leisure, Wightman and Parker family members, various subjects such as sailboats, goats, New York street scenes, and some shots of "C.C. Dula hoeing his tobacco patch at Lenoir."</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref55_q8j" level="file"><did><unittitle>Unnumbered prints</unittitle><container id="aspace_5a4c7976ea6954b2bb5e128229f6f818" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">25</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref56_4wf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Exhibition prints</unittitle><container id="aspace_5a6d9e84afd270a86b40d0fffc9b9f3e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">27</container></did></c></c></c><c id="aspace_ref58_svi" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 6: American Red Cross Mission to Russia</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8cdb36913ac20842102b36d84d559fc3"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>In July 1917, Wightman traveled to Russia on a medical mission organized by the American Red Cross. The mission was led by Colonel William Boyce Thompson. The Americans sailed from Vancouver, B.C. to Japan, and then traveled by the Trans-Siberian Rail Road through Manchuria, Mongolia, and across Russia to Petrograd. Wightman was issued permission by the Russian government to take still and moving film images of the trip and of war conditions in Russia. He was technically assisted in this by Lt. Harold Wyckoff, and was accompanied throughout his travels in Russia by a Cossack guide and translator, Capt. A. Ilowosky. In addition to documenting the mission's train journey, Wightman traveled to small towns in Russia and to Moscow and Odessa to take photos and films. He then traveled to the war front in Romania and photographed soldiers and hospitals there. In late October and November, Wightman traveled back across Russia and sailed home from China.</p><p>While in Odessa, Wightman was robbed of his passport, money, and photographic permits. Much of the correspondence in Subseries 6, Folder 1 relates to this theft and the subsequent necessity for emergency permits and passport. </p><p>The second half of 1917 saw Russia embattled and exhausted from fighting the Great War. One of the special subjects of Wightman's work, The Russian All-Women's Battalion, consisted of women training to fight, in response to some Russian men's refusal to go to battle. Most of the images from Romania show intense war devastation to small towns, and document the plight of refugees. Wightman's time in Russia coincided as well with major political upheaval. The overthrow of the Czarist regime by the Communist revolutionaries occurred in October 1917. Upon his return to the United States, Wightman gave many illustrated lectures and often discussed the Russian political situation and how it pertained to the end of the war (clippings and documents pertaining to these talks are in Subseries 6, Folders 9 and 10 below.) </p><p>The photographs depict peasant life in Manchuria, Mongolia, Russia and Romania. They show bread lines and vendors along the Trans-Siberian Rail Road. The All-Women's Battalion is pictured at leisure activities and in training. Russian and Romanian soldiers are also pictured in preparation for and at the frontlines. The Russian YMCA and its activities are documented, as is the flight of some early Nieuport British airplanes. In addition to these human scenes, Wightman photographed many historically important or architecturally notable buildings in Moscow, Petrograd and Odessa. While in Romania, Wightman had an audience with the royal family, and they are pictured at a soldier's hospital attending to patients. While in China on his way back to the United States, Wightman stayed in Peking and Shanghai, and took many pictures of street activity in those cities. He also photographed the Forbidden City, a complex of ornate temples and gardens. </p><p>The documents in Subseries 6 and 7 supplement the photographs and contribute to a more complete understanding of Wightman's experiences and views of his trip. Although none of Wightman's moving picture film is with this collection, the film log in Subseries 8 gives a shot by shot narrative of what kinds of activities he filmed and considered valuable documentation. </p><p>Wightman numbered a series of approximately 400 photographs of his trip which appear within the various forms below. Although he took many more pictures, this set seems to be one with which he lectured and from which he tried to sell prints to interested parties. The most coherent representation of this set is found in the numbered lantern slides which were originally housed in four wooden boxes with a typed index. The negatives and the prints (both in albums and loose) correspond to this numbered set, although an exact correlation of images does not exist between the differing media. A Microsoft Access database was created to provide quick reference among the different media. For example, if the title of a lantern slide is known, the database will show whether or not a negative or print of that same image exists in the collection. Each subseries below contains a complete (or a large part of the) numbered set, as well as additional and often complementary pictures.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref59_0tl" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 6.A: Negatives</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7a39426383155bf8296e7bf63b0a87fc"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>The great majority of these are negatives that correspond to lantern slides and prints.

Lists of photographic supplies and receipts for supplies and processing both before and after the trip (Folder 3) document of what kind of equipment was used and its expense. Russian language documents in Folder 4, mainly passes and awards, are interesting evidential documents of the time period in Russia. </p><p>Folder 7 contains three poems written by Wightman during his time in Russia, "To the Princess Varvar Kropotkin, one of Russoa's (sic) Noblewomen," "The Cossack," and "Petrograd." Also of interest in this folder are hand drawn and lettered menus from Wightman's time at the Romanian front. These depict the kinds of food eaten by Romanian officers and have detailed watercolor and pastel drawings and cartoons of war scenes and women. Folder 9 contains a Japanese fan.Folder 9 consists of three small notebooks used by Wightman to record expenses, lists of family and friends to whom postcards should be sent, photographic supplies bought and needed, still and moving picture records, and other lists and notations. One of these notebooks contained many small family snapshots and notes in an inside pocket.
