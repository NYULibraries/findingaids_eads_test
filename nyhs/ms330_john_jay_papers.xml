<p>There are a variety of reasons why John Jay is a historical figure of note. He was a Founding Father, the first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, a politician, and a diplomat, to name only a few. Jay was born on December 12, 1745 in New York City to Peter Jay and his wife, Mary Van Cortlandt. Jay was the sixth out of seven surviving children. Of those seven children, two were left blind by smallpox.</p><p>Jay was educated at Kings College (later renamed Columbia University) in 1760. Upon his graduation in 1764 he became a law clerk and was admitted to the bar in 1768. During this period, Jay served on the New York-New Jersey Border Commission. After his admission to the bar, Jay joined with Robert R. Livingston Jr. to form a law firm. He later went on to his own practice in 1771. </p><p>In 1774 Jay married New Jersey governor William Livingston's daughter Sarah. That same year Jay also got involved with politics in New York that would eventually escalate into the American Revolution. As far as the Revolution went, Jay began as a moderate. He was involved in New York's Committee of 50 and the Continental Congress where he served as a delegate from 1774-1776.  Jay was also a member of the New York Constitutional Convention and served as First Chief Justice of New York in 1777. In 1778 he was a delegate and later elected to President of the Continental Congress.
Jay's diplomacy went international when he was appointed Minster to Spain in 1779, Minister to treat the peace with Great Britain in 1782, and then Secretary of Foreign Affairs in 1784. </p><p>In 1787 and 1788, Jay's attention returned to domestic matters. Joining in with Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, Jay contributed to what became known as the <emph render="italic"> Federalist Papers</emph>. Jay authored essays two, three, four, five, and sixty-four. (He suffered from an illness that limited his involvement after the fifth essay.) This collection of essays was meant to persuade the newly minted Americans to accepted the Constitution, which would replace the Article of Confederation, which were the first governing document for the United States. Jay was quite influential in getting New York to ratify the Constitution.</p><p>Jay's role changed again in 1798 when President George Washington appointed him as the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, the highest court in the country. At the time, there was nothing to stop the Chief Justice from actively participating in the country's politics. Proving this, Jay ran for governor of New York in 1792, only to lose to George Clinton. In 1794, Jay was appointed an envoy to Britain to negotiate issues, such as border disputes, that caused continuing tension between the two countries. Among the terms of the treaty, the British would leave their forts on the United States' western border, and the United States granted Most Favored Nation trading status to the British. However, there were issues that were left unaddressed, such as impressment, which upset the American public. Although public was not in favor of Jay's Treaty, the Senate ultimately ratified it.</p><p>Upon Jay's return to the United States in 1795, he discovered that he had been elected governor of New York. After resigning as Chief Justice, Jay served two terms as governor of New York, and addressed issues such as fortifying the cities against possible attack and Indian relations. Jay retired in 1801. President Thomas Jefferson attempted to get Jay to return to the Supreme Court bench, but Jay refused.</p><p>Once out of politics, Jay continued to pursue some of his other interests. One of which was his religion. Jay was a practicing Anglican and served as warden of Trinity Church in New York. He became president of the American Bible Society. Another interest was the anti-slavery movement, which seems contradictory since Jay owned slaves. Jay's interest in abolishing slavery dated back to legislation he presented in New York in 1777 to free all slaves in New York. In 1785 he founded the New-York Manumission Society. In 1799 Jay helped pass a bill entitled "An Act for the Gradual Prohibition of Slavery" which led to the eventual emancipation of all slaves in New York.</p><p>John Jay died on May 17, 1829.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The John Jay Papers cover a significant period of American History, from 1664-1820. The bulk of the papers are from Jay and his work as a statesman, foreign diplomat, and two-term governor of New York. There are a variety of materials from Jay including correspondence, dispatches, official documents, legal papers, and notes. Some of these materials are from significant projects or moments—the New York - New Jersey Line War, Jay's Treaty, Spanish and French negotiations, and<emph render="italic"> Federalist #64</emph>. The earlier material which pre-dates the American Revolution as well as Jay's birth seems to be from his relatives, both the Jay and Van Cortlandt families.</p><p>At some point, this collection was arranged and put on microfilm. Because of this, the arrangement was set prior to the creation of this finding aid. The series should be interpreted broadly as a means of encompassing as much as possible. There are descriptions of each series to highlight what may not be apparent from series and folder titles. </p><p>It should be noted that there are materials within this collection that, for whatever reason, are not on microfilm. Any material in the collection that does not appear on the microfilm can be easily identified because it does not have a reel number listed after the folder title.</p><p>All material that is on microfilm must be viewed in that format. For the materials that do appear on the microfilm, the reel number is included as well as the ordered number the original processer gave the information after the folder title.

It contains both manuscripts and correspondences. The manuscripts are an excerpt (the first six chapters) of a history of the American Revolution, written by David Ramsay (1749-1815), and a memoir. The correspondence includes official dispatches that were sent to and used by Jay during negotiations. There is also correspondence between Silas Deane, an early American politician involved with the Continental Congress and who was an envoy to France during this period, and Governor Jonathan Trumbull, Benjamin Talmadge, and J. Wadsworth. Trumbull has the unique distinction of being the governor of Connecticut both before and after the American Revolution, having been the only sitting governor to support the Revolution. Talmadge (also spelled Tallmadge) fought in the American Revolution and is known for having organized the Culper Spy Ring. He later served in the U.S. House of Representatives. Jeremiah Wadsworth served as commissary for the American Army during the Revolution, and was the wealthiest man in Connecticut after the American Revolution.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref13_u47" level="file"><did><unittitle>History of American Revolution (Reel 1- #1)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_6ddb5f164ad31fd3d5a617fcc8a4e1f1" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_5df33e5b1fd53e2dd1c21d93701db64f" parent="aspace_6ddb5f164ad31fd3d5a617fcc8a4e1f1" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref14_wk0" level="file"><did><unittitle>History of American Revolution (Reel 1 - #1)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_66dd4a21d0036057845d11d432db9c30" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_132527fee64b6e2848b2d28cad8d1128" parent="aspace_66dd4a21d0036057845d11d432db9c30" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref15_mkl" level="file"><did><unittitle>Instructions and Resolutions of Congress (Reel 1 - #2)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1779-1783</unitdate><container id="aspace_b8ffbbdecf63ceef51f46b3b5ba359ca" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_ced061ae881f01ca4856c0a5e43e441c" parent="aspace_b8ffbbdecf63ceef51f46b3b5ba359ca" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref16_ium" level="file"><did><unittitle>Official Dispatches and Other Papers Connected to the Negotiations in Spain and France (Reel 1 - #3)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1780-1783</unitdate><container id="aspace_d73383c0d38d0dfbd438a75b722f037a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_6b8e99e4747dab7c0fa2c63de0a29a7b" parent="aspace_d73383c0d38d0dfbd438a75b722f037a" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref17_762" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Independence of America Advantageous to France.

The treaty was meant to resolve remaining issues between the United States and Great Britain after the Treaty of Paris of 1783 which ended the Revolutionary War. Although the treaty was not universally popular within the United States and it did not resolve all the issues the negotiators had originally set out to fix, it did manage to keep the peace between the two countries until the War of 1812. Going beyond the treaty negotiations, there is a question written to Jay concerning boundaries that resulted from the treaty and Jay's answer. Also within this series is George Hammond's correspondence, which had been forwarded to Jay. Hammond was the first British envoy to the United States, serving from 1791-1795.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref21_wiz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Papers Connected with the British Treaty (Reel 2 - #7)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1794</unitdate><container id="aspace_274dea8f2672a707290782a8c41f9ad3" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container id="aspace_e3b80934f651f2fdf0c596c30a203315" parent="aspace_274dea8f2672a707290782a8c41f9ad3" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref22_ke9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interrogations to Him and Reply re St. Croix River, Etc. </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1798</unitdate><container id="aspace_fcb077ba98216be05b370984b9c5e495" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container id="aspace_5ee9783990e891f82bc3ff9178f786d6" parent="aspace_fcb077ba98216be05b370984b9c5e495" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref23_7l2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Papers Respecting British Spoilations and Interference with Indians, and the Correspondence with Mr. Hammond (Reel 1 - #8) </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1794</unitdate><container id="aspace_d134cf0121358afab5681f67d75ab4a8" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_e76ee94f3c85cc414e07b8761a487967" parent="aspace_d134cf0121358afab5681f67d75ab4a8" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref24_29g" level="file"><did><unittitle>Papers Respecting British Spoilations and Interference with Indians, and the Correspondence with Mr. Hammond (Reel 2 - #8) </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1794</unitdate><container id="aspace_5c793af37cc81f9b3528c65d13d52c76" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container id="aspace_58fafaae2a462245f0f560c87dfa990d" parent="aspace_5c793af37cc81f9b3528c65d13d52c76" type="Folder">4</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref25_yuu" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series III: Governing New York</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1796/1798" type="inclusive">1796-1798</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_481d2a324786e3d3c7cd9cc7c60c85c2"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>The materials within this series are from Jay's years as governor of New York.

Line War). This involved a series of skirmishes to determine the northern border of New Jersey, including a final skirmish in 1765 that was carried out with fists (not weapons because it was the Sabbath). In order to avoid further fighting, King George III appointed a royal commission in 1769 to determine once and for all what the border would be. Jay was a member of that commission. This series contains official documents, indentures, reports, surveys, drawings, and handwritten notes. There are also interrogatory answers from those from New York and New Jersey.This series is found on reel 3 and 4 of the microfilm.

There is correspondence from Jay as well as correspondence from his family. There are also ephemera items as well as a stay of execution from 1799 when Jay was governor of New York. Of particular interest is the draft of <emph render="italic"> Federalist #64</emph>. Along with Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, Jay wrote a number of essays meant to persuade Americans to adopt the Constitution. At the time, the essays were published under the name Publius. Before his death, Alexander Hamilton wrote a list out identifying the number essay with its author. He indicated that Jay had written #64. Later, Madison claimed to have written it. In 1863, Jay's grandson, another John Jay, was going through family belongings and found a draft of #64 tied up in old copies of the <emph render="italic"> Independent Journal</emph>, which was a newspaper in which the essays had originally been printed. Wanting to set the record straight, John Jay, grandson, sent the draft to the New-York Historical Society. The draft itself is now a part of the bound volume collection under BV Jay, John, but this series contains photostat copies of the draft.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref59_pxp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence from John Jay and the Jay Family (Reel 4 - # 1-10) </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1712-1823</unitdate><container id="aspace_d710da3ce6175021f972661aa7c4cbb3" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">8</container><container id="aspace_5e99df08cdcb2331fdb02075823006ea" parent="aspace_d710da3ce6175021f972661aa7c4cbb3" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref60_3ih" level="file"><did><unittitle>Notes Concerning <emph render="italic"> Federalist #64</emph> </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1863, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_f73b34a51ab589aea90a81daaa3df10a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">8</container><container id="aspace_d88cb403f2051d7a3095300e87d8d8ea" parent="aspace_f73b34a51ab589aea90a81daaa3df10a" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref61_vsn" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence, Official Documents, and Ephemera from John Jay </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1784-1799, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_6bf852700b66e14beb0e95013215a26d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">8</container><container id="aspace_f82e5755c91900038faccba32ca9c780" parent="aspace_6bf852700b66e14beb0e95013215a26d" type="Folder">3</container></did></c></c></dsc>
