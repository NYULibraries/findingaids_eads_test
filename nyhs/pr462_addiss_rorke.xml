    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>"This is the Army" was a World War II-era American musical (book by James McColl, music and lyrics by Irving Berlin) that was produced by the U.S. Army on Broadway over twelve weeks in the summer of 1942. During its run at the Broadway Theatre, the show—starring soldiers alongside professional performers and featuring such memorable tunes as "Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning"—raised $40,000 per week for the benefit of the Army Emergency Relief Fund. It next toured nationally and internationally, and in 1943 became a musical comedy film by the same title. In 1944–1945, under the auspices of the Special Services branch of the American military, the production traveled to Allied bases in Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific, bringing along much of the same cast to entertain troops stationed there. The final performance of "This is the Army" took place on Maui, Hawaii, on October 22, 1945.</p><p>Two men associated with the show—and long associated with each other—were Justus "Jus" Addiss (1917–1979) and Hayden Rorke (1910–1987). Addiss served as stage manager for the touring productions of "This is the Army." He went on to a career directing television programs such as "The Twilight Zone" and "Mr. Ed." Hayden Rorke (born William Henry Rorke) was a prolific actor who appeared in the Broadway run of "This is the Army," and made his screen debut (uncredited) in the film version. He is best remembered for playing Colonel Alfred Bellows in the 1960s sitcom "I Dream of Jeannie." Rorke and Addiss were romantic partners who lived together until the latter's death in 1979.</p>  </bioghist>

Jack Sydow Papers and Photographs (PR 289)</extref>. Sydow was an actor, director, and playwright who wrote and performed in several variety shows while in the military during World War II. His "Hump Happy," in which he starred with fellow service members, was the first such production to travel across combat areas, with productions at bases in Africa, India, and the Middle East.</p>  </relatedmaterial>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains 139 photographs by and of Justus "Jus" Addiss (1917–1979) and Hayden Rorke (1910–1987), taken during their time in the U.S. military during World War II, while they were touring with the Special Service Division in the Irving Berlin musical "This is the Army." Each print bears a handwritten or typed caption on the back, identifying the places and people appearing in the view. Locations include Italy (May-July 1944), Egypt (August 1944), the Holy Land (August 1944), Iran (October 1944), India (November 1944), and the Philippines (March and May, 1945). (Refer to the container list for more specific location information.)</p><p>While the musical production itself is not represented by photographs, the collection does include some views of the stage under construction and completed (taken in the Philippines; see Folder 8), and of the dressing room (taken in Persia [Iran]; see Folder 6). And, along with Addiss and Rorke—who is identified by "Bill," as his birth name was William—a number of other men appear in the photographs, most of whom were fellow servicemen and performers. Some are fully named; others are identified only by their first names or nicknames. Many are listed in the Broadway and film credits of "This is the Army":<lb/>
