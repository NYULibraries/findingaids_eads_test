      <p>The record group is organized in four series, three of which are restricted.</p>
      <p>Series I. Bequests to Circa 1960 (1852-1986)</p>
      <p>Series II. Bequests from Circa 1960-1982 (1927-1984)  RESTRICTED UNTIL 2032</p>

      <p>Series I is open to qualified researchers. The other three series, generally holding records from post-1960 transactions, are restricted.

      <head>Processing Information Note</head>
      <p>Most of the original files were processed over time, perhaps circa 1980-2000, with documents transferred from original folders to archival containers. In 2016, project archivist Larry Weimer integrated additional unprocessed material and created a detailed inventory, but the record group remained restricted at that time. In late 2017, Weimer and volunteer Alison Barr rearranged the content to facilitate opening Series I, which includes most of the files, to patrons.</p>

      <p>Though this bequests, gifts &amp; related matters record group (NYHS-RG 16) includes extensive and substantive content, there are several other record groups that include files concerning N-YHS acquisitions. These are as follows:</p>
      <p>The Collection Accession Registers (NYHS-RG 15) include lists of donations and purchases from the 1840s to 1962, though they can be inconsistent in their coverage and detail.</p>
      <p>The New-York Historical Society management committee records (NYHS-RG 1) includes minutes and so-called "official papers," both of which include reference to acquisitions.</p>
      <p>General Correspondence (NYHS-RG 2) includes acquisitions, among many other topics.</p>
      <p>The Museum Department Records (NYHS-RG 20) and Library Department Records (NYHS-RG 21) include acquisition records, principally for the twentieth century.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
      <p>The New-York Historical Society bequests, gifts &amp; related matters record group (NYHS-RG 16) primarily includes records concerning estates in which N-YHS was named as a beneficiary. Most of these instances resulted in N-YHS receiving museum objects, manuscripts, books, or other items or a financial legacy. In some instances, N-YHS was named as a residuary legatee or specified conditions needed to be met to receive the bequest. In yet other instances, N-YHS renounced the bequest.</p>
      <p>In addition to bequests, the series also includes records of some donations of objects and funds from donors during their lifetimes, as well as of items placed on deposit with N-YHS. Some purchases are also documented in the series. The files most commonly hold correspondence, wills and codicils or abstracts of same, Surrogate Court notices and filings, and receipts. Many files also hold inventories, appraisals, agreements related to purchases, deposits or other transactions, and other documents.</p>
      <p>The record group includes files on some of the major patrons and objects in N-YHS's history, including the Beekmans, Belknaps, Thomas J. Bryan, Crawford's sculpture <emph render="italic">The Indian</emph>, the Gallatin family, Cass Gilbert drawings, the Livingstons, Katharine Prentis Murphy, James Lenox's Nineveh sculptures, Katherine R. Rogers, the Thompson family, and many others. The container list includes a detailed inventory of the files.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
          <p>This series includes records of bequests and other gifts from 1852 to about 1960. Given that every file in the series represents a completely different matter and that the files span about 100 years of donations, the subject content of each file is noted in the container list. Many of the files include rich documentation including that for many acquisitions important in N-YHS's history, among them gifts and/or bequests from Thomas J. Bryan, Gerard Beekman (family coach), Waldron Phoenix Belknap, Jr. and his mother, Rey Hutchings Belknap, the Gallatin family, John Divine Jones, the Robert Livingston family, Pirie MacDonald, and Katharine Prentis Murphy and her brother, Edmund Astley Prentis. The series includes extensive documentation of the large financial legacy received from the Thompson family estate that was used to expand the Central Park West building and N-YHS's programs and staff in 1937-38. Among the major accessions documented in the series are Thomas Crawford's sculpture <emph render="italic">The Indian</emph> (from Frederic de Peyster), the drawings of architect Cass Gilbert, ancient Nineveh sculptures (from James Lenox), and bronze models by sculptor John Rogers (from his daughter, Katherine). The series includes some purchases, such as the Robert Bracklow photographs from Alexander Alland, portrait paintings from artist DeWitt Lockman, the Nadelman folk art collection, and Leonidas Westervelt's Jenny Lind collection.</p>
          <p>In addition to acquisitions from individuals, the series also holds files on some institutions that donated or deposited their records to N-YHS, or considered the possibility. Among these is the 1938 proposal, eventually declined, of the donation of the collections of the Marine Museum of the City of New York to N-YHS. Other institutions include, among others, the Naval History Society; the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the U.S., Commandery of the State of New York; the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States; and the Sons of Rhode Island in New York.</p>
          <p>Some files include subjects tangentially related to the bequest or gift itself. These include the exhibition of the Belknap Collection in 1950; the installations of the Prentis-Murphy Collection (1950s) and the Nadelman Folk Art Collection (circa 1940); the 1912 New York State court case concluding that N-YHS was an educational institution for the purpose of exemption from a transfer tax on bequests (De Peyster, C. Augusta file); the financial records for production of the first volume paid from the John Divine Jones Fund; and the successful effort to overturn the directive in the will of Augustus Van Horne Stuyvesant, Jr. to destroy much of his property. Generally the cut-off for this series is 1960, but there are later documents in the series that are included as they relate to the earlier transaction. </p>
