    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Video Group Records contain materials documenting Time Inc.'s work in the cable, film, and television industries. The Video Group oversaw the work of the departments and subsidiaries that worked directly in these industries. While each department overseen by the Video Group had separate staff and functions, much of their work overlapped, and employees moved between each department regularly. The materials within this record group mainly document the financial relationships and production efforts of each department. Additionally, the Morrie Roizman Files contain scripts and audio reels from the attempted relaunch of <title render="italic">March of Time</title>.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Processing Note</head>
<p>The Time Inc. Video Group Records were processed by Samantha Brown and Aleksandr Gelfand. Gelfand processed, described, and inventoried the Community Antenna Television/Sterling Communications Inc. Files in 2018. The rest of the materials were processed, described, and inventoried by Brown in 2018 and 2019. When present and in fair condition, the original folders were retained. Documents were transferred to archival containers in cases of overcrowding, if original folders were in bad shape, if unable to fit in original file sized folder or when in binders. Branded binders were separated from the binder contents for housing purposes; generic binders were not retained. Files retained their original titles, but files with illegible writing or unclear titles were either assigned new titles or had information added to them to clarify the contents. Series were created based on the original arrangement of the materials. If no order was present, such as with the Mel Baily Files on "Crusade in Europe", then an order was imposed.</p>  </processinfo>

Richard "Dick" Munro began his career with Time Inc. in 1957. After holding other titles, he was named deputy to the group vice president for television and films in 1972, becoming vice president of the group shortly after. In 1978, when the television and films group formally became the Video Group, Munro remained as vice president but left this position in 1980. During the time that Munro served as vice president, he oversaw a project involving Computer Television, also known as CTI, a Time Inc. subsidiary. This project was mainly focused on installing interactive television systems into hotel rooms. Munro and CTI worked closely with the Hilton Corporation to install and test this new system. While Munro left the Video Group, he remained with Time Inc. and became executive vice president of the organization. At the same time that Munro became executive vice president, he also joined Time Inc.'s board of directors. In 1982, Munro was promoted to board president and Time Inc.'s chief executive officer. After Time Inc.'s merger with Warner Communications, Munro maintained his position within Time Inc. but retired in 1990.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_e38f23db2d13e9b58a54f3abe06fcccd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Group Vice President of Television and Films J.

In 1974, he was promoted to chairman of HBO and remained in this position until 1980 when he left HBO to work as vice president of Time Inc.'s Video Group. Levin returned to HBO as chairman in 1982. While resuming his previous position at HBO, he did not leave the Video Group and remained the group vice president. Between 1982 and 1983, Levin continued to serve as HBO chairman and Video Group vice president but left both of these positions in 1984 when he joined Time Inc.'s board of directors and became vice president of strategic planning at the corporate level.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>Lewis, Mark.

While Levin mainly served as Video Group vice president during this period, he also served as Home Box Office (HBO) chairman from 1974 to 1979 and 1982 to 1983.

He remains in this position until 1981 when he leaves HBO to work as executive general counsel for the Video Group. While Gross continues to work with the Video Group in 1982, he changes positions and becomes president of video development. At this time, he also becomes chairman of the board of Teletext, a Time Inc. subsidiary. While Gross's duties seem to focus on development of the Video Group, the department head lists for 1982 still refer to him as general counsel. In 1983, Gross's title changes and he becomes the Video Group's president of video development and information services. He remains as Teletext's board chairman. After 1984, Gross no longer appears on any Time Inc. department head lists.</p><p>Citation:</p><p>Personnel and Organization: Department Head Lists. Time Inc.

Gabriel Perle began working at Time Inc. in 1964 as an assistant to the editorial counsel at the corporate level. By 1966, Perle was promoted publishing counsel within the corporate group. Perle remained in this position until at least 1972 when he was listed in the department head list as one of two members of the legal department under Charles Bear, the vice president and secretary of administration and international affairs within the corporate group. In 1974, Perle was still working within the corporate group but in the legal department under the group vice president and secretary Charles Bear. While still being at the corporate level, Perle oversaw the legal affairs for various groups within Time Inc. that did not have their own dedicated legal counsel. One such group was the Video Group. Within Perle's own files, he is referred to as the publishing and legal counsel for the Video Group. Perle remained in this position until 1980 when a dedicated legal department is set up at the corporate level. At this point, Perle became vice president of law and the head of the legal department. Perle remained with Time Inc. until 1984 when he no longer appears in department head lists. </p><p>Citation:</p><p>Personnel and Organization: Department Head Lists. Time Inc.

The materials in this subseries focus Home Box Office's (HBO) finances as well as early promotional efforts for the new cable television channel. While the majority of materials come from the period that Levin was chairman of HBO's board, there are a few items from the time that Levin was vice president of the Video group. Since the majority of materials are related to his time as HBO chair, the materials have been included in the HBO series. Included in this subseries are cassette tapes, Home Box Office (HBO) channel guides and newsletters, production rate cards, ad drafts, press releases, satellite network maps, clippings, issues of <title render="italic">American Way</title> magazine, press kits, preliminary budgets, notes, agreements, staff lists, project proposals, meeting agendas, cable television industry convention guides and pamphlets, Sterling Manhattan television maps, Sterling Communications annual and shareholders reports, employee manuals, re-estimates, two-year and five-year plans, executive meeting summaries, sales volume budgets, cable television booklets, NCTA (National Cable and Telecommunications Association) convention daily magazine and newsletter, <title render="italic">VUE</title> magazines, CATV directories, reports, and correspondence. The reports included discuss the status of projects, subscription sales, task force meetings, budgets, the impact of new rules and regulations, new business acquisitions, Video Group planning conferences, and consumer cable choices. The correspondence discusses budget plans, travel plans, video group performance, via cable work, 5-year plans, Home Box Office (HBO) status updates, lunch meeting agenda, news channel concepts, and HBO News. HBO News was a proposed project that would either be a new cable channel or news show that would broadcast news to HBO subscribers.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

While the company was created at that time, Time-Life Films doesn't become a fully subsidiary of Time Inc. until December 1969 when Time-Life Films purchases the Peter M. Robeck and Company. Peter Robeck, the former owner of Peter M. Robeck and Company, is appointed as the managing director of Time-Life Films. This new subsidiary handles the sales of distribution of films within the United States with a focus on distributing materials created by the British Broadcasting Company (BBC). </p><p>At the time that Time-Life Films purchased Peter M. Robeck and Company, it began working on television productions. Initially, these television productions were considered to part of the non-theatric division of the subsidiary. While Time-Life Films had divisions internally, the different sections of the organization weren't listed in department head lists until 1974. Internally, Time-Life Films names its divisions education, video, and non-theatric divisions but on department head lists the divisions are production, marketing, and business affairs. The divisions named on the department head lists appear to have been administrative in nature and to have overseen the work done by the internal division. The department head lists do not begin to reflect the group's internal organization until 1978 when the Television Division is listed for the first time.</p><p>Over the course of Time-Life Films existence, the Television Division had a variety of names. Between 1972 and 1974, the division is called the Non-Theatric Division then, partially through 1974, the name is changed to the Television Division. This name is kept until at least November 1978 when the name changes to the Television Distribution Division. This name is in use until 1981 when the Television Division is reinstated. After 1982, Time-Life Films appears sporadically in department head lists. </p><p>Citations:</p><p>Personnel and Organization: Department Head Lists. Time Inc.

It is unclear who created and used these files since a number of different names appear on documents. Some of the most common names found in these files were Micheal Garin, Peter Hansen, Mary Miller, Rick Schilling, Bill Miller, Haidee Granger, Clare Simpson, Sarah Frank, and Rosemarie DiSapio. At the time that these files were created, Garin appears to have been the vice president and general manager of syndicated and public television. The others worked on public television projects. Included in this subseries are production schedules, project pitches, grant proposals, reports on technology standards, Shakespeare task force reports, invoices, clippings, comments on casting, show summaries, production notes, show introductions, market analysis reports, contracts and agreements, notes, materials and activity reports, list of support activities, project updates, study materials proposals, committee meeting transcripts, Q and A forms, floppy disks, project overview statements, assets and liabilities statements, project flow charts, cross-collaterization analysis, reports on British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) and Time-Life Films relationships, trip preparation lists, budget analysis, projected budget, production cost sheet, scripts, and correspondence. The correspondence discuss deliveries, multimedia, status reports, trips, requests for information, project updates, exhibits, broadcasts, travel, contract changes, use rights, agreements, dubbing, recording, distribution, production, technology/equipment, finances, co-productions, authorization, and acquisitions.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

Diary</title> series. An array of Time-Life Television staff also worked on the production of the series and appear in the files. The focus of this subseries is on the recording, mixing, and editing work that went into creating and producing the <title render="italic">G.I. Diary</title> series as well as the casting process. Included in this subsubseries are notes, clippings, actor information and contact sheets, character break downs, commercial and promotion scripts, audition scripts, pilot scripts, music cue sheets, recording notes, episode synopses,  citizen review panel reports, interview guidelines, expense reports, daily production and editing schedules, audition schedules, travel  itineraries, program budget reports, lists of consultants, lists of editing rooms, television broadcast schedules, film delivery schedules, production progress reports, research summaries, and correspondence. The correspondence discuss audience responses to the show, audience demographics, scripts, voice over recordings, travel, title card edits, contact information, requests for film and stills, staff lists, job responsibilities, USO and Christmas shows, schedules, and consultants. Especially interesting are the daily schedules, which outline meetings the production staff needed to attend and production deadlines, and the audition scripts which provide details about who was being considered for doing voice over for the series.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e5842621409ed2d646ae389f581f2771"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged

The bulk of the materials cover the period of 1977 to 1979. While it is unclear who these files belong to, Janis Klein, a producer for the series, and Beverly Smith, an associate producer for the series, were both involved in placing ads for veteran stories in military magazines and publications. It is unclear if they were also receiving and reviewing the letters as well. This subsubseries mainly contains correspondence from military veterans describing their experiences in World War II. The titles of the folders reflect the titles that the veterans or Time-Life Films Television staff assigned to the stories. There is a limited amount of other materials including clippings, notes, veteran response sheets, enlistment and separation forms from the United States military, and copies service member diaries.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_a1a8aa55a3b857bb8debfb3e9f65d29b"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c

The first evidence of its existence is in a January 1978 department head lists which includes a consumer video group within the special projects division of Time-Life Films. By November 1978, consumer video is moved to the developmental projects division. In 1979, the developmental projects division is gone and replaced by the video enterprise division. The following year, the division is called the video division. By 1981, Time-Life Films only appears sporadically in department heads list. At around the same time, a new subsidiary appears in the lists called Time-Life Video. It is unclear if Time-Life Video grew out of the Video Division of Time-Life Films or if it was a wholly new creation. </p><p>Citation:</p><p>Personnel and Organization: Department Head Lists.

The service was officially launched in 1979 as the Time-Life Video Club. At the time the service officially launched, the Video Division decided to follow the model used by the Book-of-the-Month Club, another subsidiary of Time Inc., and only distribute pre-recorded content. The content offered included feature films, dramas, comedies, children's' shows, sports, and how-to's. Much of the advertising and launch campaign for this service was handled by the Book-of-the-Month Club. </p><p>After the service's launch, the Time-Life Video Club was faced with a variety of problems. One of the main issues was that the service could not secure the rights to enough lucrative films. Without these titles, the Time-Life Video Club was not able to promote the service in the way that they had originally planned leading to unfavorable sales. Due to these issues, Time Inc. sold the Video Club to Vestron Inc. in 1981.</p><p>Citation:</p><p>Time-Life Films: Time-Life Video Club: 1978-1981. Time Inc.

The following year, the division is no longer listed and appears to have been absorbed by the Video Enterprise Division. While department head lists offer little information, the materials within this series imply that the division existed before 1978. The main purpose of this division was to create educational kits that could be used in classrooms.</p><p>

The focus of this series is on the production of educational kits that Time-Life films distributed and sold to schools and universities. Included in this subseries are clippings, bibliographies, teaching guides, drafts of guides, notes, episode overviews, sound scripts, overdue transparencies forms, cue sheets, film lists, shooting masters, filmstrip reports, frame lists, scripts, personnel lists, photograph order forms, invoices, project overviews, story boards, catalog listings, program guides, agreements, and correspondence. The Correspondence discuss comments on scripts, production of films, filmstrips, transparencies, payments, photographs, scripts, language levels, content issues, agreements, and reproduction. Additionally, there are two multimedia kits that are examples of the materials that were distributed and sold to schools and universities.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

With the launch of this new project, Time-Life Films created a special projects division which would handle projects that were outside its normal purview. While initially launched with just <title render="italic">Wild, Wild World of Animals</title> in mind, the television books department of the special projects division ended up creating books for a number of Time-Life Films shows. Since Time-Life Films was not set up to publish books, it worked with Time-Life Books on these projects. The television book staff were responsible to creating the actual content of the books while Time-Life Books staff were responsible for printing and publishing the books. </p><p>

The majority of materials dated earlier than 1970 are photocopies of materials used for research. The focus of this subseries is on the research and production of <title render="italic">Life Goes to War</title> and mainly includes photocopies of materials used for research and chapter drafts. When the files were transferred to the archive, they were identified as copy files from the Time-Life Books editor Charles Osborne. The records themselves do not indicate if he worked with them. Many of the documents appear to have  initials written on them but it is unclear who the initials belong to. The name that appears most frequently is David Scherman who was an editor working on <title render="italic">Life Goes to War</title>.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_58c05927d9a4a9b9f9398a7818b4352e"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged by chapter.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_2aac6627d5d776b0e73ff12b39daabd2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chapter 1</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1977, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_47355b23c8202b97fb7a662a060468a9" label="Mixed Materials [10170000011454]" type="Offsite-Box">3407</container><container parent="aspace_47355b23c8202b97fb7a662a060468a9" type="Folder">1-3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_df50e8446ab3562153b89e1fb1554905" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chapter 1: Allied Enemy Prep</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_8d31ba85aac8937078acc9d322d6222a" label="Mixed Materials [10170000011454]" type="Offsite-Box">3407</container><container parent="aspace_8d31ba85aac8937078acc9d322d6222a" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_9a60d380c093c45c1f3d3cb6f2e17913" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chapter 1: Appeasement Politics</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1937-1939, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_faee5d471a13e893ff8b585addf84877" label="Mixed Materials [10170000011454]" type="Offsite-Box">3407</container><container parent="aspace_faee5d471a13e893ff8b585addf84877" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_39f4208032633c36219b6443fb9a045a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chapter 1: Bloodless Conquest</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_262bb9396f5b19c734f53b31d9abe5ff" label="Mixed Materials [10170000011454]" type="Offsite-Box">3407</container><container parent="aspace_262bb9396f5b19c734f53b31d9abe5ff" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_3bb42defdc89cfc7c1e3eb5031e606ac" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chapter 1: Chamberlain and Conquest Stalin</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1935-1941, 1962</unitdate><container id="aspace_0fd1a44b1ee4068d469fe9bc2bbfa841" label="Mixed Materials [10170000011454]" type="Offsite-Box">3407</container><container parent="aspace_0fd1a44b1ee4068d469fe9bc2bbfa841" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_4dfe9a259f7b1d46900d95397c164797" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chapter 1: China</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1937-1941, 1966, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_c4561c681b2bae329842c11c0fb97cf6" label="Mixed Materials [10170000011454]" type="Offsite-Box">3407</container><container parent="aspace_c4561c681b2bae329842c11c0fb97cf6" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_5c67e1fe960f14d3365e627a960a2f1a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chapter 1: China: Mao-Chiang</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_36474d7a4f769a745043d88d8e180707" label="Mixed Materials [10170000011454]" type="Offsite-Box">3407</container><container parent="aspace_36474d7a4f769a745043d88d8e180707" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_54cc6f84f364aa65a2ef9f472739cd19" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chapter 1: China: Newsreel Wong, Natori.

The majority of materials dated earlier than 1976 are photocopies of materials used for research. The focus of this subseries is on the production of <title render="italic">Wild, Wild World of Animals</title>. The materials in this series are mainly chapter drafts, chapter corrections, masters, corrected blues, consultant changes, and correspondence from the scientific consultants William P. Mull, Richard Zwefel and Robert Shallenberger. It is unclear who these files belong to. When the files were transferred to the archive, they were identified as copy files with little additional information. The files themselves do not indicate who they belong to. Time Inc. staff who contributed to these records include production editor Joan Chambers, Deborah Heineman from Time-Life Television and Eleanor Belingham.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

While documents discussing the creation of a video service exist as early as 1970, it is unclear if this was a separate organization within Time Inc. or if it they were discussing the video division of Time-Life Films since many of the staff mentioned as part of Time-Life Video were staff of Time-Life Films. Time-Life Video isn't listed as a separate group with Time Inc. until June 1981. Based on evidence found with this record group, it appears that Time-Life Video was made into a separate organization as Time-Life Films was being phased out. As part of this phase out, Time-Life Video took on many of the projects that Time-Life Films had been working on. </p><p>Citation:</p><p>Personnel and Organization: Department Head Lists. Time Inc.

While the majority of documents were created by staff within Time-Life Video, there are also materials from Time-Life Films.

In 1980, Granger is promoted to vice president and general manager of public television within the television distribution division of Time-Life Films. Granger remains in this position until June 1981 when Time-Life Video is established. Within Time-Life Video, Granger is appointed vice president of co-productions. In July 1982, Granger takes on additional responsibilities. Along with being the vice president of co-productions for Time-Life Video, she also become executive producer of the magazine group with the Video Group. By December, Granger is once again just the vice president of co-productions. Granger remains in this position through 1984. After this point, she does not appear on department head lists anymore.</p><p>Citation:</p><p>Personnel and Organization: Department Head Lists. Time Inc.

When Granger switched from Time-Life Films to Time-Life Video, it appears like she brought much of her previous work over with her. Since the majority of materials are from the period that Granger worked for Time-Life Video, the materials are part of the Time-Life Videos series. Included in this subseries are production evaluations, project proposals, post production scripts, commentary scripts, press releases, clippings, invoices, project budgets, copyright registration forms, background research, notes, slides, photographs, show programs, playbills, scripts, financial reports, five-year plans, contract preparation orders, contract abstracts, music cue sheet, episode overviews, provisional filming schedules, co-production summary sheets, distribution forms, agreements and contracts, list of contracts, list of corporations, resumes, cast lists, ratings list, candidate lists, invoices, committee remarks, negatives, event schedules, press kits, promotional materials, magazine issues, program overview, and correspondence. The correspondence included in this series discuss production, payments, cash flow, licensing, agreements, revenue, delivery schedule, cash advances, finances, sales, agreements and contract, invoices, production updates, credit changes, funding, closed captioning, television schedules, music cues, approval processes, responses to shows and critiques, changes to shows, film deliveries, underwriting pitches, requests for funds, and shipments.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_daae7768b3991486f81ce022842b05ff"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged

While there are documents from her time as the manager of accounting for the Video Group, the majority of documents do not focus on that work. Additionally, there are some materials that originate from Time-Life Films, these documents are present since Time-Life Video took over many of Time-Life Film's responsibilities when it was phased out. Included in this subseries are agreements, notes, distribution forms, contract overview forms, co-production forms, license agreements overviews, clearance history sheets, re-run analysis, list of air dates, financial analysis, lists of shows and revenue, list of payments, rights evaluations, distribution reports, sales history reports, notes, invoices, check requisition forms, list of contracts, bookkeeping journal entries, financial reports, list of receipts, contract abstracts, profit and loss worksheets, profit participation formula sheets, and correspondence. The correspondence discusses cable sales candidates, agreements, delivery schedule, and costs.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

These documents are present since Time-Life Video took over many of Time-Life Film's responsibilities when it was phased out. Included in this subseries are a list of requests for extension of rights, invoices, list of outstanding invoices, contract abstracts, distribution forms, notes, BBC residual obligations report, payment history sheet, residual calculations report, currency rates sheet, assets and liability analysis, syndication analysis, cash flow stats, revenue status report, and correspondence. The correspondence discusses clearance notices, residuals, payments, licensing, sales, and equity agreements.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

It is unclear why one is listed as a group within Time Inc. while the other is listed as a subsidiary.</p><p>Time-Life Broadcasting was originally created in 1961 and was incorporated in 1962. At the time the organization was formed, their main interest was in exploring and research community antenna television systems, also known as CATV. By building this antenna system, they hoped that homes that were too far from broadcasting stations might be able to receive television reception and this wider network would allow them to build a pay-tv system in the future. To make this effort a reality, Time-Life Broadcast purchased Sterling Information Services in 1965. </p><p>Along with purchasing the systems needed to broadcast television, Time-Life Broadcast also bought local television stations, such as WTCN-TV-AM in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Owning television stations allowed Time-Life Broadcast to broaden the scope of their efforts and create their own programming. Not only did they have the means to broadcast television but now they could create, produce, and sell their own product. One notable project that Time-Life Broadcast tried to market was a relaunch of <title render="italic">March of Time</title> featuring Henry Cabot Lodge. </p><p>

Sterling, under the leadership of its founder, Charles F. Dolan, was the first company to enter the cable field in New York City in 1962 when it began wiring hotels throughout Manhattan to broadcast informational programming. In 1965 Sterling Information Services, Ltd received a franchise to provide CATV in Manhattan from 86th Street on the East side and 79th Street on the West side all the way to the Battery under its Sterling Manhattan Cable Television (SMCTV) subsidiary.</p><p>During its years of operation Sterling secured the rights to broadcast New York Knicks basketball and New York Rangers home games on SMCTV and established Home Box Office (HBO) pay channel in 1972. In 1973 Time Inc. took over Sterling Communications, Inc., dissolving the company and selling most of its assets. Two of Sterling's subsidiaries, HBO and SMCTV, became wholly owned subsidiaries of Time, Inc. and were placed under the Time-Life Cable Communications unit. SMCTV was subsequently renamed Manhattan Cable Television (MCTV).</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_05a55693243a932951ff2ad89d882e94"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The subseries consists of records dealing with Sterling Communications, Inc. and its various subsidiaries during their years of operation (roughly from 1965-1973), liquidation and disposal of Sterling assets after the company was taken over by Time Inc. in 1973, and the management of Manhattan Cable Television (MCTV) and Home Box Office (HBO) as wholly owned subsidiaries of Time Inc.
