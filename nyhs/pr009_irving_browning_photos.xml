    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Irving Browning (1895-1961), a self-taught photographer and cinematographer, was born in New York City. Browning opened a commercial photograph studio at 110 West 40th Street in 1922 or 1923; his younger brother, Sam, occasionally worked with him as a photographer. A former silent film actor and comedian of the 1910s, New Yorker Irving Browning photographed both exteriors and interiors of skyscrapers, art deco theaters, hotels, apartment buildings, and suburban residences, and documented the lifestyles of New Yorkers during the 1920s and 1930s.</p><p>The Irving Browning Studio received commissions from architectural firms, advertising agencies, and magazines to photographically illustrate both the realistic and idealistic urban environment of Depression-era New York City. As construction in Manhattan flourished despite the Depression, Browning was hired to document such new architectural landmarks as the Chrysler Building, the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the RKO Roxy and Earl Carroll theaters, and the towering Empire State Building.</p><p>Through both his professional and personal work, Browning also captured some of the more intimate daily experiences of city residents. Many of his photographs from the 1930s meditate on the contrasts of poverty and wealth; they focus on poor Lower East Side peddlers, former businessmen selling apples in the aftermath of the stock market crash, and shantytowns as well as on such things as well-heeled shoppers perusing fashionable window displays and the leisure activities and lifestyles of the wealthy.</p><p>Browning was an innovator who took an avid interest in the technical aspects of photography. His correspondence hints at his interest in the evolution of color film, in advances in motion picture technologies, and in expanding the ability of still photographs to communicate. Browning's creative and sometimes frenetic photomontages were popular among magazine advertising clients. His novel circular reflection, bas-relief, and expansive architectural views graced the pages of The New York Times. Browning's technical interests also extended to the history of photography and cinematography. He amassed a large collection of vintage cameras, projectors, lenses, stereoscopic viewers, and motion picture equipment. Browning lectured on and exhibited his collection at colleges, schools, and professional organizations throughout the New York area.</p><p>In later years, Browning focused his career on creating motion pictures. He worked in a variety of capacities in the film industry, from his early work as an actor to his later work in the 1930s and 1940s as a director, producer, and cameraman. A few of his short films gained a measure of notice, including the documentary <title type="simple" render="italic">City of Contrasts</title> (1931), and the short biopic <title type="simple" render="italic">Women in Photography</title> (1941) which focused on the careers of Ruth Alexander Nichols, Toni Frissel, Bernice Abbott, and Margaret Bourke-White. </p><p>Browning was a member of a number of professional organizations, including the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, the American Television Society, and the Master Photo Dealers' &amp; Finishers' Association. His photographs were exhibited jointly with such well-regarded contemporaries as Margaret Bourke-White, Ralph Steiner, and Bernice Abbott. By 1940, Browning had founded and was serving as president of the Camera Mart, Inc., a photographic and motion picture equipment store which he owned until his death in 1961.</p>  </bioghist>

Photographs are arranged alphabetically into the following subject-based subseries: Advertising; Aircraft and Aeronautics; Apartment Buildings; Banks and Financial Institutions; Browning, Irving; Chinatown; Churchs and Synagogues; Construction and Construction Workers; Depression, the Great; Eagles; Factories and Industry; Harbor and Waterfront Views; Hospitals; Hotels; Lower East Side; Monuments and Statues; Night Views; Occupations; Office Buildings; Parks and Squares; Photomontages; Police Stations; Portraits; Public Buildings and Institutions; Rain Views; Residences; Restaurants; Roofs and Roof Gardens; Ships, Boats and Ferries; Shoes; Shops and Shopping; Skylines and Cityscapes; Sports and Recreation; Streets and Avenues; Television and Radio; Theaters; Tourists; Transportation; Utilities; Winter Views; and Miscellaneous/Unidentified. This series contains architectural photographs taken for clients, such as construction progress photographs of art-deco theaters and skyscrapers, as well as more documentary photographs that portray with a touching grace the lives of New Yorkers during the Great Depression. Browning's photographs depict the city in an era that began with a prosperous postwar economy, struggled through the Depression, and ended in the second World War; they document both the glamorous and the destitute environments that existed simultaneously in the city during this era.</p><p>Most photographs have been briefly labeled and bear one or more of several Irving Browning studio stamps; some photographs also have "Browning" and a negative number printed into the photograph. It is unclear which of the photographs may have been taken by Sam Browning or other photographers in Browning's employ; all credits refer to "Irving Browning" or the "Studio of Irving Browning." The majority of the photographs bear no dates. Approximate dates for buildings in this finding aid were researched during processing and are generally related to dates of building construction as established by the American Institute of Architects in the AIA Guide to New York City, 4th edition (New York: Three Rivers Press, 2000). Photographs in this collection bear only very brief descriptions on the verso or no description at all; descriptions listed in this finding aid were generally assigned or expanded by N-YHS staff and are not titles assigned by the Browning Studio.</p><p>Two boxes at the end of the collection contain duplicate vintage prints of photographs from Series I which are being held in reserve.</p></scopecontent><altformavail id="aspace_7a8734b5096cd3bdbaa92a70da0230d5"><head>Existence and Location of Copies</head><p>Digital copies are available in the <emph render="bold"><extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://digitalcollections.nyhistory.org/islandora/object/nyhs%3Abrowning">Shelby White and Leon Levy Digital Library</extref>.</emph></p></altformavail><c id="aspace_ref14_xwb" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Advertising</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ce02a7a7ff370a5cc7a53cb1b6746bf7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Advertising subseries primarily focuses on billboards and other large signs, many of which were taken around the Times Square area.

1920s and the 1930s, such as the Earl Carroll and the RKO Roxy Theatre. A heavy focus on interiors, and especially art-deco design elements, is evident. Also included are some views of burlesque and less legitimate venues, such as the Salon des Arts. Several theaters in this subseries were heavily documented by Browning, probably working on commission; some construction progress views are included.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref396_h8m" level="item"><did><unittitle>Ambassador Theatre, interiors (2)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_15dab08725155afa63a106944c954453" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">20</container><container parent="aspace_15dab08725155afa63a106944c954453" type="Folder">200</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref397_wpa" level="item"><did><unittitle>Astor Theatre, marquee for <title render="italic">Eskimo</title> and <title render="italic">New Moon</title></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1933</unitdate><container id="aspace_d4bfa95411648b856aa43275cc9e1d18" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">20</container><container parent="aspace_d4bfa95411648b856aa43275cc9e1d18" type="Folder">200</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref398_r0u" level="item"><did><unittitle>Avon Theatre, interior, detail of controls</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_2d262f6fa9b6f73fda2fff62e5c96564" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">20</container><container parent="aspace_2d262f6fa9b6f73fda2fff62e5c96564" type="Folder">200</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref399_81j" level="item"><did><unittitle>Beacon Theatre, interiors and exteriors</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_bc3152e83a8ecc91ecf2b4b14af6108f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">20</container><container parent="aspace_bc3152e83a8ecc91ecf2b4b14af6108f" type="Folder">201</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref400_r18" level="item"><did><unittitle>Biltmore Theatre, interiors (2)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_e6f2781053a28c3170d7a3eb92b3ca6e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">20</container><container parent="aspace_e6f2781053a28c3170d7a3eb92b3ca6e" type="Folder">201</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref401_riu" level="item"><did><unittitle>Brooklyn Paramount Theatre, interiors (5)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_27b03f31f3b8e3123dff46a1778444f4" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">20</container><container parent="aspace_27b03f31f3b8e3123dff46a1778444f4" type="Folder">201</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref402_jne" level="item"><did><unittitle>Carlton Theatre, interiors and exteriors (Brooklyn) (8)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_5416640d48e04c08b579835aefeaa19d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">20</container><container parent="aspace_5416640d48e04c08b579835aefeaa19d" type="Folder">202</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref403_84w" level="item"><did><unittitle>Cameo Theatre, ticket booth and entrance</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_fc4c3fae53eca75fc574bc41faa862d2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">20</container><container parent="aspace_fc4c3fae53eca75fc574bc41faa862d2" type="Folder">202</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref404_0ad" level="item"><did><unittitle>Century Theatre and view of Central Park West at 61st St.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[1925]</unitdate><container id="aspace_6ae589177ad78bad1b406f65f11c7a93" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">20</container><container parent="aspace_6ae589177ad78bad1b406f65f11c7a93" type="Folder">202</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref405_fmu" level="item"><did><unittitle>Criterion Theatre, actor Neil Hamilton and others in entrance</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_b2cf81b614a1cd0987ee2818d8c8afe2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">20</container><container parent="aspace_b2cf81b614a1cd0987ee2818d8c8afe2" type="Folder">202</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref406_nlp" level="item"><did><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_d0660b66d3cf0bf4d941640bfbda5923" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">20</container><container parent="aspace_d0660b66d3cf0bf4d941640bfbda5923" type="Folder">203</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref407_7w0" level="item"><did><unittitle>Earl Carroll Theatre, interiors and exteriors -
