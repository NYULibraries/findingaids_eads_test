<p>The collection is housed in ten boxes. Boxes 1 through 9 are arranged chronologically by date of letter, or, when that is lacking, by date of postmark. Letters from select correspondents, which span several years, are grouped into distinct folders, and are filed after the general correspondence for their initial year. For example, the letters from Albert Gallatin, which span 1834-1844 (Box 2, Folder 7), follow the general correspondence for 1834 July-December (Box 2, Folder 6).</p><p>Box 10 includes correspondence that is undated and grouped by recipient (Folder 1, family), place (Folders 2-4, Maine, Massachusetts, and Europe), or by correspondent (Folders 5-6, arranged alphabetically). Undated letters and loose covers from unidentified correspondents are in Folder 7.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>In his long career <emph render="bold">George Folsom</emph> (1802-1869) adopted varied, interchangeable, and occasionally overlapping roles, among them attorney, historian, author, librarian, antiquarian, politician, diplomat, and ethnologist. He was a member (and sometime officer) of the American Antiquarian Society, New-York Historical Society, Maine Historical Society, Vermont Historical Society, American Geographical and Statistical Society, Athenaeum Association, Century Association, Union League Club, and American Ethnological Society, of which he was president for the last decade of his life. Most notably, he sat in the New York State Senate (1845-1847), and served as chargé d'affaires (the diplomatic official who heads an embassy in the absence of an ambassador) to the Netherlands (1850-1853).</p>    <chronlist>
