    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The New York City 100 (1997-2000) was a nonprofit institution created as a public-private collaboration whose mission was to plan and coordinate commemoration of the centennial of the creation of "Greater New York"  -- the consolidation of forty municipalities, including the separate cities of Brooklyn and New York, on January 1, 1898.  (This merger insured New York's place as America's largest city and, in the world, second only to London.  The city's size tripled, to 320 square miles, and its population doubled to 3.4 million.)</p>    <chronlist>

The first (Box 7, Folder 3) provides students from elementary through high school with New York City historical content to complement their social studies and history curricula, focusing on the development of research skills.  The second (Box 7, Folder 5) contains maps, charts and tables, time lines, photographs and a wealth of primary and secondary sources to be used by teachers of all grades.  Its primary subject is immigration and it is subdivided into segments such as "Leaving Home", " The Journey", "Preserving Cultural Identity", "Assimilation", and "Next Generations." In addition to copies of the manuals, this series contains correspondence (Box 7, Folder 4) that includes thank you letters from both the Mayor and the Deputy Mayor.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref160_c9e" level="file"><did><unittitle>a. <title render="italic">New York City 100 Teachers' Resource Manual</title>, September 1998</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1998/1998" type="inclusive">1998</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_bccea8df731596feea10d24951f3e05e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_bccea8df731596feea10d24951f3e05e" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref161_13z" level="file"><did><unittitle>b.
