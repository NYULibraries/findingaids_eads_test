    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The New-York Historical Society Pictorial Archive (NYHS-RG 5) primarily includes images of N-YHS's buildings, galleries and other interior spaces, exhibitions, collection objects, programs, and people, such as trustees, officers, and staff. The bulk of the images date roughly from the early 1900s into the 1970s, though there are images from earlier and later periods. Most of the record group includes black and white photographic prints, but there are also negatives, color slides, and some color prints. There are also a relatively small number of non-photographic formats, including drawings, posters, and architectural plans for building renovations after 1965. </p><p>Many of the photographic prints found in the record group have a control number noted on the back; this number corresponds to negatives, many of which are still extant and found in Series XI. The envelopes holding the negatives often include descriptive information that goes beyond that found with the print.</p><p>There are many highlights in the record group. The Buildings series includes rich sets of photographs documenting the construction of the Central Park West building in the early 1900s and the major expansion of 1937-1938. There are many photographs of galleries, the library, and other spaces in both the Central Park West building and N-YHS's earlier home on 2nd Avenue and 11th Street. The Exhibitions series includes installation and related object and publicity photographs. Photographs for exhibitions and programs also include the opening receptions and other events held at N-YHS, such as the annual Strawberry and St. Nicholas festivals, Eleanor Roosevelt attending the 1952 <emph render="italic">Votes for Women</emph> exhibition, and noted clown Emmett Kelly attending the 1968 exhibition <emph render="italic">Circus Posters from the Days of the Big Top</emph>. The Staff Events and Trustees, Officers and Staff series provide glimpses of some of the people from N-YHS over the years. </p>  </scopecontent>

<p><emph render="bold">History of N-YHS:</emph></p><p><emph render="italic">"For without the aid of historic records and authentic documents, history would be nothing more than a well-combined series of ingenious conjectures and amusing fables."</emph>
From an 1805 address of the New-York Historical Society</p><p>The New-York Historical Society is New York's oldest museum.  At the time of the Society's founding in 1804, only 75,000 people lived in New York City, Alexander Hamilton had just been killed in a duel with Aaron Burr, and New York still spelled its name with a hyphen (thus the hyphen in the museum's name).  On November 20, 1804, merchant John Pintard met with ten other New Yorkers to create an organization that would, according to its Constitution, "collect and preserve whatever may relate to the natural, civil, or ecclesiastical History of the United States in general and of this State in particular." This was a broad mission statement but since there were very few museums at the time, and only one other historical society in the nation, the founders decided it was imperative to collect an inclusive range of materials before they were lost. </p><p>The first meetings of the Society were held rent free in City Hall because New York City's mayor, DeWitt Clinton, was a founding member.  The Society's library grew significantly in 1809 when Pintard sold his own book and manuscript collection to the New-York Historical Society.  As the library and museum continued to grow, its members soon realized that it needed a home.  Unable to find a permanent space, the Society moved five times between 1809 and 1857, until it was able to construct its own building on Second Avenue and Eleventh Street.  </p><p>In the mid-19th century, the Society's membership increased along with its library and art collections.  Between 1858-1867, the Society acquired the collection of the New York Gallery of Fine Arts, the Abbott collection of Egyptian Artifacts (now at the Brooklyn Museum), and 433 watercolor paintings of John James Audubon.  Soon the art and the library were competing for space and it became apparent that the Society had once again outgrown its home.  In 1908, N-YHS moved into a newly constructed building at its present location at 77th Street and Central Park West. Renovations in the 1930's added two new wings and a fifteen-story stack area to the building.  Today, the museum and library continue to provide access to collections relating to the political, legal, cultural, mercantile, and social history of the United States and New York in particular. </p><p>For more detailed history see:
Vail, R.W.G. <emph render="italic">Knickerbocker birthday : a sesqui-centennial history of the New York Historical Society, 1804-1954</emph>.  New York : New York Historical Society, 1954.</p><p><emph render="bold">Administrative History of the Pictorial Archive</emph></p><p>The specific source of the pictorial archive is uncertain, but the bulk of it appears to have been  compiled from various sources, mostly N-YHS in-house photographers, but also outside sources. The archive was likely compiled by the staff of N-YHS's Department of Prints, Photographs and Architectural Collections, known as the Print Room. The pictorial archive as it existed in 1998 was documented in Helena Zinkham <emph render="italic">A Guide to Print, Photograph, Architecture &amp; Ephemera Collections</emph>; it is recorded as PR 46 at page 114. </p><p>Since 1998, the Pictorial Archive was transferred into N-YHS's institutional archive, and assigned a new call number (NYHS-RG 5). Although the core content of the Pictorial Archive appears to have remained consistent over recent decades, the arrangement and description of the content has changed somewhat over time. Also, additional material has continued to be integrated into the Pictorial Archive, while some material, especially architectural plans and Field Exploration Committee negatives, have been moved to other record groups within N-YHS's institutional archive. Going forward from 2015, the Pictorial Archive is expected to continue to accrue additional images, but not in a centralized manner as in the past. Most images collected in the future are expected to be archived with their department or other such contextual records.</p>  </bioghist>

The user should be aware that the box and folder numbers associated  with certain images on flickr may no longer be precisely accurate because of additional processing done in 2015 with the photographs.</p><p>A large number of deteriorating  negatives documenting the 1937-1938 expansion and renovation of Central Park West were digitized in 2015 by Eleanor Gillers.

    <head>Processing Information Note</head>
<p>Until the early 2000s, the Pictorial Archive was maintained  as a Print Room collection (PR). In the early 2000s, it was transferred to the institutional archive.  Many of the photographic prints were processed by Maurita Baldock in 2005. In 2007, Project Archivist Celia Hartmann integrated a substantial amount of additional prints and made some changes and additions to the organization of the material. In 2015, Project Archivist Larry Weimer added a new series for the related negatives from the Print Room files, removed architectural plans into two new record groups (NYHS-RG 3 and NYHS-RG 4), integrated additional prints, and made other, minor changes to the arrangement and description.</p>  </processinfo>

The images primarily include specific objects used in the exhibitions and installation views. There are some images of opening receptions and other events tied to the exhibition. The content is uneven across the series as some exhibitions are heavily represented with images, while others, especially in the earliest years, include fewer images, sometimes only signage. Most of the images are undated and unidentified and so are associated with particular exhibitions often only through their folder labeling, which has been retained as found.</p><p>The bulk of the images in the series are black and white photographic prints. Some of the files also include other formats, especially negatives and color slides, which are noted at the folder level. Some of the files also include press releases, captions, and other such textual matter. The series includes some non-photographic pictorial matter, including exhibition publicity posters.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_b69e3176bb2ecb17a60e7448fe479bd6"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The Exhibitions series is arranged chronologically and by title of the exhibition. References to months in the date range are to the exhibition opening. Some folders include material from more than one exhibition. A few folders of material related to exhibitions installed in venues other than the N-YHS building are at the end of the series, as are folders of oversize posters.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref46_0ba" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annex 2 (4 West 77th St.) Exhibitions: Ships &amp; Steamboats; Old New York	</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1932/1933" type="inclusive">1932-1933</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_1a27d3df73b5e9269b4780d55b451502" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">5</container><container parent="aspace_1a27d3df73b5e9269b4780d55b451502" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref47_581" level="file"><did><unittitle>N-YHS 135th Anniversary		</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1939</unitdate><container id="aspace_c9daffc5cbe3ddf55c2bbed4f55fe7b0" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">5</container><container parent="aspace_c9daffc5cbe3ddf55c2bbed4f55fe7b0" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref48_wgx" level="file"><did><unittitle>John Paul Jones; Presidential Campaigns; Emma Thursby Memorial

These events included N-YHS's Strawberry Festival, an annual springtime affair for members, and the St. Nicholas Festival, a longtime tradition of jointly celebrating the December holiday from a Netherlands and New Netherlands perspective and N-YHS's anniversary. Other events include presentations of donated objects, N-YHS's sesquicentennial anniversary dinner and reception; commercial photo shoots using N-YHS galleries and objects as backdrop; medal awards; and the History Maker's Gala fundraisers of the 1980s, among others. The series also holds a small number of posters, signage, and other such graphic materials related to N-YHS sponsored events.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1110_xlp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Print of and identification key to <emph render="italic">Distinguished Americans at a Meeting of N-YHS in the Chapel of the New York University Building at Washington Square</emph></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1854</unitdate><container id="aspace_203d3bac5798c030aa0949b9efff2760" label="Graphic Materials" type="drawer">12A-B10</container><container parent="aspace_203d3bac5798c030aa0949b9efff2760" type="Folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fde1176107701103e4760046da3b015d"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>See also: two copies of "Meeting of the New-York Historical Society in the Chapel of New York University," a print by To.

It also likely includes some images for which there are not prints. Images  include those of exhibitions, buildings (interior and exterior), programs and events, objects, and staff. Formats are both glass and film of various sizes (8x10, 5x7, 4x5, and 35 mm strips). Further information on the subject matter of negatives and the approximate number of related negatives for each subject is included in the container list below. Each negative  is  individually enclosed in an envelope that often  includes descriptive information that is not always noted on the prints , such as date, event, and names of people in the image.</p><p>Negatives included in this series are only those that were held in the N-YHS Print Room's negative files. Other negatives were found in some of the folders of prints and were left in those folders; see the above series descriptions for those negatives.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e4240e88a4a08b2dcc305e15a1fad884"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>For conservation purposes, the negatives were arranged and housed in boxes by format and by size. Glass slides are boxed separately from film. Within each format, 8x10, 5x7, and 4x5 size envelopes are boxed  separately. Generally, the envelope size corresponds with the size of the negative, but some envelopes hold smaller negatives. Most notably, the small 35 mm strips are held in 8x10 sheets/envelopes. </p><p>Each negative (or 35 mm roll) has a unique control number, which is noted on the envelope housing the negative. Within each box, the negatives are arranged in control number order. This number was often written on the back of a related print thereby linking the print and negative. Accordingly, to facilitate finding a particular negative regardless of format or size, the container list is arranged in control number order. Each entry in the container list indicates a range of control numbers, the format and size of the negatives common to the range (which also indicates the size of the box they are in), and the box number in which the negative will be found. </p><p>There is not necessarily a negative for every control number in the ranges shown in the container list. Gaps are very common because of the designation of a control number to a negative other than one in the institutional archive, lost or destroyed negatives, or other reason. Because of the gaps, there is often a sharp discrepancy between the actual number of negatives and the number implied by the range. To correct for this, each entry in the container list includes a note concerning the subject matter of the negatives in the range with a parenthetical indicator of the approximate number of actual negatives, for example: "Exhibitions: Early American Toys (4)."</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_e7325b5524f67b8745e578fc70adda19"><head>Processing Information Note</head><p>The negatives were arranged and housed in boxes by conservation intern Sara Belasco in 2015.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_ref743_0kj" level="file"><did><unittitle>Negative #14.
