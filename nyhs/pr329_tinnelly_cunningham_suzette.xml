    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>Toni "Suzette" Cimino was a floral designer whose clients included the restaurant Le Cirque, which appears in various photographs of this collection. Cimino lived in the studio apartments that existed, until 2010, above Carnegie Hall. Among the other artists living in these apartments was Bill Cunningham, a fashion photographer for the New York Times from 1978 until his death in 2016. Cunningham and Cimino were close friends and she was a frequent subject of his photographs, predominantly so in this collection. Cunningham's involvement with the fashion world extended back at least to the 1950s and to his career as a fashion designer, particularly of women's hats. By the early 1960s, his focus had shifted from designing to writing and to photography. Originally from Boston, he arrived to stay in New York City and the Carnegie Hall apartments in the early 1950s. Among the visitors to Cimino's apartment was her young niece, Melanie Tinnelly, the future donor of this collection to N-YHS, who met Bill Cunningham there and remained close to him and her Aunt Toni for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Sources: <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> obituary of Bill Cunningham on June 25, 2016; Wikipedia entry for Cunningham; Cunningham's <emph render="italic">Times</emph> article "Bill on Bill" of October 27, 2002; and a blog entry by Tinnelly reminiscing about Cimino and Cunningham on <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://aleteia.org/2017/05/08/bill-cunningham-famous-fashion-photographer-more-than-a-great-talent/">aleteia.org</extref>.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The Melanie Tinnelly collection primarily includes photographs taken by fashion journalist and photographer Bill Cunningham. The photographs principally center on a close friend of Cunningham's, Toni Cimino, known as Suzette. The photographs feature Suzette on the streets of New York City, by brownstones, in Christmas-themed holiday markets, in the snow, at a flower market, and the like. Cimino commonly appears alone in the photographs, but also with other people. A few of the photographs are captioned as having been taken in the apartments above Carnegie Hall where Cimino, Cunningham, the photographer Editta Sherman, and others lived. Most of the collection includes Cimino in the images and so her presence is not noted at the folder level notes below; to the extent other identified people are found in the folder, that is noted.</p><p>In addition to the photographs of Cimino, but also sometimes overlapping, are Cunningham's photographs of interior spaces at Le Cirque restaurant and elsewhere, often with flowers or floral arrangements as prominent features. Most of the photographs are black and white, but there are many in color also. </p><p>Many of the photographs are dated and have identifying locations or identifications of the other people in the image. Several photographs are captioned or inscribed by Cunningham, at times as profound expressions of affection and friendship sent with the photograph to Cimino. There are a small number of greeting cards from Cunningham that hold similar expressions of fondness. </p><p>In addition to Cunningham's photographs, there are several by other photographers, including Tinnelly. Tinnelly's photographs, printed on oversize paper, are of Cunningham and/or Cimino from late in their lives. A set of three photographs of Cimino are by Antonio Lopez.  One notable artwork in the collection is a collage that includes a photograph of Cimino taken by Cunningham with a border drawing by Ruben Toledo. Nonetheless, most of the photographs in the collection not taken by Cunningham are by unidentified photographers. These photographs include snapshots of Cunningham and others at various celebratory events and social settings, ranging from the 1970s to the 2000s. </p>  </scopecontent>
