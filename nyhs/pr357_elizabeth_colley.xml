    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>Photographer Elizabeth Keegin Colley and her husband, David P. Colley, often worked together as a photographer/writer team. In the early 2000s, they responded to a request for proposals from the Prospect Park Alliance for a history of the park. With the winning proposal, the Colleys set to work on what would be published as <emph render="italic">Prospect Park: Olmsted &amp; Vaux's Brooklyn Masterpiece</emph> (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2013). The images in this collection were included, along with many others, in the book. </p><p>(For further information, see the Brownstoner's 2013 <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://www.brownstoner.com/brooklyn-life/the-hot-seat-david-p-colley-and-elizabeth-keegin-colley/">on-line interview</extref> with the Colleys.)</p>  </bioghist>
