Falk family papers include correspondence, financial ledgers, diaries, photographs, print matter,  artifacts, and film pricipally related to Falk, a New York City based engineer, and his immediate family, and to a lesser extent to his wife Milly's family, the Einsteins . Myron Falk (1878-1945) worked as a consulting and chief engineer for the New York State Water Supply Commission and multiple construction and manufacturing companies. He was also on the Board of Directors or an officer of various institutions, including Wonham, Bates, and Goode Trading Corp. and Mt. Sinai Hospital. Additionally, Falk was Vice President at the American Bemberg Corporation, and served as a Lieutenant during World War I and World War II in the Ordnance Department building ammunition plants. For his work, Falk traveled often, going to Cuba, Brazil, and the Mediterranean, as well as China, Japan, and Korea with the American Silk Mission in 1923, during which he wrote detailed correspondence to his children.</abstract>

Nonetheless, if materials of various formats or subjects were found together in envelopes or folders, the archivist did not sort them into various series, but left them together. Therefore, although the series may appear rigid, the subject matter can be found in various parts of the collection. Accordingly, it is recommended that researchers look through all the series to ensure they have identified all relevant materials.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>Myron S. Falk was born in New York City on 13 September 1878. His parents were Arnold Falk (1843-1891) and Fannie Falk (1856-1920). Falk graduated as a Civil Engineer from Columbia University in 1899, and as a Mechanical Engineer from Stevens Institute in 1900. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1904. He spent ten years at Columbia teaching in the Civil Engineering Department, where he wrote text books on the design of bridges with Professor of Civil Engineering, William A. Burr. While teaching, Falk was made head of the Testing Laboratory which resulted in his book "Cements, Mortars and Concretes." In 1904 he was appointed a member of the New York Bay Pollution Commission by Governor Benjamin B. Odell to investigate the pollution of New York Harbor. In 1905 he was appointed Consulting Engineer to the New York State Water Supply Commission, which had control and supervision of all water supplies in the state, including New York City. In 1905, he became Chief Engineer of the Godwin Construction Company. Two years later he became Chief Engineer of H.H. Oddie Inc, a New York construction firm. At the same time, he formed an association with Albert B. Hager, Civil Engineer, with whom he designed many steel building frames for architects. </p><p>In 1917 Falk was appointed Major in the Ordnance Department of the Army and was in charge of the production of raw materials for the Ammunition Division during World War I. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel before his retirement in July 1919. He became Chairman of the Board of Directors of Wonham, Bates &amp; Goode Trading Corporation in 1920, which was a branch of M. Samuel &amp; Co. Ltd, of London, an importing and exporting firm for whom he made trips to China, Japan, Brazil, Cuba, etc. In 1923, he traveled with the American Silk Mission to China, Japan, and Korea to discuss silk trade. He resigned his position at Wonham in 1927 to become Vice President and Chief Engineer of the American Bemberg Corporation, for which he built a large plant for the manufacture of rayon at Johnson City, Tennessee. He was also Consulting Engineer to many other projects, such as the construction of the Temple Emanu-El at 65th Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City. He also served as an officer and director of the Mercury Theatre.</p><p>Falk retired from all active work in 1928 but in 1941, in the months leading to America's entry into World War II, he returned to the Ordnance Department as Consulting Engineer to the Ammunition Division. Based primarily in Washington, Falk was a special assistant to the chief of the division on matters concerning the construction and operation of about seventy powder, explosives and loading plants. In late 1942, Falk was commissioned into the Army and assigned to the St. Louis Ammunition Branch as Head Engineer, before transferring in 1943 to the New York District as Principal Engineer of Industrial Production.</p><p>Falk was also associated with various organizations, some referencing his Jewish heritage, such as the Hebrew Technical Institute, the Institute for the Deaf, the Home for Aged and Infirm Hebrews, chairman of the Lavanburg Foundation, and trustee and chairman of the Building and Laboratory Committees of Mt. Sinai Hospital. He was in Harmonie Club, Engineers Club, Columbia University Club, and the Army-Navy Club. </p><p>In 1903, Falk married Milly Judith Einstein (1883-1915) whose father was Henry L. Einstein, a wool manufacturer and owner of <emph render="italic">New York Press</emph>. The Falks had two daughters, Eleanor and Mildred, and a son, Myron Falk Jr., who was known as "Johnny." Falk purchased in 1913 Tophill Farm on King Street in Greenwich, Conn.; the property is commonly referred to in the documents as being in Port Chester, N.Y., which was the closest town center/train station. After Falk's death in 1945, the property was sold to the Thermix Corporation as their new headquarters. It was in the vicinity of what is now the Brunswick School's pre-and lower schools.</p><p>[This biography was drawn primarily from biographical notes found within the collection, and a <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> obituary.]</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The Myron S. Falk papers include documents related to the personal and professional life of Myron S. Falk (1878-1945), an engineer from New York City. The collection spans from 1867-1947, although the bulk of the collection dates from the 20th century, after Falk graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Columbia University (1899) and Mechanical Engineering degree from Stevens Institute of Technology (1900).</p><p>Falk's professional career is represented in this collection through his published works on engineering and his correspondence with companies he worked for, such as H.H. Oddie Inc, the American Bemberg Corporation, and the trading company Wonham, Bates, and Goode, for whom he would often travel.</p><p>A significant portion of travel correspondence, ephemera, and photographs derives from his journey in 1923 to China, Japan, and Korea with the American Silk Mission, which met with and discussed trade with silk manufacturers.</p><p>Additionally, there is an abundance of financial and legal documents regarding Falk and his family, including wills, estate and trust accounts, tax documents, ledgers, appraisals of his homes, and general financial correspondence and bills, some of which touch upon his involvement with Mercury Theatre.</p><p>There is also a scrapbook that contains information that commemorates important events involving Falk and his family, such as Columbia University Class of 1899 memorabilia, World War I and World War II clippings, clippings on their home Tophill Farm, and his children's wedding invitations and graduation pamphlets.</p><p>Also included in the collection is correspondence from Falk's time in the Ordnance Department during World War I and World War II, where he worked designing and manufacturing ammunition plants. Correspondence and artifacts also represent the numerous associations he was involved in, such as the Harmonie Club, the Society of American Magicians, Mt. Sinai Hospital committees, and Congregation Emanu-El. There is also a significant amount of condolence notes from when Falk died in 1945.</p><p>The collection also holds an assortment of photographs of his family and travels, some of which are in photo albums with captions or indexes, and others are loose with little identifying information.</p><p>Also in the collection are reels of film. Many of these were taken by Falk on his travels during the 1920s and later and many are home movies of his family. Several of the reels are from the years after Falk's death and were taken by Myron Falk, Jr. The family had many of these digitized and the digital files are on a USB and a set of DVDs.</p>  </scopecontent>

Falk's travels, much of which was done for the company Wonham, Bates &amp; Goode for whom he was Chairman of the Board of Directors. Most documents are dated 1923 or after, excluding one travel diary written by Falk at 10 years old in 1888. There is also a diary that dates 1910-1934, in which Falk details some of the trips he went on, which also have material within this series. A set of snapshots from 1910-11 depict Myron and Milly on travels to Europe (primaily Italy) and to the Caribbean and Panama where they saw construction underway on the canal.</p><p>A significant amount of material in this series was obtained in his journeys with the American Silk Mission, which was a group of businessmen who traveled around East Asia visiting silk manufacturers and factories in order to discuss the silk trade. Included are newspaper clippings from regional newspapers in Asia that welcomed the Silk Mission and give context to their travels, as well as itineraries and ephemera from each factory visited. There are also many photographs, some taken by Falk, which are more candid and also larger, posed ones given to him by the factories. Of particular significance is the detailed correspondence of his journeys through China, Japan, and Korea through which he not only details his daily travels, but also comments on cultural customs of these countries through a Western perspective. Korea was occupied by Japan during this period and the impact of that occupation is noted at times by Falk. Also within this correspondence is a description of a brief meeting with Sun Yat Sen, the first provisional President of the Republic of China. </p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_5dcd7c3346114c3876b460ca875edb8d"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>This series is arranged in chronological order.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref39_df6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Travel diaries </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1888, 1910-1934</unitdate><container id="aspace_f530e87b92a0920df7b07678511564e8" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020123]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_f530e87b92a0920df7b07678511564e8" type="Folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_101f3ce2e7435aed12ce79b07c746328"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes two diaries.

Falk's travels to the Middle East, Egypt, Europe, Panama, Brazil, Caribbean, and Western United States are included, but there do not appear to be any images from the American Silk Mission or other Asian travel. Falk's films also include images of home and family in Greenwich, Connecticut (commonly referred to in the collection as Port Chester, New York) and elsewhere. Some moving images were made by Myron Falk Jr. (Johnny), including European travel in the 1930s and later family images. Much of the film was digitized by the family and digital copies were included with the collection and in the series.</p><p>During processing, the film was not viewed. Subject content noted in the container list was derived from the various labeling found on the reels and their canisters. Various labels appear to have been added over time and the container list notes their references, to the extent they could be read. All but a few reels included a reference number and a "new" number; both numbers are included in the container list. </p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e2217d1cd17e32316d2c35cef4336fd8"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The series is arranged, with minor adjustment, as presented to N-YHS by the donor. Film related to "travel" opens the series and is found in boxes 9 and 10.

During processing at N-YHS, the film reels were rehoused into archival containers. The tin storage containers were discarded, however, the tins that housed the individual reels were retained as they have information written on them. Reels that were loose in the collection (i.e., not stored in one of the four tins) are also in Box 10.
