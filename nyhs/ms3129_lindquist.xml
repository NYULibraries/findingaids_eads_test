Lindquist participated in the Second Battle of the Somme (France) and the Battle of Lys (Flanders). The collection includes his dog tag and service medals.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Eric Gustave Lindquist (1891–1966) was born to Swedish immigrant parents in New York City on April 30, 1891. While employed at the New York Workmen's Compensation Rating Bureau, Lindquist, along with several colleagues, was induced by a coworker who was a member of the National Guard to join Company K of the 71st Infantry, New York. Lindquist enlisted on August 17, 1915. The 71st was stationed at McAllen, Texas, during the so-called Border War, the series of skirmishes between U.S. troops and Mexican revolutionaries. Lindquist was promoted to corporal on August 10, 1916, and to sergeant on September 1, 1917. On October 14, 1917 he enlisted in Company K, 105th Infantry, which was soon absorbed into the 27th Infantry Division of the Army National Guard. Lindquist transferred to the 102nd Engineers of the 27th on December 6, 1917, and remained with regiment until his discharge on April 3, 1919. For his service in France (May 1918–February 1919), and participation in the Battle of Lys (April 1918) and Second Battle of the Somme (August-September 1918), Lindquist received the World War I Victory Medal. He died, age 75, in Bronxville, Westchester County, New York, on December 2, 1966, ten years after retiring from the management of the 42nd Street office of the Royal-Globe Insurance Companies. [See Lindquist's brief obituary in the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, Sunday, December 4, 1966, page 88.]</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Arranged and described by archivist Joseph Ditta, March-April 2019. The Eric G. Lindquist Papers came to the New-York Historical Society in three overstuffed, deteriorating post binders, which have been discarded. Two binders held Lindquist's "Written and Pictorial Diary" (now filed in Box 1, Folders 4-6, and Box 2, Folders 1-3), and the third binder held his typescript memoir (now filed in Box 2, Folders 4-5).</p>  </processinfo>

<p>See the <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/ms3068_sharman/">William Sharman Papers, 1916–1965 (MS 3068)</extref>, a small collection documenting the military service of native New Yorker William Sharman (1894–1978). Like Eric G. Lindquist, Sharman served with the 71st New York Infantry, National Guard, in Texas, during the 1916–17 border skirmishes spawned by the Mexican Revolution. Sharman subsequently enlisted in the 106th Regiment Field Artillery, United States Army, 27th Infantry Division, and saw action in France during World War I. Sharman actually appears in at least five photographs in Lindquist's "Written and Pictorial Diary" (see box 1, folder 4, preceding page 21, and following page 22).</p>  </relatedmaterial>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of two main parts: </p><p>[A] "Written and Pictorial Diary / Service Prior to and During / World War / With / 71st New York Infantry / 105th Infantry / 102nd Engineers / 27th Division, U.S.A. / Eric G. Lindquist 1915-1919."</p><p>[B] An untitled, undated, typescript memoir.</p><p>In the "Written and Pictorial Diary" [A], Lindquist has interspersed pages of calligraphic text with captioned photographs of himself, fellow servicemen, officers, camps, and equipment, taken while stationed at McAllen, Texas, during the border skirmishes of the Mexican Revolution; at Camp Wadsworth, Spartanburg, South Carolina, before shipping to Europe; and in various locations throughout Belgium, France, and England during World War I.</p><p>Tipped inside the "Written and Pictorial Diary" were two newspaper clippings (dated 1960 and 1961), a scrapbook page of sewn-on service medals and Lindquist's dog tag, and his pocket diary for 1918 (originally a printed diary for 1916, Lindquist filled it two years later). For ease of access, these items are now filed separately but retain their original position at the front of the diary proper. (See the container list descriptions for Box 1, Folders 1–3.)</p><p>Lindquist's typescript memoir [B], which runs to 502 pages, is based on his "Written and Pictorial Diary" of 1915-1919, and his pocket diary of 1918, which he describes in the "Forward" [sic] as "a tiny book of not more than three inches in length containing a record of the most minute incidents. The writing was accomplished with a delicate pencil of no greater weight than a slender reed." Indeed, the minuscule script requires magnification to be legible. (See Box 1, Folder 3.)</p><p>The memoir runs to 24 chapters with titles like "First Call to Arms" (chapter 2), "Nights of Hell at Mount Scherpenberg" (chapter 15), and "A Colonel Goes Berserk" (chapter 22). It includes two hand-drawn maps signed "E.G.L": "The Mount Kemmel Battle Area" (Box 2, Folder 5, following page 351), and "Hindenburg Line at St. Quentin Canal Tunnel" (Box 2, Folder 5, following page 393).</p>  </scopecontent>
