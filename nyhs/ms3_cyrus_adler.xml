    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Cyrus Adler was born in Brooklyn in 1927, and for many years taught oceanography, physics, and math at City College of New York, Long Island University, and other educational institutions.   A long time resident of  Manhattan's upper west side, Adler has since the 1950's been very involved in community and political organizations. He played a leading role in the West 97th/98th Street Block Association and their efforts to transform a defunct restroom into a community and information center.  In addition, Adler was active in many New York-based democratic polical organizations, such as the Riverside Democrats and the Stevensonian Democratic Club..  Adler also played a role in various transporation initiatives in the 1970's and 1980's, advocating for  projects like the Westway Highway Tunnel and Central Park Toll Tunnel to move vehicular traffic underground and create more park space for the public. </p><p>In 1982, Adler founded Shorewalkers, Inc., a not-for-profit organization founded to promote greater access to New York's waterfront, encourage shore walking, and advance preservation and enhancement of metropolitan shorelines. At the time, large portions of the New York-New Jersey shoreline were inaccessible and/or lined with trash and rubble.  As the urban shipping industry declined, abandoned piers were inhabited by homeless people and drug dealers. By organizing hikes and excursions along waterfront areas throughout the metropolitan region, Shorewalkers helped spur their transformation into parks and greenways. In particular, their efforts contributed to the creation of the Hudson River Greenway, the 11-mile route from Battery Park to the George Washington Bridge. Adler has written several books, and numerous articles and reviews.</p>  </bioghist>

Adler served as President and coordinator of the Association during the 1970s and 1980s, and he and other members converted an abandonded comfort station into a neighborhood safety and information center called the West Flank Safety and Information Center (WFSIC). When completed, the community center provided area residents a first aid station and recreation center, and ultimately helped revitalize the community by reducing crime. Several letters from Adler discuss the challenges in working with the Broadway Mall Association (BMA) to transform the comfort station into the information center.

The bulk of the materials pertain to the Westway Highway Tunnel Project during the 1970s and 1980s. Developed by Governor Rockefeller's Urban Development Corp., the Westway Plan gained support after a section of the West Side Highway (WSH) collapsed in 1973. This massive project called for new landfill to extend 1,000 feet into the river, a sunken two-tiered highway, parks, and new real estate development.  Many New Yorkers supported this plan, including Adler, who argued that this new highway would be used by trucks and cars, eliminate pollution, transform the waterfront, and act as a catalyst for the redevelopment of the West Side. The Westway received approval from both city and the Federal government, but the proposal was rejected in 1985 due to environmental issues. The various documents included in this series capture both the supporting and opposing viewpoints of the project and what led to its demise.  </p><p>Among the various organizations that Mr. Adler was involved with to promote the Westway Highway was the Scientists' Committee for Public Information, Inc. (SCPI). Founded in 1958, SCPI was an organization of scientists, physicians, and engineers whose purpose was to objectively evaluate technical issues of a project that would allow the public to make informed decisions. The SCPI's Transportation subcommittee acted as coordinator for several teams of experts who examined the various subsections of the West Side Highway Project Environmental Impact Statement. Also included are materials on two subsequent proposals to restore the West Side Highway: the Route 9A Reconstruction Project and the Miller Highway Project.</p><p>There is also a small amount of material on Adler's efforts to improve bus service and the Central Park Toll Tunnel.  </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref299_k80" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries III.1: Westway Tunnel Project</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref132_6ga" level="file"><did><unittitle>Westway Fact Book</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1977</unitdate><container id="aspace_c4bd11378e47ae820cea07db478bc241" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020282]" type="Offsite-Box">5</container><container parent="aspace_c4bd11378e47ae820cea07db478bc241" type="Folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_193ea9867e516cf648b76eea0019bd33"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>This booklet contains a comprehensive background and chronology of the Westway Project.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref160_4o2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Council on the Environment</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1974</unitdate><container id="aspace_f6fb362172da0a16d24e18ea59b2dfff" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020282]" type="Offsite-Box">5</container><container parent="aspace_f6fb362172da0a16d24e18ea59b2dfff" type="Folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b9bc0d156f43e5ad38b88096bcd1141f"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>This folder contains several environmental fact sheets and reports, many if which are annotated.

Shorewalkers' mission is to explore, enhance, enjoy, and protect the parks, promenades, and paths along the waters in and around the greater New York metropolitan region. Shorewalkers' first hike took place Sunday, December 12, 1982 along the west coast of Manhattan. Their announcement read: "Explore the changing Hudson River Coast, Battery Park, the Westway Route, active piers, through Penn-Central railroad yards and into Riverside Park. Lunch stop in Harlem. Wilderness above the George Washington Bridge, wind up in an Irish pub in Inwood." They ventured along Manhattan's waterfront at a time when the Manhattan waterfront greenway was not a accessible as it is today. Since 1982, thousands of people have explored the New York, Newark, and Jamaica Bays; the Hudson, Bronx, Hackensack, and Passaic Rivers; the Gowanus, Newtown, and other inlets; the Croton Aqueduct; the Long Island Sound, and Atlantic Ocean among other waterways. Among their most well known walks are The Great Saunter, an annual all day hike along Manhattan's 32-mile shoreline, and the annual Walk off the Turkey (WOTT), a post-Thanksgiving Day hike.  
 
Shorewalkers' continues to promote the Hudson River Shore Trail, a 56-mile trail along the Hudson River up through New York state ending at Bear Mountain, known as the "Batt to Bear Trail." The Shorewalkers' efforts to preserve the Hudson River shoreline contributed to the creation of the Waterfront Greenway enjoyed by New Yorker's today. Among the organization's many supporters was the folk singer Pete Seeger, who wrote the lyrics for the Shorewalkers' Saunter.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_2e15dfcaf907ac8c29a18e6f7c616cc4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains Adler's administrative files for Shorewalkers, Inc.

Each envelope is numbered; Adler used a numbering system that appears to be based on the year and month the photos were taken.  Photographs are arranged chronologically using Adler's numbering system, rather than by subject.  </p><p>For preservation purposes, photos and negatives have been removed from their orginal envelopes and are housed separately in acid-free envelopes. Photographs are boxed separately from negatives. Some of the negatives in the collection were not printed, so researchers should consult both photograph and negative boxes for a complete set of images. </p><p>There are also two folders of negatives from the 1990's that are separately housed in Box 10 because of their size. Box 10 also includes one folder of contact sheets from the 1990's.  Each of these retains Adler's original number so that they can be correlated with any related photographic prints and the original enevelopes in which they were housed.</p><p>The original envelopes have also been retained, and are housed in boxes 15-17.  These envelopes contain handwritten notes and should be consulted for additional contextual information about the images.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref324_y4b"
