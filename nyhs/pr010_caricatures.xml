The caricatures range from the late colonial period in British North America to the mid-twentieth century, with just a few outliers from before and after that range. The bulk of the collection, with about 1300 items, dates from the Jacksonian era beginning in 1828 to the close of the 19th century. Political matters are especially well-represented in the collection, especially in connection with the electoral politics of Presidential campaigns. Economic policies (e.g., banking, currency, financial speculation, tariff reform, growth of industrial power, etc.) is a major theme. African-Americans appear frequently in the images, either as principal subjects or in the background as a subtext to the often layered caricatures of the 19th century. Slavery, abolition and the perceived ability (or inability) of emancipated African-Americans to participate as equals in American society are common subjects in this regard. Other subjects that run through the collection are political corruption (especially in relation to Tammany), America's relation with the rest of the world, social issues, and America at war.</abstract>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At some point in the mid-late twentieth century, the collection was compiled by N-YHS library staff and physically organized and foldered in flat files in a chronological order based on the known or estimated date of the object. Likely at the same time, each item was given a unique identifier composed of the object's year and sequence number (e.g., 1848-1, 1848-2, etc.). That number is written on the back of the item. Each item was documented in a card catalog, which remains available in the N-YHS Reading Room. Some items, perhaps added to the collection at a later time, do not have a unique identifier, though these typically do have a catalog card entry. These unique identifiers and the overall filing scheme remain in place and were used as the foundation of this finding aid's inventory.</p><p>By 1994, it appears that at least some of the caricatures had been inventoried in a "Print Room Database." A print-out of the items from that database is also available in the Reading Room, but it only includes items to 1845. A new identifier was assigned to the items in this database, but that identifier seems to be unused outside of this one incomplete print-out and so was not used in this finding aid.</p><p>Beginning in 2019 and, after interruption by the Covid-19 pandemic, concluding in 2022, volunteer Alison Barr prepared the item level inventory for this finding aid. The primary source for the item descriptions here is the card catalog, from which Barr transcribed key fields (e.g., title, creator, medium). Barr also referred to the 1994 database print-out for items to 1845 and she added any key descriptive data points (such as accession dates) she observed on the item itself that was not recorded on the card catalog. This approach yielded a reconciliation between the card catalog and the items in the folder; consequently some items in the card catalog were identified as missing from the folders (and are noted as such in the finding aid) and some items were found in the folders that were not card cataloged. In the interest of time, not all annotations on a document or data on the catalog card were transcribed for this finding aid; such exclusions included references to research sources, N-YHS photo ID numbers, and other data points considered to be secondary. Barr's work was reviewed by archivist Larry Weimer, who added some bracketed subject terms at points as well as the notes and overall structuring of the finding aid. </p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection holds about 1600 prints (mostly engravings and lithographs) and pen and ink drawings of humorous and caustic pictorial commentary on political events and social customs. The publication of single-sheet caricatures blossomed in the mid-1700s, and such individually issued prints comprise the bulk of the collection, which also include drawings for editorial cartoons published in newspapers. The caricatures range from the late colonial period in British North America to the mid-twentieth century, with just a few outliers from before and after that range. The bulk of the collection, with about 1300 items, dates from the Jacksonian era beginning in 1828 to the close of the 19th century. </p><p>Political matters are especially well-represented in the collection, especially in connection with the electoral politics of Presidential campaigns. Economic policies (e.g., banking, currency, financial speculation, tariff reform, growth of industrial power, etc.) is a major theme, both within the context of presidential elections and as a general theme in the development of the nation. Political corruption is often caricatured, and New York City's Democratic Party (referred to commonly as Tammany, after its headquarters, Tammany Hall) is often the chief target.</p><p>African-Americans appear frequently in the images, either as principal subjects or in the background as a subtext to the often layered caricatures of the 19th century. Slavery, abolition and the perceived ability (or inability) of emancipated African-Americans to participate as equals in American society are common subjects in this regard, and commonly drawn with racist imagery, such as in the 1828 "Life in Philadelphia" series and the "Darktown" series of the 1880s drawn by Thomas Worth, James Cameron, and others and published by Currier &amp; Ives.</p><p>Over 200 items trace the Civil War era, through the 1860 election and 1864 re-election of Abraham Lincoln, the secession crisis of 1861, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, and the battles through to the close of the war. The Spanish-American War is also well-represented with about 270 caricatures from Puck, The Judge, The Bee, The Verdict, and other publications. The disputes between Britain and America and the resulting War for Independence, and then the War of 1812, are represented with many caricatures. The Mexican War, World War I, and World War II have lesser representation.</p><p>America's relation with the rest of the world is a common theme. Early on, through the Civil War, these seem to focus principally on concerns with how the European powers (including Russia) perceive the United States and how the new nation might be undermined. Post-Civil War, the theme seems to shift with the United States greater standing in relation to Europe, with an increased paternalism toward Asia and the Caribbean. </p><p>Social caricatures can also be found in the collection, often related to the changing role of women, the expanding wealth of the country, class tensions, and the like. Major national events, such as the Gold Rush, are the subject of several caricatures.</p><p>Major artists and publishers of lithographed cartoons represented in the collection include, among others, James Baillie, Edward W. Clay, Currier &amp; Ives, David Claypoole Johnston, Thomas Nast, Henry R. Robinson, and Thomas W. Strong. Among the original pen and ink drawings are approximately 35 by Thomas Nast, the chief American cartoonist of the 1870s and 80s.</p><p>The finding aid lists most of the caricatures in the collection individually. Titles were transcribed from catalog cards, supplemented with visual confirmation. Additional or clarifying subject headings noted by the archivists are included in [brackets]. Certain "sets" of caricatures, such as the 270 works concerning the Spanish-American War, were listed in more summary fashion.</p><p>Some items were not found in the collection during the inventory of 2019-22 although they did have a card catalog record. Generally, these items were listed in this inventory based on the catalog description and noted here as missing.</p>  </scopecontent>

There are well over 250 prints in the series.  Most of the series relates to Jacksonian era politics, such as the dissolution of Jackson's "kitchen cabinet" over the Petticoat affair, his veto of the renewal of the Second Bank of the United States, imagery of Jackson's imperiousness, and Van Buren's proposal for an independent Treasury (known as a sub-treasury). The presidential campaigns during this period are extensively represented, and many of the prints refer to the Loco-Focos, a faction of the Democratic Party from 1835 into the 1840s. The nullification crisis and abolitionism appear in some prints, either as a principal theme or as a sub-theme. Although images of Jackson and Van Buren predominate, others include John Calhoun, Henry Clay, Winfield Scott, Thomas Hart Benton, William Marcy, and William Henry Harrison, among others.</p><p>In addition to politics, several prints in this series concern social satire and class-based depictions. The series opens in 1828 with an extensive number of the "Life in Philadelphia" caricatures, with racist imagery of emancipated African-Americans in social settings. </p><p>Among the caricaturists that are particularly well-represented in the series are: H.R. Robinson, J. Childs, E.W. (Edward Williams) Clay, N. Sarony, A. Imbert, and Zek Downing.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_849e54defbc1f25e3678a48604f2016e"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged in approximate chronological order.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_e466689a69cdaccb33169908f90dbf73" level="file"><did><unittitle>Life in Philadelphia "How You Find Yourself..."

Most of the caricatures relate to the Presidential election campaigns of 1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856. Candidates featured include Henry Clay and James Polk (1844); Zachary Taylor, Lewis Cass, and Martin Van Buren (1848); Franklin Pierce and Winfield Scott (1852); and James Buchanan, John C. Frémont, and Millard Fillmore (1856). In addition to the principals, the vice-president candidates and major politicians affiliated with the candidate's parties or positions appear in the caricatures. The aging Andrew Jackson appears frequently in the caricatures of the early 1840s in association with Martin Van Buren and the Democratic Party. Similarly, Martin ("Matty") Van Buren also appears frequently during this period either as a principal in a presidential election or in the background connecting him to the Democratic Party. Among other individuals appearing are John Tyler, John Calhoun, Horace Greeley, and P.T. Barnum.</p><p>The themes of the caricatures touch on the major national issues of the 1840s-1850s, primarily in the context of presidential campaigns and party platforms, though also as standalone images. Images concerning slavery and abolition are found throughout the series, especially in the context of the Texas annexation, the dispute over whether to admit Kansas as a free or slave state ("Bleeding Kansas"), the possible acquisition of Cuba, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, and others. One image portrays the emergence of escapee Henry "Box" Brown from his box.</p><p>Other themes represented with at least a few caricatures are the War with Mexico (1846), the Wilmot Proviso (1846), the Oregon Territory border dispute (1846), the California Gold Rush (1849), and the Panic of 1857. Social caricatures include those related to the increasing role of women outside the domestic sphere and the working class men known as "b'hoys."</p><p>Among the caricaturists that are particularly well-represented in the series are: H.R. Robinson, J. Childs, E.W. (Edward Williams) Clay, James S. Baillie, H. Buoholzer (H. Bucholzer), Nathaniel Currier (beginning 1844), Sarony &amp; Major, F. &amp; S. Palmer, and John L.

Grant in 1868. There are about 280 prints in the series.</p><p>Prints from 1860 include all the candidates in a 4-way race: Lincoln of Illinois and Hannibal Hamlin of Maine (Republican), John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky and Joseph Lane of Oregon (Southern Democratic), John Bell of Tennessee and Edward Everett of Massachusetts (Constitutional Union), and Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and Herschel V. Johnson of Georgia (Northern Democratic). Horace Greeley of the Tribune appears often in the campaign caricatures (in support of Lincoln), as do other depictions of the press.  The image of Lincoln as the "rail splitter" is frequently used as a metaphor for him splitting the Union, with the abolition of slavery as a principal theme of the election.</p><p>1861 caricatures introduce the secession of the Southern states, with Jefferson Davis appearing frequently as the symbol of the South. The possibility of England's support for the South appears in several prints. In 1862, the emphasis begins to shift from the politics of secessionist maneuvering to war. Images of the human toll of death and injury begin to appear more frequently, with the theme of the Union's ineffective military leadership (e.g., Generals Pope and McClellan). 1863 brings into play the Emancipation Proclamation and the role of abolition in the war. European powers (England and France) and their geopolitical assessments are a frequent theme. There are continued images of Davis as traitor and the North fighting for liberty and to preserve the Union. Draft friction is depicted,  including scenes of draft riots. </p><p>1864 prints often center on the McClellan vs. Lincoln election. Anti-Lincoln campaign themes include the threat of miscegenation, his sacrifice of the Union for abolition, his unconstitutional actions, and his folksy story-telling as a way to avoid discussing the war. Anti-McClellan themes include his ineffectiveness as general, his willingness to sell out to the South, and the potential subservience of the North to the South. Ulysses Grant's effectiveness as a general emerges as a theme. The conclusion of the war in 1865 brings imagery of the South's defeat, especially in terms of Jefferson Davis's attempt to escape in woman's clothing. </p><p>Themes in the post-war years include Union triumphalism, not only in holding the nation together, but in its ability to face and compete with European powers by expanding territorially to Mexico and in overall military might; President Andrew Johnson and his actions against Radical Republican legislation; negative views of the impact of emancipation; and financial speculation. The series concludes with the campaign of 1868, with the potential social and political impact of African-American civil rights a significant theme. Throughout the series caricatures of African-Americans are often demeaning, even when intended to be sympathetic.</p><p>Among the caricaturists that are particularly well-represented in the series are Currier &amp; Ives and  J.L. Magee.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_a5e80c733bf893e945c3d1504592eaa9"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged in approximate chronological order.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_a704393964f65619d216fe6a218f74fb" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Great Match at Baltimore, Between the "Illinois Bantam", and The "Old Cock" of the White House.

Grant's administration to the close of the 19th century. There are about 530 prints in the series. About 270 of these, or about half the series, concern the Spanish-American War, with images from Puck, The Judge, The Bee, The Verdict, and other publications by Eugene Zimmerman, Victor Gillam, Grant E. Hamilton, Louis Dalrymple, Joseph Keppler, J.S. Pughe, Rose O'Neill Latham, Samuel Ehrhart, Horace Taylor, George Luks, MIRS, E. Noble, and others.</p><p>The series also includes many prints from the "Darktown" series of the 1880s drawn by Thomas Worth, James Cameron, and others and published by Currier &amp; Ives. These prints presented racist images of African-Americans in various before-and-after scenes; "before" scenes included African-Americans engaging in some social, leisure or other such activity, with the resulting "after" scene one of ineptitude and mayhem.</p><p>As with the earlier series, presidential elections are represented here, especially that of 1872. The 1872 election prints include Ulysses Grant as a do-nothing president surrounded by corruption against Horace Greeley as naïve, inexperienced and a front for the return of the Confederacy. Some of these 1872 election prints include appeals to African-Americans to switch their allegiance from the Republican Party. The elections of 1876 (Hayes/Tilden), 1880 (Garfield/Hancock), 1884 (Cleveland/Blaine), 1888 and 1892 (Cleveland/Harrison), and 1896 (McKinley/Bryan) are all represented to at least some degree. The politician and former Civil War general Benjamin F. Butler makes many appearances in the prints.</p><p>Financial themes run throughout the series, including images of railroad barons, financial dealings (gold panic of '69), taxation, the  economic power of monopolists/industrialists, and  tariff reform in the 1880s-90s. Political corruption, especially in the form of Tammany, is a common theme. Social caricatures are also found in the series, including images of women asserting rights/new roles at expense of men/masculinity and  sets of "men on the street" caricatures of well-known political, religious, business and other figures.</p><p>Caricaturists not mentioned above but represented in the series include Thomas Nast, Frank Bellew, Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son, D.E. Cronin, and others.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_2ba28818d54b1fbe67ee33725b3b39f3"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged in approximate chronological order.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_cd0420a51a92ac7f3fd22188ed6958ce" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Statue Unveiled.

Most of these concern political matters, especially in relation to Tammany Hall corruption in the early twentieth century and the policies and presidential campaigns of Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt. There are a few cartoons concerning World War I and World War II, less than 10 on each subject. Among the artists in this series are Rollin Kirby, C.G. Bush, D. McCarthy, C.R. Macauley, Maurice Kellen, McDougall, Albert T. Reid, John Cassel, and others. The series ends in 1943, except for one Stan Mack cartoon from 1977 (see Series VII for a few cartoons that date from some undetermined point in the late twentieth century).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_347aa9efc45ccd7649b06a0dccd1272b"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged in approximate chronological order.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_f8044701776e946b721456dafda8d747" level="file"><did><unittitle>No title.
