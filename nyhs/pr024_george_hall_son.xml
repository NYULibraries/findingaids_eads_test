    <head>Provenance</head>
<p>Approximately 2000 vintage negatives from the collection of James S. Hall were purchased on June 20, 1945. The indexes are presumed to have been produced by the George P. Hall &amp; Son firm and were probably donated with the collection. Modern prints were produced between 1968 and 1975 by commercial studios under contract with the New-York Historical Society in an effort to reformat the oversize glass negatives within this collection. Between 1968 and 1972 contact prints were produced by Klein Brothers Studio, New York; between 1974 and 1975 photographic prints were produced by Wometco Photographic Services, Inc., New York, and in 1975, photographic prints were produced by Compo Photocolor, New York. After printing, most of the negatives were destroyed. An additional 103 photographic prints were provided by the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House in about 1977 from negatives donated to them by the New-York Historical Society.  In 2010, an additional 39 glass plate negatives were donated by Dolores Ballaster.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The commercial photography firm George P. Hall &amp; Son operated in Manhattan from 1886 through 1914. Working out of several studios, the firm documented the changing face of New York City at the turn of the 20th century. Hall &amp; Son's photographs were available for general sale, were published in their own calendars and souvenir viewbooks, and appeared as illustrations in such publications as <title type="simple" render="italic">King's Views of New York</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Staley's Views of New York</title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">Harper's Weekly</title>.</p><p>George P. Hall (1832-1900) was born in 1832 in Troy, Ohio, and began his career in 1854 as a daguerreotypist in Dayton, Ohio. A year later he opened his first gallery in Indianapolis and then worked in St. Louis, before finally making his way to New York around 1872. He started his commercial photography business at 78 Fulton Street around 1875, and was officially joined by his son James S. Hall in 1886 when firm took the name George P. Hall &amp; Son. The father and son operated the company until 1900, when George P. Hall died. James S. Hall continued to run the business until about 1914. A brief note in the Business Troubles column of the <title type="simple" render="italic">New York Times</title> for June 4, 1914 indicates that creditors were filing a petition against Hall, and that he admitted his insolvency. It is presumed that the firm closed in the wake of these financial difficulties.</p><p>The Halls operated several studios in Manhattan. City directories published by Trow indicate that George P. Hall maintained a studio at 78 Fulton Street from 1876 to 1883. He moved his business to 157 Fulton Street in 1883, where he was joined by his son; that studio remained open until 1901. Later shops included those at 303 Broadway from 1890 to 1894, at 52 Water Street from 1897 to 1902, at 212 Broadway from 1901 to 1914, at 364 Bowery from 1902 to 1903, and at 230 Grand Street from 1903 to 1904. The Halls made their residences in Brooklyn, and often turned their cameras toward features of that city as well as Manhattan. They also worked as marine and engineering photographers.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The George P. Hall &amp; Son Photograph Collection spans the period from 1876 through 1914 and consists of vintage glass negatives, vintage photographic logbooks, and modern photographic contact prints printed from 1965 to 1975 from Hall &amp; Son's original oversize glass negatives. The collection is arranged into six series: Photographs of Manhattan; Photographs of Brooklyn, The Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island; Photographs Outside New York City; Photographs by Subject; Negatives; and Logbooks. Within each photographic subseries, photographs are divided into unmounted and mounted to accommodate preservation needs.</p><p>The large-format views in this collection provide clear, extremely detailed and flattering depictions of a variety of subjects, including Manhattan's early skyscrapers, hotels and theater exteriors, harbor activity, and downtown streets, as well as Brooklyn's business areas and resorts. George P. Hall &amp; Son photographed the Battery skyline repeatedly from the 1880s to the 1910s, documenting the dramatic changes that occurred as New York progressed from a lowrise to a highrise city. Many of Hall &amp; Son's views are notable for their high-angle perspectives. Like many commercial photographers of the time, Hall &amp; Son focused on the highlights of New York; the newest skyscrapers, the record-breaking bridges, and the most popular theaters and attractions. Views in this collection also depict many of the United States Navy's new steel battleships of the 1890s. Also included are some views of the Hall's business premises and family members. Hall &amp; Son primarily documented building exteriors; when interior views are available, this has been noted in the finding aid.</p><p>The photographic prints in this collection were made between 1965 and 1975 from George P. Hall &amp; Son's original glass plate negatives ranging in size from 11 x 14 to 11 x 18 to 14 x 17 inches. The majority of the original negatives from which these prints were created have been destroyed. The prints produced between 1965 and 1970 by Klein Brothers are unmounted prints with a matte finish; these show a greater variety of tone than the later high-contrast, glossy prints produced by Compo Photocolor, The International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House, and Wometco Photographic Services, which are mounted on paper board.</p><p>Some photographs bear brief descriptive captions, dates and negative numbers handwritten in block lettering on the original negatives and printed into the photographs. The majority of the photographs have been captioned on the verso by N-YHS staff; some of these descriptions correspond to those from the original negative sleeves, but many have been assigned progressively as staff members have researched photographs over the years. Some photographs have been given more detailed descriptions than others, reflecting this individual research.</p><p>Researchers should be aware that oversize negatives from a variety of other collections belonging to The New-York Historical Society were once integrated into the Hall Collection. While efforts were made during processing to separate out all materials that could be readily attributed to other photographers, some unmarked photographs within this collection may not be the work of George P. Hall &amp; Son. Attributions of these photographs should be made with caution.</p>  </scopecontent>

It is arranged into ten subseries by subject: Bridges and River Views; Churches and Temples; Cityscapes and Panoramas; Commercial Buildings; Hotels; Public Buildings and Institutions; Residences; Restaurants; Statues and Monuments; and Theaters. Each subseries is divided into mounted and unmounted. The views collectively document much of Manhattan, with a particular emphasis on major institutions, tourist attractions, waterfronts and bridges, and business districts. For convenience, this series includes photographs of popular tourist sites on the smaller, non-borough islands surrounding Manhattan; these include views of the Statue of Liberty, the Ellis Island Immigration Station, and Castle William on Governor's Island.</p><p>The Halls sometimes worked as marine photographers, and more generally turned their cameras toward the rivers, harbors, and bridges surrounding New York City. The Bridges and River Views subseries includes flattering views of the waterways of New York, including everything from iconic images of foot traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge to views of the three southern East River bridges. Many views encompass the rapidly changing New York skyline taken from the surrounding waterways.</p><p>The Churches and Temples subseries includes a variety exterior views of the oldest and most notable religious institutions in the city, including Trinity Church, St. Paul's Chapel, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine [Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine], and Temple Beth-El. Cityscapes and Panoramas includes views of the changing Manhattan skyline from a variety of vantage points. Hall &amp; Son frequented the roofs of tall buildings to capture the city from a dramatic overhead angle.</p><p>Commercial Buildings includes views of a variety of buildings, from banks to department stores, such as Saks &amp; Co. at its original Herald Square location, to such dramatic New York newcomers as the Flatiron (Fuller) Building during and after construction. Photographs in this subseries are mostly straightforward portraits of individual buildings; many of the same structures can be found within broader settings in the Street Scenes subseries. Photographs in the Hotels subseries are similar in nature to those of commercial buildings, primarily focusing on large elegant midtown hotels.</p><p>Public Buildings and Institutions contains views of many famous New York institutions, including a variety of views of Columbia University and Barnard College, City Hall, Federal Hall, and Tammany Hall. Photographs of the interior of Pennsylvania Station from the 1910s and of the excavation site before its construction are available in this series. Also included are views of several hospitals, museums (including The New-York Historical Society in 1907) and transportation centers.</p><p>Residences depicted include the Jumel Mansion and the Tiffany Mansion, as well as unidentified brownstones and Gramercy Square residences. Restaurants holds only a few images, including Delmonico's and the Metropolitan Club's interior with a banquet set for Mayor Seth Low. Statues and Monuments includes such notables as Grant's Tomb, the Statue of Liberty, and Washington Arch as well as smaller statuary.</p><p>Street Scenes is the largest subseries and provides rich documentation of the city. Buildings, street life, and transportation means are depicted with great detail. The subseries is arranged into three categories: Named Streets, Numbered Avenues, and Numbered Streets. Within these categories, photographs are arranged alphabetically, then by ascending address (for example, note that Broadway and Fifth Avenue sections of street scenes are arranged from south to north). This series also includes views of several of the popular squares and smaller parks in the city, including many photographs of Union Square and City Hall Park. Views of Broadway from its southern extremity at Bowling Green to 145th Street are available, as are photographs of the maritime businesses along South Street. Views of many of George P. Hall &amp; Son's business premises are included within this series. A few photographs in this series show a slightly darker side of Manhattan living, such as the depiction of slum buildings along Chrystie Street. Occasional copy work is included, such as a copy of "Broadway, north from Bond Street," by Mathew Brady from 1867.</p><p>Theaters depicted include many of the popular venues of the first decade of the 1900s. Included within this category are views of Madison Square Garden (including a few interior views of exhibits), the Belasco Theatre, the Hippodrome, and the Harlem Opera House.</p></scopecontent><c

Queens and Staten Island</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e7db5da5d708fa56ef29945a41f66ea2"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Series II consists of approximately 300 photographs of outer boroughs of New York City. Photographs are arranged alphabetically by borough and thereunder alphabetically by title/description. Because the subseries for Brooklyn is much larger than for the other boroughs, it has been further subdivided as described below. Each subseries or Brooklyn subject division is divided into unmounted and mounted photographs to accommodate conservation housing needs. Numbers in parentheses refer to the number of photographs available for that subject.</p><p>Photographs of The Bronx, Queens and Staten Island are very few. Railroad and streets scenes are complemented by a few photographs of residences, schools, and institutions, such as New York University's Library and the Hall of Fame in The Bronx. A view of Queens from the Queensboro bridge toll plaza, and a photograph of a toll gate building at Jamaica Avenue and Van Wyck Boulevard are available in the Queens subseries. The few photographs of Staten Island sites include those of the Anson Phelps Stokes House and the Staten Island Ferry Terminal in St. George.</p><p>Photographs of Hall's own borough of Brooklyn are more numerous and have been arranged in the following categories: Buildings, Churches, Cityscapes and Panoramic Views, Parks and Resorts, Residences, Statues and Monuments, and Street Scenes. Thereunder they are arranged alphabetically by title/description. </p><p>Buildings depicted include many prominent Brooklyn Institutions, including the Brooklyn Academy of Music, City Hall, the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences (Brooklyn Museum), and historic Ebbets Field. Images abound of Lutheran, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and Dutch Reformed churches. Cityscapes and Panoramic Views includes several rooftops views of Brooklyn, many of which include the riverfront.</p><p>The Parks and Resorts category is large, and contains views of Coney Island beaches, resorts, and hotels, as well as views of Prospect Park and Fort Greene Park. The new popular developments along Coney Islands beaches in the 1890s through the 1910s are particularly well documented. The Manhattan Beach Hotel and the Oriental Hotel are captured from a variety of vantage points, including those from ships off the coast.</p><p>Included in the Residences category is 642 Flatbush Avenue, the home of George P. Hall in the 1890s. Statues and Monuments includes a few views of the U.S. Grant Statue at Bedford and Dean Streets. Street Scenes are primarily along Atlantic Avenue, and include one unidentified parade scene.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref526_eoq" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>The Bronx and Brooklyn -

id="aspace_4b8392dc189e9d2848ea76c5c71b103a"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Series III consists of photographs of sites in the United States, focusing especially on areas of Long Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey. A few photographs of St. Louis, Missouri are also available, and include a view of the construction of buildings for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. A Newark, New Jersey photograph shows President Theodore Roosevelt standing with a statue of Abraham Lincoln by Gutzon Borglum in front of the Essex County Courthouse, probably taken during his dedication of the statue in 1911. A large group of mostly interiors of Sagtikos Manor, in West Bay Shore, Long Island are included in this series. This manor house was built in 1692 by New York mayor Stephanus Van Cortlandt, and was expanded twice in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The manor's antique furnishings are depicted here, include a bed in which George Washington is believed to have slept during a trip through Long Island in 1790.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref687_b0r" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Unmounted</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref688_6ou" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Connecticut</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref689_cf2" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Hartford -

Thereunder, they are arranged alphabetically by subject. Portraits include a variety of individuals, including both George P. Hall and James S. Hall and some of their family members. Other photographs in this subseries are mostly of organized groups or clubs, such as the St. Paul's School Mandolin Club, the Hope Fishing Club, and the Tansley Republican Club. Several portraits of unidentified individuals are included.</p><p>The Ships subseries is extensive, and consists mostly of photographs taken in the late 1890s of the U.S. Navy's new steel battleships around the time of the Spanish-American War. Many of the photographs were taken in New York Harbor, but harbor details are usually not included.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref745_guz" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Portraits - Unmounted</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref746_eqy" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Barnard, Frederick A.P., President of Columbia College (1865-1889) [photograph of painting]</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_4229dbc8171e5b9e8cbb506bfd09879f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">26</container><container parent="aspace_4229dbc8171e5b9e8cbb506bfd09879f" type="Folder">235</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref747_l3n" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Burns, J.B.G., family portrait on steps of residence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_d9d8c251bade27348c3bf3b5b9912f02" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">26</container><container parent="aspace_d9d8c251bade27348c3bf3b5b9912f02" type="Folder">235</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref748_eoy" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Civic Federation, interior</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_cae16d5285ad0222cd0a90e82697b386" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">26</container><container parent="aspace_cae16d5285ad0222cd0a90e82697b386" type="Folder">235</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref749_w02" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Drisler, Henry, Acting President of Columbia College (1888-1890) [photograph of painting]</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_114d2672a85cd2d5763df3c40125a35f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">26</container><container parent="aspace_114d2672a85cd2d5763df3c40125a35f" type="Folder">235</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref750_v3n" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Fire Co. 57 in front of Victoria Station</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_908c174980360d9c20ef1d50a676f740" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">26</container><container parent="aspace_908c174980360d9c20ef1d50a676f740" type="Folder">235</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref751_frs" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Hall, James S., studio portrait</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_7aab13ea087b6349dd2db052ebb05a7c" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">26</container><container parent="aspace_7aab13ea087b6349dd2db052ebb05a7c" type="Folder">235</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref752_a5u" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Hall, James S., with a group of unidentified friends (2)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_987ab29965158ebd38acd34fda96c30e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">26</container><container parent="aspace_987ab29965158ebd38acd34fda96c30e" type="Folder">235</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref753_c2k" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Hall, George P., family portrait at residence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_bc8e707d7d75b834dd12bab9eb597457" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">26</container><container parent="aspace_bc8e707d7d75b834dd12bab9eb597457" type="Folder">235</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref754_71h" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Hope Fishing Club on steps of unidentified building</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1911/1911" type="inclusive">1911</unitdate><container id="aspace_c5b93fda76a92143a7fd9214ddf615f6" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">26</container><container parent="aspace_c5b93fda76a92143a7fd9214ddf615f6" type="Folder">235</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref755_yjn" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Johnson, Rev.

Some of the negatives in this collection were formerly part of the Negative File (PR 045), and have that file's assigned negative numbers on their enclosures. Negatives are arranged by size and thereunder by negative numbers. Those Hall negatives without negative numbers are arranged by subject. The oversize glass negatives should not generally be consulted due to their extreme fragility; researchers should discuss particular needs with a curator before obtaining access. The majority of the oversize negatives in this series are represented by photographic prints in Series I. Where numbers are missing from the numbered negative sequence, negatives bearing these numbers were either determined to belong to other collections or are presumed to have been destroyed.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref845_ut1" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>5 x 7 to 6 1/2 x 8 1/2 inches</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref846_v36" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>New York City</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref847_hi5" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>111 Broadway, including Caldwell, Weston &amp; Co.

Hall &amp; Son. While they provide a valuable record of the firm's work from 1895 on, they are of very limited use as a guide to this collection. The indexes are arranged roughly alphabetically and thereunder by size, but subjects are sometimes entered by surnames; surnames sometimes refer to the company or individual for whom work was done, but may sometimes refer to the photographer. Many photographs are indexed only under very general subjects. Because in many cases images in this collection no longer bore the original photographer's number or description at the time of processing, the indexes are not a particularly useful tool for accessing this collection.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1073_qmy" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Logbook 1</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1895/1914" type="inclusive">[1895-1914]</unitdate><container id="aspace_719617bc9e2b9e8758d7875fa4afafb7" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1074_b4j" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Logbook 2</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1895/1914" type="inclusive">[1895-1914]</unitdate><container id="aspace_c989adef286e38566e86db5f127471ed" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">2</container></did></c></c></dsc>
