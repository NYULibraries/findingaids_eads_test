    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Harry Schwartz was born in March of 1935 in Brooklyn, New York.  He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1956, a Master of City Planning from the University of Pennsylvania in 1960, and attended the University of Rome on a Fulbright Fellowship between 1963 and 1964.</p><p>Schwartz began his career working on urban poverty, housing and public services for municipal and private agencies, including the Boston Redevelopment Authority (1962-1963), New York City's Department of City Planning (1965-1965) and the New York City Housing Department (1965-1967).</p><p>For the next 15 years, from 1968 to 1983, Schwartz was a partner in Abeles, Schwartz and Associates, a planning consultancy firm that worked on a broad range of planning and development projects and studies in urban settings. Clients included community development organizations in New York City, Buffalo, Yonkers, Atlantic City, Pittsburgh, and other cities; private firms; and government agencies. Among the many services the firm provided were strategic planning, market and real estate studies, economic feasibility evaluations, zoning reviews and environmental impact assessments, mediation, and assistance with financing.</p><p>In 1984, Schwartz founded the Garment Industry Development Corporation, which he describes as the nation's first economic development corporation dedicated to a specific industry. The company provided worker training and education; business assistance aimed at helping firms obtain capital, enhance productivity and introduce new technology; and real-estate assistance to prevent factory space from being converted into residences and to help firms obtain mortgages and government assistance.</p><p>In 1988, Schwartz became an independent consultant on economic development, housing, social and health services, and neighborhood planning. In this capacity, he worked with multiple institutions within and outside New York City including the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, the United States Department of Justice, the Harlem Urban Development Corporation; multiple institutions within St. Louis, Missouri; and the CUNY Institute for Urban Systems, among others.</p><p>Throughout his career, Schwartz focused on programs to alleviate poverty and narrow economic inequities, promote economic development, build affordable housing, provide relief efforts for natural disasters, protect environmental resources and provide services for elderly residents of city neighborhoods.</p><p>In addition to his consultant activities, Schwartz taught urban planning at various institutions, including Hunter College-CUNY, Washington University in St. Louis, and Columbia University. He was also heavily involved in civic activities, especially within New York City. He served on the Board of Directors for Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center and the House for Elder Artists, and has also been involved with the Waterfront Committee for the Parks Council, the Morningside Heights Historic District Committee, and the Friends of St. John the Divine.</p>  </bioghist>

It was a group made up of urban planners, and was officially a subsidiary of the American Institute of Planners.  The goal of the PEO was to increase housing opportunities for minority families, as well as looking at quality, availability, and price of existing housing.  The organization disbanded in 1976.  As a member of PEO, Schwartz was an editor of their newsletter, <emph render="italic">Equalop.</emph></p><p>The Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Company was established in 1992 as a non-profit industrial developer in North Brooklyn.  They focus on repairing and refurbishing manufacturing buildings for occupancy by smaller manufacturing companies in an effort to create new employment opportunities for low-income residents.  Schwartz was the Secretary on the Board of Directors.</p><p>The Morningside Heights Historic District Committee was created in 1996 in an attempt to preserve the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, through its designation as a historic district.</p><p>Friends of St. John the Divine was a splinter group of the Morningside Heights Historic District Committee, and was led by Schwartz.  The main focus of this group was to fight against the building of a 15 story luxury apartment building on the property of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, which is located at 1047 Amsterdam Avenue in New York City.  This fight ultimately failed, and the apartment complex was built.</p><p>The Committee for a Fair Riverside south raised objections to funding for Donald Trump's luxury urban development project in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  The development began construction in 1997.</p></bioghist><c id="aspace_ref26_hnd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Planners for Equal Opportunity</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1967, 1999</unitdate><container id="aspace_f3493304ebf832e51ea6a12288f38478" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_f3493304ebf832e51ea6a12288f38478" type="Folder">17</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_531895b541f9b7df370980fea9d69195"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes research findings and alternative proposals, a history of the organization, and a reunion program</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref25_js0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1993-2013</unitdate><container id="aspace_9b0cc81b724d63c072625c7eb9ab0b72" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_9b0cc81b724d63c072625c7eb9ab0b72" type="Folder">18-23</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fbd21dfe2f32d41e2401f07d9859686f"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes background on the organization, tenant surveys, board reports and a strategic plan, as well as annual reports for the organization.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref23_jvl" level="file"><did><unittitle>Morningside Heights Historic District committee</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">2011-2014, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_1d4daa31223ec5a415d080ca0e9b1d9f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_1d4daa31223ec5a415d080ca0e9b1d9f" type="Folder">24-25</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f3c02967703e1173bfc7b1adb72c1d79"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes fliers; meeting notes, minutes, and agendas; pamphlets; a resident tool kit for corresponding with city officials and organizations; bulletins and announcements; and a copy of one of the MHHDC proposals</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref22_pka" level="file"><did><unittitle>Friends of St. John the Divine</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">2012-2014, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_a6457db9e40f303a127c4c7e8f79341e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_a6457db9e40f303a127c4c7e8f79341e" type="Folder">26-28</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d5c1740bcec6afab9fb57cf574f70048"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes posters and fliers; petitions; meeting minutes and agendas; internal correspondence; and correspondence with church and city officials, and the Landmarks Preservation Committee.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref24_j4t" level="file"><did><unittitle>Committee for a Fair Riverside South</unittitle><container id="aspace_e59309367a559075b5c0396d10af3ef9" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_e59309367a559075b5c0396d10af3ef9" type="Folder">29</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f81bcf6aadf6b1e6d7a9c37d5a9efe6a"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes short reports regarding affordable and market rate apartments; apartment sizes and the issues surrounding zero or one bedroom apartments; cost concerns; and objections to public subsidies.</p></scopecontent></c></c></dsc>
