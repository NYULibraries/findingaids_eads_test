    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Hunt Family Papers, consisting of letters, photographs, and newspaper clippings, document some of the history of the Hunt family from their arrival in the United States in the 19th century to the mid-20th century. The first generation -- Edwin and Sophia Hunt -- immigrated to the United States in the 1830s. According to later family accounts, Sophia Hunt had at least six siblings in Liverpool, including Alfred William Hunt, an English watercolor painter who was associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood movement of the mid-19th century. Edwin Hunt, who was Sophia Hunt's first cousin as well as husband, became a businessman involved in importing and selling goods from Great Britain with the enterprise Chance Brothers in New York City. Together, the two had ten children, including Clara, Sophia Darling, Louise, Amelia (Amy), Esther Maria, and Clement, all of whom are mentioned in the materials. The Hunts frequently went back to England to visit family and corresponded frequently with family and friends overseas. </p><p>Sometime after 1850, the family relocated to Chicago. Not much is known about the Hunt family between 1856 and 1870, and this time in their lives is not reflected in the collection. The Chicago Fire of 1871 was economically and personally devastating for the family. Some of the daughters were sent to Europe to travel and study, as documented in the materials. Between 1872 and 1874, the Hunt daughters traveled through England, Netherlands, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. Their mother, Sophia Hunt, visited them periodically and wrote to her husband in Chicago.</p><p>After the deaths of Edwin and Sophia Hunt (in 1874 and 1883, respectively), their children spread beyond Chicago -- some returning to England, others to New York, and still others throughout the rest of the midwestern United States.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Hunt family letters were passed down through the generations from Sarah Hunt (1814-1883) to her daughter Sarah Darling Hunt Weston (1849-1935). Sarah Weston then passed them to her daughter, Edith Kate Weston Ferree (1885-1975), who, in turn, gave them to her daughter, Ruth Weston Ferree Wessels (1911-2005). Ruth Weston Ferree Wessels finally gave the letters to her daughter, Sarah Louise Wessels (born 1946), the donor of this collection.</p>  </custodhist>
