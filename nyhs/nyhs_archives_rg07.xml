    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The New-York Historical Society press clippings record group includes material compiled regularly by N-YHS from published sources from about 1870 to about 2014. The record group also holds some clippings from as early as 1843. The material includes clippings and tearsheets from newspapers, general interest magazines, museum, antiques, and other specialist journals, and other print matter. These clippings are compiled in 28 boxed volumes of scrapbooks and, from about 1970, in subject-oriented files and binders. Although perhaps most of the clippings are from New York sources, there are a substantial number of clippings from other U.S. cities and even from the international press (accordingly, many of these are not in English). The record group also holds a small number of reprints and copies of essays written about N-YHS and its collections in books and journals. </p><p>The subjects of the articles in the record group are wide-ranging. Topics relate to N-YHS exhibitions, lectures, publications, and other programs and events; acquisitions of new collections or objects; implementation of major new initiatives (e.g. the Field Exploration Committee, circa 1917-1938); building construction on Central Park West (1900s and 1930s); management controversies (e.g., Mrs. Van Rensselaer's reform movement of circa 1917 and the financial difficulties of the 1980s-1990s); and recognitions, leadership changes, obituaries (e.g., the death of Director Alexander Wall in 1944), and other matters connected to individuals. Overall, the record group provides insight into the extent of press coverage of N-YHS, press perceptions of the organization and its programs, and a broad overview and narrative of events in N-YHS's history as presented in the press.</p>  </scopecontent>

Although there are articles dating from as early as 1843, the regular content of the scrapbooks appears to begin principally in 1871. The scrapbooks advance with increasing consistency and quantity well into the twentieth century, pausing about 1972, and then picking up with some final volumes covering various years in the 1980s and 1990s, ending with 1991. </p><p>Articles related to N-YHS concern exhibitions, lectures, and other programs and events; acquisitions of new collections or objects; activities of the Field Exploration Committee and other initiatives; building construction, management controversies, and other organizational issues; and recognitions, leadership changes, obituaries, and other matters connected to individuals. Newspapers represented are principally from New York City and Brooklyn (e.g., <emph render="italic">Herald, </emph>  <emph render="italic">Evening Post, </emph>  <emph render="italic">Tribune, </emph>  <emph render="italic">American, </emph>  <emph render="italic">Sun, </emph>  <emph render="italic">Times, </emph>  <emph render="italic">World, </emph>  <emph render="italic">New York Commercial, </emph>  <emph render="italic">Evening Telegram, </emph>  <emph render="italic">Citizen</emph> (Brooklyn), <emph render="italic">Standard Union</emph> (Brooklyn), <emph render="italic">Times</emph> (Brooklyn), and others). Other cities and states are also represented (e.g., Providence, Cleveland, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, various New Jersey papers, and others). Some clippings retained their transmittal information so the work of providers such as Henry Romeike, Inc., Argus Pressclipping Bureau, Selective Service Clipping Co., and Burrelle's is evident.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_3f0710527cfd91721a2586f05c6d7d6b"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The scrapbooks are arranged in chronological order, although this is only approximate for the first six books as their date ranges do not proceed in a strictly sequential manner. The titles of the volumes used in the container list were taken, when present, from the scrapbooks; [bracketed] titles were supplied by the archivist.</p><p>The clippings in the scrapbooks, especially those from the nineteenth century and into the mid-twentieth century, are very fragile and must be handled with great care. Many clippings, especially in the earliest volumes, are not secured to pages of the scrapbook, but are simply inserted at various points. Clippings that come loose or break during use should be brought to the attention of the reference librarian. </p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_2c39dd9aaecbda3d7540ff29e1bb2788"><head>Processing Information Note</head><p>The series was processed by project archivist Larry Weimer in September 2015.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_ref91_i4a" level="file"><did><unittitle>[Clippings]</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1858-1859</unitdate><container id="aspace_e2f2c4013bb73311abba7f510d167da9" label="Mixed Materials [10170000021178]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_e2f2c4013bb73311abba7f510d167da9" type="Volume">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2ad831edfa7ff6974a7618282b075b83"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes clippings concerning notable New York City events and other matters of the time, articles about New York's history, and just a few articles about N-YHS.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref372_shj" level="file"><did><unittitle>Newspaper Cuttings Related to the NY Historical Society</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1844-1909</unitdate><container id="aspace_ba726b97b95fdf5d83017d9ae10de9ae" label="Mixed Materials [10170000021177]" type="Offsite-Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_ba726b97b95fdf5d83017d9ae10de9ae" type="Volume">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c4ce534357b6b663df02ef648d6dff61"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>The core scrapbook includes clippings from 1871-1907, with loose clippings at the front of the album ranging from 1844 to 1909.

The series was minimally processed so the documents within the folders remain, for the most part, as found, with no particular order to them. Not all clippings in each folder were reviewed for their dates so the date ranges shown in the container list, though generally accurate, may not be precise in all instances.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_33a201b3292772883b119844406e5f14"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>The Subject Files include clippings and tearsheets from newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and other publications concerning various N-YHS matters. The bulk of the files relate to exhibitions or other N-YHS programs and events. Many of the clippings in the exhibition files are articles about or reviews of the program, but many clippings are just brief notices from published event listings and the like. </p><p>In addition to the specific exhibition or other topical files, each year in the series from 1970 forward includes a file of general clippings. These include a broad mix of subjects, from general institutional matters to passing references to N-YHS in articles or published listings to items of only tangential interest. N-YHS's financial difficulties and other organizational issues of the 1980s and 1990s attracted much press coverage; these articles are primarily found in topical files, but some are in the general clippings as well. </p><p>Although the bulk, by far, of the series consists of original or photocopied clippings from sources outside of N-YHS, some of the files also include documents from N-YHS's Public Relations Department, such as press releases and summaries of references in the press (called press round-ups or coverage reports), especially for events such as exhibitions. Some documents include brief staff notes, internal memos, or press correspondence related to coverage, especially for exhibitions. A very few folders include exhibition checklists, labels, booklets, or other material directly connected to the event; documents of this kind are noted at the folder level in the container list.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_a21b4366db1c684dad64a403168268bf"><head>Processing Information Note</head><p>The bulk of this series was processed perhaps circa 2000, with documents transferred from original folders to archival containers. In August 2015, archival intern Margaret Kaczorowski performed some additional processing steps and documented the holdings in the container list. Over the course of 2015-2016, project archivist Larry Weimer also added a small amount of material and completed the description for the finding aid.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_ref18_e3q"

In large part these were provided to N-YHS by Burrelle's and other media monitoring services. The coverage relates to particular exhibitions as well as to other N-YHS events, programs, etc. A distinguishing feature of this series is that most of the documents were packaged in plastic pouches and stored in binders. In most instances, the materials were removed from the binders during processing.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_6d780d6d3cd2273bfcd28836f7608089"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series retains its original order, which is chronological.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_b4f2fdf303bc6ac5c9ea6b8cd0eaadaa"><head>Processing Information</head><p>The documents were transfered to the Archives from the Communications Department in April 2019 and were added to the finding aid by archivist Larry Weimer in August 2021.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_592713f2a9fb02acb41a8cff9ca29ff7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Media coverage binders</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2004-2005</unitdate><container id="aspace_dc405098c0a8c512c9cf896c582e4fb7" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018201]" type="Offsite-Box">41</container></did></c><c id="aspace_bb75c2aced317ab84babcb8ce592d9bd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Media coverage binders</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2005</unitdate><container id="aspace_880e3ad573b42ec47432cce81d5fa913" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018202]" type="Offsite-Box">42</container></did></c><c id="aspace_dc0e0b5a42b1aef08a5cb351a7727e24" level="file"><did><unittitle>Media coverage binders</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2005-2006</unitdate><container id="aspace_2f4d01c88083fa6930d555ae585e7640" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018203]" type="Offsite-Box">43</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_000bd667d9fcaaf85f92632ac74ad4b4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes among the packets one that summarizes media placement during October 2005-April 2006 for the Slavery in New York exhibition.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_285dba59872b980e74004666e67795ce" level="file"><did><unittitle>Media coverage binders</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2006</unitdate><container id="aspace_57c50fc524e32fcecbaefcc3b984bcf5" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018204]" type="Offsite-Box">44</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f5b4e1b715be266453136ebb8a026806" level="file"><did><unittitle>Media coverage binders</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2006</unitdate><container id="aspace_47e5860690bdcb0f2efa985bad669f58" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018205]" type="Offsite-Box">45</container></did></c><c id="aspace_46d3dbd7318108112120d5cbb46929cb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Media coverage binders</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007</unitdate><container id="aspace_fcd706e70479c2a89a97a26de0a5804a" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018206]" type="Offsite-Box">46</container></did></c><c id="aspace_5eba3471c76cb2e3400cbbb81d99eca5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Media coverage binders</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2007</unitdate><container id="aspace_aba277c075130df9481bf8af0dd233e3" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018207]" type="Offsite-Box">47</container></did></c><c id="aspace_7d8a840b78b74cefa13a91dbe9f7717d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Media coverage binders</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2008</unitdate><container id="aspace_29fa088593f369d1717905f0f5fcff97" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018208]" type="Offsite-Box">48</container></did></c><c id="aspace_e0e80c50d349b7f7ce4a00a463398263" level="file"><did><unittitle>Media coverage binders</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2008-2009, 2013-2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_8c6f847c296e3f1ceb4c40dda6fd60a8" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018209]" type="Offsite-Box">49</container></did></c></c></dsc>
