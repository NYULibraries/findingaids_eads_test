    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>For the majority of Time Inc.'s existence, the company maintained a strict separation of editorial from the publishing and business side of each magazine, colloquially called the separation of "church" (editorial) and "state" (publishing). Publishing and Business Management includes the publisher, general manager, business manager, advertising sales, marketing services, letters, circulation, and public relations. The editorial side reported up to the editor-in-chief and the publishing/business side reported up to the corporate business executive who was the president prior to 1960 and the chief executive officer after that. Henry Luce structured Time Inc. this way so that the business side could not (in theory) influence the editorial content of the publications. For example, the advertising sales people could not interfere with a magazine's decision to run an article on the dangers of cigarette smoking, even though it might mean losing millions of dollars in tobacco ads.</p><p>In February 1936, Luce came up with the idea of creating a picture magazine. Luce proposed his new magazine concept to Time Inc. executives. At first, the group thought that Luce wanted to increase the number of pictures include in <title render="italic">Time</title> or that he wanted to add a supplement to the magazine but Luce was adamant that he wanted to create a magazine focused on photo journalism. While the executives were suspicious, Luce knew the idea could work. Luce's faith in the concept came from his experience with <title render="italic">Fortune</title>. <title render="italic">Fortune</title>, itself, was almost a photo journalism magazine and had been innovative in its use of photography. If these advances could be combined with <title render="italic">Time</title>'s editorial content, <title render="italic">Life</title> could be a success. </p><p>After doing some initial research and testing, Time Inc. published the first issue of <title render="italic">Life</title> on November 23, 1936. In the original proposal to the board, the magazine would be the same size as the <title render="italic">Illustrated London News</title> and printed on shiny paper with around 200 high-quality photographs recording significant current news events including detailed captions. By presenting the images in this fashion, Luce hoped that the reader would be able to both enjoy what they were seeing but also be able to study the images to gain a logical understanding of what was happening in the world around them.</p><p>At the magazine's launch, it would cost 10 cents per issue, or $3 per year for a subscription. Based on the price of the magazine, they decided to name it <title render="italic">Dime, The Show-Book of the World</title> but quickly decided to change its name. According to Elson, staff and charter subscribers were asked to submit other names, and the title <title render="italic">Life</title> was suggested by both cofounder Henry Luce's wife Clare Luce and Time Inc. president James Linen's father. Since the name was already in use by another publication, Luce purchased it in order to acquire the rights.</p><p>The first staff members in 1936 were Luce as managing editor, John Martin as Luce's alternate and proposed sucessor as <title render="italic">Life</title>'s managing editor, Daniel Longwell as picture editor, Alfred Eisenstaedt and Peter Stackpole as staff photographers, and Mary Fraser as copy chief. Despite a strong staff and a good concept, the magazine's financial outlook was ambiguous. Based on their pre-launch research, they knew that circulating the magazine wouldn't be a problem since most readers were attracted by the pictures and wanted to purchase the magazine to find out more. The real problem was figuring out how to turn a profit. </p><p>If <title render="italic">Life</title> followed the example of magazines like <title render="italic">Time</title> and <title render="italic">Fortune</title> then the way to make a profit would to be to rely on magazine subscriptions to cover the costs of printing and publication. Because of the high cost for making <title render="italic">Life</title>, doing this would make the magazine too expensive for the average reader. Instead of relying on subscriptions, <title render="italic">Life</title> would rely on advertising to bring in the needed revenue. With this idea in mind, the money made from the magazine's circulation would be used to cover the cost of printing the magazine but advertising revenue would cover everything else. </p><p>During <title render="italic">Life</title>'s run, it was one of Time Inc.'s most successful ventures in terms of subscriptions and reader response but struggled with production and financing. Even though <title render="italic">Life</title> was popular, Time Inc. could not financially sustain production of <title render="italic">Life</title> and suspended its production as a weekly magazine in December 1972. Almost as soon as production was suspended, Time Inc. began planning <title render="italic">Life</title>'s revival. The Magazine Development department published the first <title render="italic">Life</title> special in 1973 as a newsstand magazine followed by nine more. Time Inc. revived <title render="italic">Life</title> as a monthly in 1978. In 2000, publication was again suspended, but revived in 2004 as a newspaper supplement. In 2007, Time Inc. completely ceased printing of <title render="italic">Life</title> and created a website for images from the collection.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>Elson, Robert T. 1968. <title render="italic">Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1923-1941</title>.

Included in this series are financial statements, budget reports, budget forecasts, budget estimates, mechanical budgets, and operating statements. While the materials are grouped together, it is unclear which office they originated from since there are a variety of names listed on the documents. Some items indicate that the reports were for the business office but do not indicate a specific office of origin or owner.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

In 1954, these two separate departments were consolidated into one Market Research department but this department disappears from the department heads lists in 1964. Since much of the work done by Market Research overlapped with the work done in the Circulation department, it is believed that Circulation absorbed Market Research. Market Research and Circulation also tended to work conjointly on research projects.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_b9f05ea5a62106cee2e07e9802c2449f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Market Research Department Files include materials from 1946 to 1970 and focus on researching circulation statistics.
