    <head>Biographical Notes</head>
<p><emph render="boldunderline">Marilynn Gelfman Karp:</emph></p><p>Marilynn Gelfman Karp was born in the Bronx, New York, in 1939. Her penchant for collecting began early in childhood, with the careful culling of objects from her everyday life, including things that came in the family mail (greeting cards, attractive postcards, circulars), from family life (milk bottle lids, cigar bands, cigar boxes, campaign buttons, advertising giveaways), things that were found in the street (odd bits of metal, rocks, phenomena with power), gleaned from the grocery store (wooden cheese boxes, fruit crate labels), purchased from or found around the local candy store (bubblegum cards, Dixie lids, soda bottle tops), or from Woolworth's (Jack O'Lanterns, marbles, dexterity games, skate keys), or things from the luncheonette (sugar packets, soda fountain cut-outs).  Relatives occasionally gave her relevant objects (foreign coins from service in World War II, pipe tobacco tins, cocktail mixers, figural matches, license plate key chain tags). As she grew up, Karp spent her allowance on things that were important to her (Indian bubblegum cards, trading cards, Cracker Jacks for the prizes, cockamamies, radio premium rings and decoders) and packaging that was compelling (hairnet envelopes, decals).</p><p>A deep fascination and perceptive appreciation for the beauty and meaning in everyday objects has characterized her collecting ever since. Karp's passion for collecting is equally shared with her husband, contemporary art dealer Ivan C. Karp, who has been an integral appreciator and inspiration for Karp in the formation of her over 200 well-managed and archivally kept collections of ephemera. Stopping at every flea market, antique show, antique shop, collectibles show, and yard sale that looks interesting to her, she describes these venues as having one thing in common: "they are places of unconditional seeking and possessing.  Each object has a story to tell, somewhat fleshing out a time." </p><p>Collecting on instinct, each object that Karp has chosen to own is recognized by her as "a material incident in which time and place coalesce in a palpably pungent way." Scanning the past, she considers the objects she encounters in their "much diminished range from when they were new," trying to prevent the "irreversible elimination" of what she feels are "significant and resounding things that inform us about the times in which they were made."  </p><p>Karp's collecting activities have been additionally informed by her educational background and professional accomplishments in the visual arts. Receiving both a B.F.A. in Studio Art (1958) and an M.A. in Art History (1962) from Hunter College, she then went on to earn a Ph.D. in Physics and Aesthetics from New York University (1965), where she served as a Professor of Art at NYU's Steinhardt School, Department of Art and Art Professions for 42 years. Initially teaching basic 3D design and art history in Western culture, Karp's teaching activities later gravitated toward American art and architecture in the context of cultural history. In this capacity, she was actively involved with M.A. and M.F.A. graduating exhibition classes, and as an advisor, reader, and chair, for many doctoral dissertation committees in art, critical studies, and material culture. </p><p>During her years as a professor at NYU, Karp made important and far-reaching contributions to the study of material culture within the University's curriculum, designing and instituting the country's first Master's degree in Visual Arts Administration and Collecting, an M.A. Program in Folk Art (NYU in collaboration with the American Folk Art Museum, NY) and an M.A. program in Costume Studies (NYU in collaboration with the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute). </p><p>Beyond her successful career in academia, Karp is a professional sculptor of international achievement, and is an American Academy of Arts and Letters Sculptor's Award recipient. Her collecting interests have helped to shape her creative work, which utilizes a variety of mixed media and found objects. Additionally, she has served as a Trustee and Board Member for a number of organizations devoted to historic preservation and art in public spaces, including the Preservation League of New York State, The Public Art Fund, and the Anonymous Arts Recovery Society.</p><p>In 2006, Karp chronicled her adventures in collecting with the publication<emph render="italic"><extref xlink:href="http://www.inflagrantecollecto.info/">In Flagrante Collecto</extref></emph>, published by Harry N. Abrams, which celebrates the odd, arcane, quotidian collectible, as both an object of desire and of cultural anthropology. With the donation of this collection of ephemera to the New-York Historical Society, it is her belief and hope that the public-at-large will be afforded an important brush with material culture, and that museums in general will continue to preserve and serve up these objects to future audiences who will see them with the perspective and clarity that distance affords. </p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Ivan Karp and OK Harris:</emph></p><p>Ivan Karp was an art dealer, author, and American gallerist. Karp was considerably involved in the Photo Realist movement in 1969. He was co-director at the Leo Castelli Gallery between 1959 – 1969, during which time he was instrumental in launching the careers of many renowned pop artists, most notably Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Tom Wesselmann and John Chamberlain. In 1969 Karp decided to launch his own gallery, OK Harris, which was located on 465 West Broadway and survived from 1969 until June 2014. The establishment of OK Harris as the first gallery on West Broadway made a significant contribution to the development of the SoHo area's fine arts character. OK Harris exhibited contemporary art and photography, and on occasion mounted shows of antiques and collectibles. The gallery's aim was to show significant artwork without prejudice as to the style or materials employed, the sole criteria was innovation of concept and maturity of technique. Karp died on June 28, 2012 at the age of 86, in New York. OK Harris closed its doors in June 2014. </p>  </bioghist>

The greeting card or "message of good will" as a personal form of communication has a long history, but emerged commercially during the 19th century, concurrent with the rise of a new and prosperous leisured middle class, the advent of reliable, efficient postal service, and new forms of mechanization in printing methods that made the mass production of color printing affordable for the first time. In America, the first leading exponent of the greeting card was German lithographer Louis Prang (1824-1909) who is credited as being the first to introduce chromolithography to the production of greeting cards in America. By the early 20th century, the foundations for a full-fledged industry had been laid with the founding of Hallmark (today, the world's largest greeting card company) in 1910. Throughout the 20th century, the variety of card themes and sentiments would evolve dramatically, from traditional annual celebrations to the acknowledgement of almost every experience in everyday life.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref154_w63" level="file"><did><unittitle>Birthday -- Specific Age</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1925-1940</unitdate><container

These early "Postal Mailing Cards" were pre-stamped and government issued, until the Private Mailing Card Act of 1898 allowed for the independent production of postcards (called "Private Mailing Cards" until 1901, when the government first permitted privately-issued postcards to use the words "Post Card" on their reverse side). Until 1907, postcards had no "divided backs," as all messages for the addressee were allowed only on the face of the card--often in a designated message box. The advent of Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, contributed to the immense popularity of "view cards" (or "picture postcards"), which sparked a postcard-collecting craze throughout the country, reaching its zenith in 1915. Following World War I, the postcard industry (previously dominated by German production) flourished in the United States, with millions of postcards produced, mailed, and collected annually. Today, postcards from the past continue to fascinate us, offering a compelling window into topographical and social history.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_0230a9866607cd8e1a9f4fc2ca9ae989"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>The postcards in this series have been arranged thematically with subject titles assigned by the collector.

In the 1870s, the lithographer and printer Louis Prang was influential in popularizing the idea of cheaply mass-producing such cards for the needs of the advertising trade. Sometimes inserted into packages, they served as an effective means of advertising goods and services (similar to today's business cards), and had the additional appeal of offering the consumer a collectable giveaway item. Trade cards were often produced in a numbered series of related images (such as the Sollers &amp; Co. full set in this collection) that could be incorporated into artistic crafts and scrapbooks. By the beginning of the 20th century, the production of trade cards fell into gradual disuse with the increasing prevalence of advertising in magazines and newspapers. </p><p>This series also includes a complete set of John F. Kennedy trading cards, issued by Topps in 1964. The set includes 77 cards with a large black and white photo on the front and a short caption describing the image on the back. Images depict Kennedy as President and as family man, relaxing with his wife Jackie and kids Caroline and John.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_8a69e5dfbe6452416994cdb9f2711434"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>This series of trade cards was received from the collector in three-ring binders and later disbound and rehoused.

Like trade cards, they served as portable forms of advertising for various goods and services, often emphasizing domestic and travel-related imagery.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref144_1q1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Needle Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1870-1925</unitdate><container id="aspace_50216844ab3c3c4bc814793d51b47737" label="Graphic Materials [1804000030021]" type="Offsite-Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_50216844ab3c3c4bc814793d51b47737" type="Folder">80</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref147_4mv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Needle Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1910s-1950s</unitdate><container id="aspace_18e5b01d410f4a03856bf0f7c774c844" label="Graphic Materials [1804000030021]" type="Offsite-Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_18e5b01d410f4a03856bf0f7c774c844" type="Folder">83</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref145_27k" level="file"><did><unittitle>Needle Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1920s-1950s</unitdate><container id="aspace_cd9d16b11283a5ed75f0f10724015179" label="Graphic Materials [1804000030021]" type="Offsite-Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_cd9d16b11283a5ed75f0f10724015179" type="Folder">81</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref146_56o" level="file"><did><unittitle>Needle Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1920s-1950s</unitdate><container id="aspace_861f7efcf9a883cfbbd258c8f7f52f73" label="Graphic Materials [1804000030021]" type="Offsite-Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_861f7efcf9a883cfbbd258c8f7f52f73" type="Folder">82</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref30_9ld" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series VII.

While the practice of utilizing printed labels is as old as printing itself, modern package design did not begin to evolve until after the Civil War when advancements in printing, paper production and chromolithography made the affordable mass production of elaborate and colorful designs possible. By 1900, chromolithography would reach its zenith, prompting some to call the latter half of the 19th century the period of "chromo-civilization." Included here are various examples of how printed labels were utilized for packaging, identification, and instructive purposes, displaying a fascinating compendium of design styles and influences reflective of their eras.</p><p><emph render="bold">Hatbox Labels:</emph> The modern hatbox (a derivative of the Victorian bandbox) was a frequent item found among the possessions of both men and women well into the mid 20th century, when the wearing of hats was customary for all occasions. As a valued accessory, it was a standard practice for hats to be sold with hatboxes for their protection. These boxes (commonly made of sturdy pasteboard and decorative paper), came adorned with an elegant label displaying the name of the manufacturer or department store where purchased, along with a convenient carrying strap. In this way, the box transcended its practicality by serving as a portable form of status and advertising for both the owner and the retailer. Perhaps because of their usefulness as physical containers, attractive packaging, and the sentiment attached to them as objects of value, many hatboxes have survived among families over several generations and continue to be utilized and collected for a variety of purposes. </p><p><emph render="bold">Luggage Labels:</emph> Luggage labels, with their elegant graphics featuring exotic locals, luxury modes of transportation, and grand hotels, bear witness to the "Golden Age of Travel," a period which spanned the late 19th century to the outbreak of World War II. Affixed to luggage by railroad companies, steamships, hotels, and resorts, they provided the practical means of identifying luggage destination, but also served as romantic advertisements for the destinations themselves.  For the traveler, such labels were a sign of personality, taste and status, and over the course of years, their accumulation provided an autobiographical history of places visited, hotels stayed in, and transportation used. A remnant of past places and times, they beautifully evoke the spirit of this bygone era.</p><p><emph render="bold">Please Remit:</emph> The economic prosperity of the 1950s, spurred by the growth of commercial advertising and the introduction of the modern credit card, gave way to unprecedented consumer optimism and spending, as more and more Americans embraced the ease and convenience of "putting it on plastic" as a way to pay for purchases. For many collection agencies, a useful aid in collecting debts was the "Please Remit" notice, inserted into billing envelopes as a way to cajole payments from debtors after two or three months of unpaid bills. Today these "friendly reminders" provide a nostalgic look at the mores and manners of an earlier time.  </p><list type="deflist"><head>Historical Note</head><defitem><label>Product Labels</label><item>While the practice of utilizing printed labels is as old as printing itself, modern package design did not begin to evolve until after the Civil War when advancements in printing, paper production and chromolithography made the affordable mass production of elaborate and colorful designs possible.

While initially constructed of materials such as silk and ribbon, the first commercial reference to hairnets made of human hair appeared in July, 1863, as an editorial feature in Peterson's Magazine (Vol. XLIV, No. 1). By 1914, the hairnet was a common hair accessory for women, and over the ensuing years became increasingly promoted for use in the nursing and food service professions. The emancipated bobbed hairstyles of the 1920s brought a temporary decline in the use of hairnets. Their popularity was revived by World War II, a period which saw the return of longer hairstyles and the entrance of women into the industrial workforce. Further refinements to hairnet manufacturing included the introduction of Du Pont's multifilament nylon yarn in 1940, offering unprecedented resiliency and wear.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref149_1s5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hairnets in Packaging</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1910s-1960s</unitdate><container id="aspace_f775746c256549c7f16d00299c1baa90" label="Graphic Materials [1804000030022]" type="Offsite-Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_f775746c256549c7f16d00299c1baa90" type="Folder">95</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref150_98v" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hairnets in Packaging</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1940s-1960s</unitdate><container id="aspace_f939fac8e864755a6c5690449a5c54b9" label="Graphic Materials [1804000030022]" type="Offsite-Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_f939fac8e864755a6c5690449a5c54b9" type="Folder">96</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref188_yxs" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series X.

Over the course of the 19th century, a variety of advancements in technology such as lithography, the paper making machine, and the invention of duplex paper, made the affordable mass production of decals possible. The introduction of silk screen printing in the early 20th century allowed a top-coat or cover-coat of lacquer to be added to the decal design (so-called water-mount decals) which could be transferred when wet.</p><p>Introduced to the United States by approximately 1865, the demand for decals reached its zenith in the 1870s resulting in what came to be called "decalcomania."  Decals remain popular today offering an inexpensive way to decorate and enhance a variety of objects and surfaces.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref189_7hl" level="file"><did><unittitle>Star Cal --

In August, 1941, President D. Roosevelt created the Office of Price Administration (OPA) in order to regulate both the purchase and cost of consumer goods during a period of severely limited imports and wartime shortages. By the spring of 1942, the first of 4 series of War Ration Books and stamps or "points" were issued to each American family.

In 1941, a Sub-Committee on Music was established by the Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation to advise the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps on matters relating to musical activities and entertainment for servicemen both in and outside military camps and reservations from 1941-1946. A popular part of this program began in 1943 with the monthly issuing of pamphlet-size songbooks called "Army Navy Hit Kits" containing the lyrics and music of popular songs of the period, including both "Hit Parade" and patriotic-themed songs.

During World War II, American government officials successfully harnessed the use of propaganda through the poster medium in an effort to mobilize the nation towards a united and urgent support for the war effort and American victory. A major function of the Office of War Information (OWI), created in 1942, was responsibility for controlling the content and imagery of war posters, and ensuring their monthly distribution and promotion across the nation. Drawing from the powerful and persuasive stylistic conventions of the advertising industry, American home front posters embraced American consciousness with themes that emphasized the nature of the enemy, the nature of the allies, the need to work, fight, and sacrifice, and the need to protect the principles of American freedom.</p><p>See also: Greeting Cards, Postcards, Sheet Music, and Posters</p><p><emph render="bold">Ration Books and OPA Points:</emph>
In August, 1941, President D. Roosevelt created the Office Price Administration (O.P.A.) in order to regulate both the purchase and cost of consumer goods during a period of severely limited imports and wartime shortages. By the spring of 1942, the first of 4 series of War Ration Books and stamps or "points" were issued to each American family. The program served as a way to promote the "fair share of certain goods made short by war," and carefully control the amount of foods, necessities, and luxuries any one person could buy. For the average citizen, such daily sacrifice represented a challenging but essential and patriotic contribution to the American war effort. </p><p><emph render="bold">Army Navy Hit Kit Songs:</emph>

By the end of the decade, linoleum was introduced to the United States, with the first US-based production beginning in 1874. Affordable, attractive, and resilient, as well as naturally bactericidal, flame and scratch-resistant, linoleum became a favorite surface material in American homes and hospitals, offering vibrant colors and myriad of creative patterns that included imitation marble, stone, mosaics, and faux carpeting designs. Lighter gauge linoleum was also created for use on walls, including Lincrusta (Lincrusta-Walton), Linowall (Armstrong), and Sealex Wall-Covering and Congowall (Congoleum).</p><p>By the 1930s, Armstrong was the largest manufacturer of linoleum in the America, offering consumers hundreds of patterns from which to choose. Linoleum manufacturers published "pattern books" to advertise their designs, and offered homemakers free booklets with illustrated advice for incorporating linoleum into their interior decorating schemes.</p><p>In the years following World War II, the introduction of cheaper PVC (vinyl) flooring brought the use of linoleum into sharp decline.  Today, patterned linoleum is enjoying renewed popularity as a "green" recyclable flooring alternative that is environmentally friendly and biodegradable. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref214_blh"

Today, sheet music is a particularly valuable form of ephemera, with its text and pictorial covers offering keen insight into contemporary pastimes and the societal and racial attitudes of their eras. In the 1840s, such pictorial covers were characterized by simple black and white designs often incorporating ornamental scrollwork and simple lettering, and were commonly reproduced with woodcuts, steel engraving, and lithography. Advances in color printing technology (chromolithography) by the end of the 19th century brought about an increased focus on illustrated covers, which became a successful vehicle for commercial artists. As the Industrial Revolution gave rise to prosperity and the growth of the middle classes, Americans found themselves with increased time for leisure activities, which included the home piano as a popular form of entertainment. In America, the production and popularity of sheet music would reach its heyday in the late 19th century, with the rise of Tin Pan Alley and the American music publishing industry. Over the ensuing decades, demand for sheet music would gradually lessen in importance with the introduction of the phonograph and radio, and the advent of the record industry.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_8e758bd9b9ead6bb46b62e1a9c6d88c7"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>The thematic groups in the series list below were previously arranged by the collector, with category titles assigned by N-YHS.

More than any other form of pictorial representation, photography is inextricably tied to remembrance and its invention forever changed the way we relate with and document our world. Following closely on the heels of photography's introduction was the practice of postmortem photography, which, after 1841, spread across America becoming prevalent in both urban and rural areas, and remained culturally embraced well into the early 20th century. From 1840-1880, the majority of postmortem images were taken within the private home, where the body was posed naturalistically. While sometimes depicted as if alive and awake, very often the deceased were shown as if to be sleeping peacefully rather than dead, an illusion that gently denies death, while at the same time serving to beautify, soften, and romanticize it. By the latter 19th century, with the rise of the funeral and embalming industries, straightforward full length "casket photographs" became very popular, focusing less on the individual, and more on the social aspect of the funeral event or funeral parlor setting (where the corpse was often upstaged by profuse floral arrangements). </p><p>Today these images serve as culturally bound artifacts that provide a trace of the sociocultural importance that such image making had for their producers and users. Photographs of a deceased loved one functioned as icons, substitutes, and reminders of loss. Most importantly, they captured memory by recording for posterity a lasting image of the deceased.</p><p><emph render="bold">Salamagundi Club, NYC, May 5, 1945:</emph>
