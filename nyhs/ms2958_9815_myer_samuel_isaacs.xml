    <abstract id="aspace_2cb1cefe084a6a9df0b959f20bf0f6e0">Seven letters (1896-1902) to Myer S. Isaacs and 18 letters (1913-1953, undated) to Stanley M. Isaacs. Four of the letters to Myer are from Jacob A. Riis. In these letters, with salutations to "My dear Judge," Riis bemoans the political power of Tammany Hall and expresses low expectations of New York City Mayor-elect Robert A. Van Wyck (1897); mentions his meeting with the Colonel (likely Theodore Roosevelt) and conveys expressions of friendship to Isaacs from Roosevelt (1898); indicates he will be returning to his work soon and expresses disappointment that the Governor (Roosevelt) selected [James Armstrong] Blanchard, rather than Myer, for a judgeship (1900); and wishes Myer well in recovering from an illness or other setback, extolling his importance and cheer in fighting against slums. Riis also notes the severe decline in health of his mother, age 79, in Denmark (1902).<lb/> 

<lb/>In the other three letters to Myer Isaacs, New York Governor-elect Frank S. Black thanks him for his note of congratulations (1896); New York City Mayor William L. Strong appoints Myer to a committee, chaired by Abram S. Hewitt, to select sites for small parks (1897); and New York Governor Benjamin B. Odell, Jr. thanks him for his message of congratulations, presumably for Odell's nomination as Republican Party candidate for a second gubernatorial term (1902).<lb/> 

<lb/>In the letters to Stanley M. Isaacs, Francis W. Bird (former New York County Progressive Party chairman) compliments Isaacs on persuading Linden to take the chairmanship, expresses satisfaction with being in Boston(?), but notes it was hard to leave New York (March 7); Joseph Bucklin Bishop acknowledges Isaac's letter regarding errors in Bishop's book about Theodore Roosevelt and explains them (1920); Charles J. Bonaparte acknowledges a request and indicates he will need to examine his correspondence of the past five years to determine if he can satisfy the request (undated); Richard Derby returns box tickets to Isaacs, indicating that he cannot use them and hoping some of Isaac's constituents will be able to (1914); Ethel (Mrs. Richard) Derby thanks Isaacs for his letter, apparently on the occasion of her mother's death (1948); letters from John Grier Hibben (President of Princeton University), Alexander Lambert, Albert Shaw (Editor of The American Review of Reviews), and E.A. Van Valkenberg agreeing to autograph Stanley's copy of a volume about Theodore Roosevelt (1925-26); William l. Miller agrees that the Governor's financial program is subject to attack but he had too many issues to address other than that, though Miller might return to the matter (undated); John Purroy Mitchel thanks Stanley for his congratulations (1913); Joseph Murray recalls with pride the days of the Progressive Party and the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, and recalls Myer Isaacs as an honorable man (1925); Linden(?) writes from Lima, Peru, with congratulations and comment on the political situation in that country, with mobs, a coup d'etat, and death threats (undated); A. [Amos] Pinchot notes the arrangement for a chairmanship is satisfactory with him and refers to Bird (Sept 5); Gifford Pinchot thanks Isaacs for his letter and hopes to "measure up" to the "size of the new job" (1922); Theodore Douglas Robinson thanks Isaacs for his congratulations on becoming Assistant Secretary in the Navy Department (1924); Edith Kermit Roosevelt transmits one of only three of Theodore Roosevelt's remaining bookplates, along with one of hers (1926, with two bookplates and envelope signed by Edith Roosevelt); and W.A. White (Editor of the Emporia Gazette) agrees with Stanley that the trouble with the progressive situation is organization, but that you first need "an idea to form the crystal" (1921).<lb/>

<lb/>In addition there is a print portrait of Charles Evans Hughes signed and inscribed by Hughes to Isaacs (1925); an admission ticket to the Progressive Mass Meeting at the Central Opera House, with annotation that Stanley Isaacs presided (1914 October 30); the first day of issue 3 cents Sagamore Hill stamp, sent on September 14, 1953, from Oyster Bay on Stanley Isaacs stationery to himself; and a typescript poem "Roosevelt Men" signed by Arthur Guiterman (1929 January 6). <lb/>
