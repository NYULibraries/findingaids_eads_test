The collection is especially rich in author contract summaries, profit/loss calculations for individual titles, printing histories and inventories of titles, and book catalogues. Although books in the collection extend back to 1720 and through the 1800s, the bulk of the collection are business records and these date primarily from the 1890s and into the 1970s, with a few earlier and later.</abstract>

<p>This collection includes some of the records of Dodd, Mead &amp; Company. The company was founded in 1839 by Moses Woodruff Dodd and John S. Taylor as a publisher of mostly religiously focused texts, commentaries, and sermons. Over time the partners of the Dodd family shifted and the company was reorganized twice before becoming Dodd, Mead &amp; Company in 1876 under Frank Howard Dodd, Edward S. Mead (Dodd's cousin), and Bleeker Van Wagenen. The breadth of their publications also expanded to include contemporary fiction, how to books, encyclopedias (The International Encyclopedia Company was a subsidiary), poetry, historical nonfiction, and many international titles among others. In the 1920s-30s Dodd, Mead expanded, buying several smaller publishing companies. The company was bought as a subsidiary by Thomas Nelson Inc. in 1981, bought again by Gamut Publishing Company in 1986, and finally ceased operations in 1990.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Dodd, Mead &amp; Company collection consists of administrative records, financial records, publicity materials, and publication records. The administrative records include operating files such as board minutes, insurance policies, and salaries. The financial records include mostly stock books, financial reports, and analyses of profits, losses, and operating costs. Publicity materials include catalogues, brochures, and photographs of authors. Publication records consist mostly of copyright cards and other internal documentation related to the company's published works. These records expose the points of expansion within the company and reveal the reorganization and restructuring the company underwent as they evolved and technology progressed. The documents also include many family photographs and miscellaneous clippings and other documents that provide insight into the style and accomplishments of Dodd, Mead's leadership over time. There are also many books from the 19th century (and a few from the 18th century), mostly religious books Dodd, Mead published.</p>  </scopecontent>

The subseries features calculations of profit and loss by individual title, beginning with 1876 and ranging without gaps into the late 1950s; these annual analyses were referred to as "red books" because of the color of the binding used until 1944 (later years are on loose sheets, but retained the appellation). Also featured are inventories ranging from the 1940s to the 1970s. A number of miscellaneous financial matters close the subseries, among them royalty statements, securities transactions (investments) in the 1930s, copies of Dodd, Mead's billings for royalties, fees, and other payments due them, and other items.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_d6dae45e66d3832fb5b3219323081ad7"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged by format/subject, then chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_183d1ad962d62880e700101060328621" level="file"><did><unittitle>General Analysis</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1903-1908</unitdate><container id="aspace_e36dd2931578eef514a14cd61d6c72b2" label="Mixed Materials [1804000013614]" type="Offsite-Box">18</container><container parent="aspace_e36dd2931578eef514a14cd61d6c72b2" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_4e8f8bb58f4d6103871a2ab2139c5324" level="file"><did><unittitle>Monthly Financial Reports (7 folders)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1935-1949</unitdate><container id="aspace_ebfb1eaaf4744ed64e6bb90723746596" label="Mixed Materials [1804000013614]" type="Offsite-Box">18</container><container parent="aspace_ebfb1eaaf4744ed64e6bb90723746596" type="Folder">4-10</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1a5ff480b87c8d2700f9775b54bb7d3a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>There are gaps in the date range.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9231eb88e15b609b64c34d70d26b4806" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Red Books" (Profits and Losses by Title) (10 volumes)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1876-1944</unitdate><container id="aspace_073d015df3a03bb9aa3eff297e7ee1dd" label="Mixed Materials [1804000013829]" type="Offsite-Box">34</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1fba556b43da336d1901816ebd023982"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The box holds nine books with a complete run from 1876-1944 of profit/loss analysis by book title.

This includes mostly catalogues and pamphlets as well as colophons and other printing materials. Among the catalogues, there are several standalone pamphlets that advertise a specific genre or collection (such as college textbooks). There are also several yearly catalogues that were all originally organized together and remain as such. These yearly catalogues include both Dodd, Mead and other publishing companies that were either subsidiaries or acquisitions of Dodd, Mead. There are also sets of bound catalogues that span several years and are inclusive of all the smaller catalogues that Dodd, Mead produced during that time period.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_1dd7922b60694a4a1e6a8674ad988f37"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged by format then chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_c357cd62d188e794a56d77fa58b9eedd" level="file"><did><unittitle>"A Selected List of New Books for the Holidays" Seasonal Catalogue and Promotional Material</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1917</unitdate><container id="aspace_d8ec89b8c1ddc8d999b0b439a7c7a321" label="Mixed Materials [1804000013846]" type="Offsite-Box">51</container><container parent="aspace_d8ec89b8c1ddc8d999b0b439a7c7a321" type="Folder">39</container></did></c><c id="aspace_603bc6f8ebe814046a83eb2a36c2a214" level="file"><did><unittitle>Publicity Brochures</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1974</unitdate><container id="aspace_6051319c1bae86478e9fcefa19cb201e" label="Mixed Materials [1804000013846]" type="Offsite-Box">51</container><container parent="aspace_6051319c1bae86478e9fcefa19cb201e" type="Folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fc231531409609899d366c940c59f908"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes the following: Cover design and table of contents for "Black Politics" by Ernest Patterson and for "The American Democratic System" by J.

(The contracts themselves are not in the collection.) There are some variations in the pre-printed forms used, with one used until about 1920, then another used through the end of the date range. The earlier form has somewhat less data fields than the later form. Overall, though, the summaries allow for various data including basic description (e.g., number of words/length, format, date of publication, dates contract was sent and the signed copy received, etc.); compensation data (royalties and payment terms, advance information, price of publication, etc.); and rights information (name under copyright, serial rights ownership, publication plans, international (including Canadian) rights, media rights, use of illustrations, etc.). Although the pre-printed cards include these fields and others for granular detail, only those fields relevant to a contract are completed.</p><p>The cards are in three sets, with the first two similar in content, differing only in that they generally relate to different time periods. The bulk dates of the first are 1890s to 1930s and the second set are 1930s to 1970s, but there is overlap. The third set also summarizes contracts, but appears to be oriented more to royalties and other payments related to reprintings, with notes on actual payments.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_41eca8f5547ef9874b1449ca297c8d16"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged by the three sets noted above.

The books in this series largely have a religious focus and most, though not all (some date to the 1700s), were published by Dodd, Mead in their first few decades. Most of the books include a name, inscription, or other markings on a flyleaf or other front page. These tend to suggest that many of these books were acquired secondhand, such as through used book stores. A couple were inscribed with the name Stephen Dodd and these were noted in the container list.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_b6e6338060275c286fbfb1d3dbca4441"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically by author.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_d65bcc36cb9ef25a953da462d56e7da8" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Memoir and Sermons" by Reverend Wm.
