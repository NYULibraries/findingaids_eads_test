<p>The record group is organized in several series that coincide with the executive administrations of N-YHS. Each series will be opened over time consistent with N-YHS's policy on access to Board and executive records. Only the first two series are currently open to researchers:</p><p>Series I. Board Minutes (1939-1958)</p><p>Series II. Official Papers (1939-1959)</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Access Restrictions</head>
<p>N-YHS generally restricts the records of the Board of Trustees and the Executive Office for fifty years following the conclusion of the tenure of a President and CEO (formerly, Director). Accordingly, the record group is open through 1959, when Director R.W.G. Vail left N-YHS. The tenure of his successor, James Heslin, dated from 1960 to 1982, so those records are closed until 2033. Records from subsequent administrations will be opened in later decades.</p><p>Materials in this collection may be stored offsite.

<p>In November 1937, a by-law change resulted in the creation of an independent Board of Trustees as the governing body of N-YHS. The New-York Historical Society Board of Trustee records (NYHS-RG 18) primarily includes the materials related to Board meetings, including agendas, minutes, committee reports, various documents distributed at the meetings, and some working files from 1939 forward (the 1938 minutes are found in a different record group; see the Related Materials note).  Records from after 1959 are currently restricted (see the Access Restrictions note).</p>  </scopecontent>

Nonetheless, the official papers do hold additional material of interest including budgeting worksheets, expense details, attendance sheets, staff notices, staff lists, and other matter. The official papers of the early 1940s hold some documents related to N-YHS's wartime precautionary measures.
