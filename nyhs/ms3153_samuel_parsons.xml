    <abstract id="aspace_b5553377a0388a14ad8c20a59cc8a062">The collection includes a variety of documents related to landscape architect Samuel B. Parsons Jr. (1844-1923). The documents principally concern his involvement with New York City's Parks Department and Central Park, for which he was Superintendent of Planting under Calvert Vaux and later Landscape Architect (from about 1880-1911). There are also several corporate records of the privately-held firms Samuel Parsons &amp; Sons and Samuel Parsons, Inc. In connection with Central Park, the collection holds photographs and diagrams related to the restoration of elm trees on the Mall, a typescript of testimony taken during Raymond B. Fosdick's 1911 investigation into the Parks Department accounts, a draft resolution of exoneration of Parsons by the Parks Board, and a scrapbook and manuscript "memories," both of which largely concern the Park. In addition the collection also holds several letters from Parsons written to his father while the son was in service during the Civil War with the U.S. Sanitary Commission; a lecture by Parsons with suggestions for landscaping a country home; published works by Parsons; a volume of extracts taken by Parsons of books he read; genealogical notes; photographs of the grounds of various estates; and other documents.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Samuel Bowne Parsons Jr. (1844-1923) was a landscape architect who, most relevant to this collection, was responsible as Superintendent of Planting and later Landscape Architect for the New York City Parks Department from about 1880 to 1911. In that post he was engaged especially with Central Park and was consequently embroiled in many disputes over the appropriate usage and development of the Park, which eventually led to his removal as Landscape Architect.</p><p>Parsons's grandfather was a horticulturalist and founded a nursery in Flushing, Queens, Long Island around 1840. That business was known as Samuel Parsons &amp; Sons (one of the sons being Parsons's father) and was handed down through the family until its dissolution about 1907. Parsons learned the trade as a youngster before serving with the U.S. Sanitary Commission during the Civil War and then graduating from the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale in 1865. He moved out on his own, buying a farm, and developing his skills as a landscape architect. He came into the orbit of Calvert Vaux (1824-1895) and, when Vaux became Landscape Architect for the New York City Parks Department in 1880, he had Parsons named Superintendent of Planting. After Vaux's death, Parsons replaced him as Landscape Architect until 1911. Aside from his official New York City responsibilities, Parsons also worked on other projects during and after his tenure, including the design of Balboa Park in San Diego around 1902.</p><p>Parsons married Martha Francis in 1865 and they had a daughter, Mabel. Mabel briefly carried on Parsons's business after his death and published a book of the "memories" he had drafted late in his life. Parsons died in 1923 at his home in the San Remo apartments, on Central Park West, directly across the street from the Park. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.</p>  </bioghist>

Writing from Washington, Sharpsburg, Harpers Ferry, and New Bern (North Carolina), Parsons makes various observations on the conditions of the soldiers and the management of the Commission's operation. He also notes various positive impressions of Frederick Olmsted. The folder also includes two items possibly by Parsons: an essay about German poet Ulrich von Hutten (1488-1523) and a fictional(?) tale of a woman's near drowning while ice skating in Central Park that (spoiler alert) leads to marriage with her rescuer. Also two letters to Parsons from a friend, Lieutenant Henry V.D. Stone of the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry, writing in 1863 from Virginia, and a letter from Stone's brother informing Parson's of Stone's death at Gettysburg. Also, a letter from Clarence (Clarence R. King according to the donor), written from the Sierra Nevada and discussing King's increased spirituality; "the Bishop of Oxford's puzzle"; and a poem to S.P by M.P (1864).</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ceb99e0aaa1651955b0ae65dd85fc350" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Dedication Ode" by Parsons</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_74236858f9f611182aa7cb65d5166962" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_74236858f9f611182aa7cb65d5166962" type="Folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_845a48a8f73be6fd026b1c0b0c0769c0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Although the specific context is unidentified, it appears to be the dedication of a cemetery or other burial site.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_eb71ea36b6b3b9aa92d4140553c3d000" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The most promising new hardy ornamental trees and shrubs, and their most tasteful and effective arrangement" by Parsons</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1880</unitdate><container id="aspace_c06d2393f60fd56bc1ba766f2ae98cfc" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_c06d2393f60fd56bc1ba766f2ae98cfc" type="Folder">3</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_271320b91f68e077b65e4121b8734723"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Printed copies of Parsons's prize essay delivered before the Massachusetts Horticultural Society.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0011e83bc38d51cb394ca485c7c6bbbf" level="file"><did><unittitle>List of "Maps and studies of parks in the borough of Manhattan by Samuel Parsons"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_e657a30856753917d435ad7ab8ea015b" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_e657a30856753917d435ad7ab8ea015b" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_2f0c795432e0591f82c3014260948f53" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Saw the city [San Diego] from Point Loma"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1902</unitdate><container id="aspace_d80cdced721997bb96a41750822ba7ef" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_d80cdced721997bb96a41750822ba7ef" type="Folder">5</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_521a9b0baf58a1d0c1517471b1dade1c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Newspaper clipping of an article written by Parsons describing his drive with Mr. Marston to Point Loma.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_73613be37ed68b84ff16b8ced4a79955" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Memories of Samuel Parsons," typescript, with edits by Mabel Parsons</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1918?-1924</unitdate><container id="aspace_1b7de84687f37484782d2c7555dfbb44" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_1b7de84687f37484782d2c7555dfbb44" type="Folder">6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3808f0ea944ba51e5e201a44c618ac0f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Typescript of approximately 146 pages that is likely a manuscript of the book published by Mabel Parsons in 1924. It is missing the first two pages and an unknown number at the end (missing pages were not in the papers when they were donated to N-YHS). The subject matter primarily concerns Central Park and Parsons's memoirs of his involvement with the Park beginning about 1880 as Superintendent of Planting and later Superintendent of Parks. He describes his relationship with and favorable impressions of Calvert Vaux; his opinions of the various successful and unsuccessful attempts to add sculpture and other ornamentation and facilities to Central Park (e.g., racetrack, Metropolitan Museum of Art, zoo/menagerie, a bid for a World's Fair, etc.); observations and disagreements about landscaping and his efforts to improve the Park; the contributions of Mrs. Russell Sage, Andrew Green, and others to the Park; placement of the St. Gaudens statue of General Sherman; and the efforts to remove him from office. There is also a chapter on Morningside Park and on Parsons's observations of parks during a European tour.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9b617ea5d29f4a3ca526e8f94fe5ff10" level="file"><did><unittitle>"An old vlissengen farm: The quaint Quaker house that John Bowne built for his wife in 1661"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1880s?</unitdate><container id="aspace_bc9fd35d80334360450805fc5b0e1b38" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_bc9fd35d80334360450805fc5b0e1b38" type="Folder">7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_90f7890282fe327bcf2d52f86e4ed541"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes a 3 page description of the "family house" at Flushing, Queens, Long Island, likely written by Parsons.
