    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The World War II Photograph Collection spans the period from 1941 to 1948 and includes promotional material from the United States War Department, the vast majority from the U.S. Navy. Photos are arranged alphabetically by creating agency and thereunder by subject. The collection includes approximately 2,000 black and white, 8 x 10" photographs and several smaller prints.</p><p>During processing, this material was removed from the Subject File. Members and equipment of the U. S. Navy, U.S. Army Air Force, and U. S. Coast Guard are shown. American pluck is a key feature of the photographs. Most photos have press information or narrative detail on the verso or on papers attached to the photo. The photos and their accompanying text give an idea of the breadth and message of the public relations campaign in America to encourage support for the war. Dates listed are the release date of the photos which, in the case of battles, was often several months after the event. In some instances groups of photos were released to commemorate important events. For example, a group of pictures showing the recovered ships sunk at Pearl Harbor was released in December 1942 for the one-year anniversary of the attack. </p><p>United States troops are seen in many different situations. Battle scenes mainly focus on bombing raids and burning ships in the Pacific arena. Italian POWS at a camp in New Jersey are shown. Both the German and Japanese surrenders are shown. Photos also include many U.S. ships involved in the war. The launching of battleships and aircraft carriers are well documented, as is the salvage of the cruise ship Normandie and its subsequent refitting as the U.S.S. Lafayette. Sailor life on board several ships, including the U.S.S. Missouri, is also shown. Some aerial views, once considered confidential, of ships in New York Harbor are contained in the U.S. Army Eastern Defense Command folders. Several New York area Naval Commandants are pictured, as well as many enlisted men at several different training facilities.</p><p>Women are displayed at work in many of these photos. Navy WAVES are shown readying themselves for battle as well as enjoying leisure activities. Photos of the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn highlight women working as machinists and welders.</p><p>Throughout the collection, named subjects are filed first, and then miscellaneous photos are filed by date. In some cases, miscellaneous photos may complement the subjects in named series or folders; in these cases "see also" references have been given in the container listing.</p>  </scopecontent>

Often, the Navy-assigned titles sound ready for newspaper headlines. Some titles may seem to have no relationship to the photos to those unfamiliar with military terminology. "Baby Flat Top -- The Navy's Child Prodigy" is the title of a photo series showing life aboard an aircraft carrier. In "Shakedown," new recruits are taken on a practice mission in order to learn how to take care of a ship and to "get their sea legs."</p><p>Most of the photographs highlight the Pacific theatre of war. Battles shown or highlighted (sometimes including the aftermath) include: the invasion of Borneo, Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Guadalcanal, the Makin Island Raid, the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of the Solomon Islands, the Battle of Santa Cruz Island, and the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Navy troops are shown in Borneo, the Philippines (the subject of many photos taken throughout 1944 and 1945), Formosa, New Zealand, Guam, Saipan, New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands. Other photographs show Navy Combat Troops landing at Attu in the Aleutian Islands.</p><p>Photos showing the European front are mainly of Italy and North Africa, including "Operation Bootstrap" to liberate Italy. Photographs of Italy, including several titled "British fighting in Sicily" (folder 96), show "Naples in Ruins,"( folder 98) and troops landing in Anzio, Italy. Other European photographs include "U.S. Navy Crosses the Rhine" (folder 106), and others showing Le Havre, Brest, (folder 103), and beachheads throughout France (folder 102). </p><p>Women are the subject of many photographs and photographic series. Women at work in the New York Navy Yard get much attention, as do the WAVES, the Navy's Auxiliary force for women. WAVES are seen in church, on deck of a ship (sunbathing, while sailors look on), "at chow," and in their summer uniforms. Folder 95 contains a photo of Madame Chiang Kai Chek reviewing WAVES at a New York training academy. Folder 102 shows Eleanor Roosevelt reviewing a group of WAVES. </p><p>The New York Navy Yard (also known popularly as Brooklyn Navy Yard) is prominently featured in many photographs. The Navy Yard's activities peaked around October of 1944, with employment of over 70,000 workers working around the clock to build and repair ships for the United States Navy. The yard was made up of 6 dry docks, 2 building ways, 8 piers, 270 buildings, 19 miles of paved streets, and 30 miles of railroad tracks. Many ships launched from the Navy Yard are shown here, and several photo series show employees hard at work. One interesting photograph shows a visit by the Regent of Iraq to the New York Navy Yard (Folder 107.)</p><p>Military technology and weaponry dominate the Naval photographs. Many photos of the U.S. Ships were taken up to 20 years after the end of the war. A large number of these photographs are not marked with the name of the ship. However, ships shown during wartime are well-documented and described on the verso of the photographs. Aircraft carriers are pictured in Folders 95, 98, 99, and 108. A model aircraft carrier is shown on display at Rockefeller Center in New York in Folder 107. "Helldivers," or bombing planes, are shown in folders 98. "Avengers," torpedo bombers, are shown in Folders 98, 101, and 105. "Hellcats," another bombing plane, appear in Folder 97.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref32_nvl" level="file"><did><unittitle>[Aerial Views of New York Harbor]</unittitle><unitdate

Several folders of personal photographs are included in the collection. Sixteen snapshots of the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps were taken by a veteran who was present at the freeing of those camps in April 1945. Nine snapshots show Gerhardt Walter, the photographs' donor, in New Guinea in 1945. Eleven snapshots show New York City "dressed for war" with victory banners and flags hung from buildings and across streets, displays of unrationed food, and people in uniform.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref88_akz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Civilian Defense Volunteer Organization</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_849ca560fedefc1e4c71b60953299ee9" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_849ca560fedefc1e4c71b60953299ee9" type="Folder">118-119</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref89_xd8" level="file"><did><unittitle>German Concentration Camps</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[1945 Apr.]</unitdate><container id="aspace_0d7ff38c1f8a28b683106aa52ad448f4" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_0d7ff38c1f8a28b683106aa52ad448f4" type="Folder">120</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref90_116" level="file"><did><unittitle>Italian POW's</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_fe06c125fa833e7ae824f200b3e7bf34" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_fe06c125fa833e7ae824f200b3e7bf34" type="Folder">121</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref91_urk" level="file"><did><unittitle>Japanese Surrender</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1945/1945" type="inclusive">[1945]</unitdate><container id="aspace_9f8c7c5d2d9eebb13bc67979981d9252" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_9f8c7c5d2d9eebb13bc67979981d9252" type="Folder">122</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref92_g4c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Miscellaneous Photos</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_a8eaca6bb051e690500f6c1571c78f5a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_a8eaca6bb051e690500f6c1571c78f5a" type="Folder">123-124</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref93_ycm" level="file"><did><unittitle>Miscellaneous--Snapshots</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1942/1945" type="inclusive">1942-1945, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_08c9cd9bbccd15ad988e93351d2857ac" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_08c9cd9bbccd15ad988e93351d2857ac" type="Folder">125-127</container></did></c></c></dsc>
