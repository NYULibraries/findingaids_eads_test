    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Emma Thursby Papers consist of material relating to the life and singing career of Emma Cecilia Thursby, as well as the lives of members of her extended family. Included are letters, telegrams, postcards, address books, diaries, engagement books, autographs, calling cards; financial materials including receipts, bills, checkbook stubs, letters of credit; legal papers such as contracts, wills, indentures, and deeds; poetry, programs, periodical clippings, passports, notes, and a few photographs. The collection effectively documents the financial and career dealings of a renowned concert singer in the late nineteenth century. Emma Thursby traveled to many European countries, as well as to Japan and China, both for her career and for pleasure, and most of these trips are well documented. In addition, the many family letters included show the close family network of siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins that nurtured Emma Thursby.</p><p>The bulk of the collection is composed of the Correspondence and the Subjects series. Letters from Ina Thursby to other family members from her travels with Emma provide detailed information on Emma's concert dates, performances, travel, and voice study. The Subjects series highlights Emma's interests after her own singing career had ended such as Eastern religious philosophies or the salons she held every Friday. Specific information about legal and financial aspects of Emma Thursby's career can be found in the Financial or Legal series, but neither of these aspects is as complete a document of her experience as can be found through correspondence.</p>  </scopecontent>

The series contains information about important events (mainly deaths) in the lives of the Thursby family members, offers and requests for Emma Thursby to perform, Emma Thursby's participation in the philosophical community Green Acre in Eliot, Maine, and European travelogues and concert reports. This series consists of letters, telegrams, postcards, calling cards, envelopes, and stationery.</p><p>In all her travels Emma Thursby was accompanied by a close family member, perhaps both in the role of chaperone and companion. Her older sister Alice accompanied her on the first tours, and both her mother and Alice went along to Europe in 1878. Emma's younger sister Ina came on this particular trip for only a few months, but would soon accompany Emma on all tours and become her closest companion and confidante. During these later tours it is Ina's letters to the family and friends back in Brooklyn which provide much of the information about the concerts performed, receptions received, friends met, spas visited, and sights seen throughout the years.</p><p>Each correspondence subseries is divided into incoming and outgoing material. Letters are arranged alphabetically by the recipient or sender's name and then chronologically for each person. Correspondents with ten or more letters have separate folders. In addition, correspondents who comprised an entire envelope in the original housing system have been given an individual folder. A few separate folders were also created for important correspondents (such as the Paris Opera) regardless of number of letters.</p><p>Many Thursby family letters are addressed to more than one person (i.e. "Mother, Allie and Lou.") In these cases, the letters have been assigned to the folder of the oldest family member. A letter to "Allie, Lou and John" would be filed under Alice Thursby (the order of children was Alice, Emma, John, Louis, and Ina). Family letters addressed to "Dear sisters" are filed under Emma Thursby. </p><p>For the most part, envelopes are housed with their letters, either inside a card, in an acid-free paper sling, or, if easily identifiable as belonging to the letter, behind the letter. Envelopes that could not be matched to a specific letter are housed in Subseries 8, Other Correspondence.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref15_odi" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 1: Emma Thursby</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1859-1931</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_22f61ce0d36bafa29c5f93452cd40b27"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>The correspondence in this subseries dates from Emma Thursby's days at music school in Pennsylvania as a young girl, and continues until a few days before her death. Her letters to her family from her travels abroad detail her musical education, career, and burgeoning social life on the European continent. Letters to friends such as Sara Bull and her cousin Mary Elizabeth (Mollie) Bennett Comfort also contain thoughts on her life outside her career, and philosophical interests such as Eastern religion. </p><p>Letters from pupils attest to Emma Thursby's popularity as a voice teacher. These letters, most of which are mainly devoted to requesting or confirming dates of lessons, were foldered separately at the time of the accession of the collection, and so have been kept segregated from the other correspondence. Many of Emma Thursby's voice students went on to become operatic or concert stars in their own right; correspondence from these women is contained in Series 6, Subject and Biographical Information; Subseries 1, Emma Thursby. Emma and/or Ina Thursby seems to have kept a file on each of these women, evidenced by the number of clippings and programs kept with these women's correspondence.</p><p>General alphabetical files of correspondence include letters from the following people: Edward Bok, Ole Bull, President Grover Cleveland and family, Count Chinda, Isadora Duncan, P.S. Gilmore, Percy Grainger, Phoebe Hearst, Mrs. Warren Harding, Herman Marcuse, Julia Marlowe, Kate Willard Parker, John D. Rockefeller, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Nicola Tesla, Mark Twain, David Todd, and [Swami] Vivekananda. Letters date from Emma Thursby's entire career, and are both letters of adulation as well as personal correspondence. Performers and pupils represented are Regina Arta (aka Emma Loeffler,) Dula Drake, Emma Eames, Blanche Marchesi, Emma Nevada Palmer, Duchess de Richelieu, Erminia Rudersdorff, and Maurice Strakosch and family. Corresponding institutions (often letters of thanks for concerts given) include Bushwick Reformed Church, <title type="simple" render="italic">Etude </title>magazine, Methodist Episcopal Church South, <title type="simple" render="italic">Musician </title>magazine, Old Bushwick Church, Peabody House for Aged and Indigent Women, and Plymouth Church.</p><p>Many letters are addressed to both Emma and Ina Thursby. These letters, as well as those addressed to "Miss Thursby" have been filed in this subseries, unless clearly identified (based on information in the letter or on original envelope housing) to belong to Ina Thursby.</p><p>The four volumes are red cases labeled "A -- G," "H -- M," "N -- R," and "S -- Z" and contain letters written to Emma Thursby between 1871 and 1910. These letters were item-level cataloged at the time of their accession; a complete listing is available at the reference desk. Some of the correspondents included here (Edward Bok, Sara Bull, Olea Bull, Sarah Farmer, Patrick Gilmore, May Jackson, Jeannie Ovington, Maurice Strakosch, Maggie Van Cott, and [Swami] Vivekananda) also are represented in Boxes 1 -- 5. However, most of these letters were from one-time correspondents. The topics range from thanks given for complimentary concert tickets, to sympathy at the death of Thursby family members. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref16_7aw" level="file"><did><unittitle>Emma

Bills for household goods and some small loan documentation are in the folder, "Financial Papers: Thursby, Jane B. and John B," as are ledgers detailing the daily pay of John B. Thursby's employees. These materials document the kinds of mercantile transactions common in Williamsburgh and Bushwick during the middle of the nineteenth century, as well as create an idea of the costs involved in running the class of household Jane Thursby attempted. </p><p>Financial papers of the Van Cott and Bennet families, Emma Thursby's maternal grandparents and relatives, are included in this series. These papers date from as early as 1706 and contain receipts and bills of sale, examples of quotidian life from Williamsburgh and Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York. Two indentures and a pardon have been separated to the oversize folder.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref119_0l4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Thursby, Emma</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1875/1885" type="inclusive">1875-1885</unitdate><container id="aspace_5614ef1a371839bf7f3276d50fd21365" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_5614ef1a371839bf7f3276d50fd21365" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref120_y6x" level="file"><did><unittitle>Thursby, Emma</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1886/1915" type="inclusive">1886-1915</unitdate><container id="aspace_9cd8103a77f9f672579c80cbe6421017" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_9cd8103a77f9f672579c80cbe6421017" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref121_9uw" level="file"><did><unittitle>Thursby, Emma</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_5976e8ec1ee0f5ed4202391a6e033274" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_5976e8ec1ee0f5ed4202391a6e033274" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref122_42t" level="file"><did><unittitle>Thursby, Emma: Account Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1875, 1885, 1886, 1879</unitdate><container id="aspace_8097d7bc37f5cfdc3f60d447e179f3ac" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_8097d7bc37f5cfdc3f60d447e179f3ac" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref123_e4z" level="file"><did><unittitle>Thursby, Alice and Ina</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1885/1891" type="inclusive">1885-1891</unitdate><container id="aspace_baff4bb3a1f7915d9c896d46813c1653" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_baff4bb3a1f7915d9c896d46813c1653" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref124_oat" level="file"><did><unittitle>Thursby, Jane B. and John B.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1843/1877" type="inclusive">1843-1877</unitdate><container id="aspace_f6633de822dff9713c2dd03f9967f4b6" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_f6633de822dff9713c2dd03f9967f4b6" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref125_jb9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Van Cott/Bennett</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1706/1849" type="inclusive">1706-1849</unitdate><container id="aspace_ec6f96c36d311ffcff43ba6a99d042b2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_ec6f96c36d311ffcff43ba6a99d042b2" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref126_neg" level="file"><did><unittitle>Account Books, Checkbook Stubs</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1879/1919" type="inclusive">1879-1919</unitdate><container id="aspace_aeba6e51eb68102020911c4a3dea3bf3" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">14</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref128_uqb" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series III: Legal Papers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1788-1903</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dab67f2ca3583a52432ce613574ef5d4"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Many papers in this series are copies of wills or affidavits of Emma Thursby's family and friends, including Sara Bull, Sarah Farmer, Erminia Rudersorff, and Hannah Thursby (Emma's grandmother).

Many of these books exist for a singular year; it is difficult to determine exactly how she utilized each book (for example, although some of the account books consist solely of lists of accounts; similar lists appear in other books from the same year.) Emma Thursby also owned many address books. Some of these are marked with a certain city, for example, "Boston," in which those named inside live. Others are less segregated. </p><p>A case was made for 57 of the smaller diaries, which date from 1868 to 1929, and embossed with the words "Emma Thursby Diaries." Forty-one other small bound books, including engagement books and address books have been housed in a similar sized box. Seventeen engagement books with paper covers (which run from 1900 to 1916) have been housed in pamphlet folders in a separate box with a large diary from 1898. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref135_whf" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Engagement Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1898/1916" type="inclusive">1898-1916</unitdate><container id="aspace_1b0631600f0443b6cb7fde82736301c8" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref136_uvk" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Address and Engagement Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1886/1922" type="inclusive">1886-1922</unitdate><container id="aspace_b44f4764ca1618060564617a21c1ff9c" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref137_y2s" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Emma Thursby Diaries</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1868/1929" type="inclusive">1868-1929</unitdate><container id="aspace_1a2196524026e3757c7c7917bd404207" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">15</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref139_ajn" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series V: Awards, Ephemera, Notes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1850-1936</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d1313932e821b6bbe98ed77b544c7f77"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This series contains awards presented to Emma Thursby, ephemera and memorabilia belonging to Emma and her family, and handwritten notes.

The material on Sarah Farmer also includes correspondence pertaining to Ms. Farmer's illness in the 1910s, and subsequent attempts to raise money to continue the colony Green Acre in Eliot, Maine. Material devoted specifically to Green Acre, such as programs of lectures and clippings, are housed separately. A blueprint of the Green Acre property is housed in the oversize folder.</p><p>The folder 'Old Brooklyn' contains mainly clippings about and sketches of churches Emma Thursby attended or was engaged by early in her career. A separate folder is dedicated to items pertaining to Henry Ward Beecher, the pastor of Plymouth Church in Brooklyn. This includes information on Beecher, and his church after the time of his pastorship. The folder entitled 'Clippings' contains information about friends of Emma Thursby, and other articles that do not fall under a more specific heading. </p><p>Emma Thursby spent much of the later part of her life engaged with inquiries into philosophy and religion, as evidenced by her support of and attendance at Green Acre programs and lectures, as well as her correspondence and friendship with the Swami Vivekananda. Notes taken by Emma from lectures given by Vivekananda, as well as clippings on pertinent topics and pamphlets detailing Eastern religious philosophies, are included in this series. Some of Emma's notes describe yogic practices of breathing, others are transcriptions of prayers.</p><p>Many amateur poets were inspired by Emma Thursby, judging from the volume of poetry found in the collection. As well as those poems directly dedicated to her, Emma collected clippings of poems from newspapers and magazines, and copied other poems herself. These are all collected here.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref173_8zy" level="file"><did><unittitle>Beecher, Henry Ward/Plymouth Church</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1911/1937" type="inclusive">1911-1937</unitdate><container id="aspace_6003b225d966951e7fabe3fdeb0b0f00" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_6003b225d966951e7fabe3fdeb0b0f00" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref174_8oi" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bull, Ole</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1901/1909" type="inclusive">1901-1909</unitdate><container id="aspace_0cb15e1f84665b527b0fe5f304720593" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_0cb15e1f84665b527b0fe5f304720593" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref175_z9o" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings re various subjects</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1892/1931" type="inclusive">1892-1931</unitdate><container id="aspace_10fc3cf06b6be21a2f2b1166f3adffdb" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_10fc3cf06b6be21a2f2b1166f3adffdb" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref176_k7x" level="file"><did><unittitle>East Indian Philosophies</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1883/1937" type="inclusive">1883-1937</unitdate><container id="aspace_9093fd967c6d7b036c5d8f30a6f5da10" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_9093fd967c6d7b036c5d8f30a6f5da10" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref177_kvb" level="file"><did><unittitle>East Indian Philosophies</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1883/1937" type="inclusive">1883-1937</unitdate><container id="aspace_b5cbdfb12b25845ba5b0ae3064c73656" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_b5cbdfb12b25845ba5b0ae3064c73656" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref178_d0w" level="file"><did><unittitle>Farmer, Sarah</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1901/1913" type="inclusive">1901-1914</unitdate><container id="aspace_30d4fae0fd9b751de6bb605349e017ce" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_30d4fae0fd9b751de6bb605349e017ce" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref179_2rx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Green Acre</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1891/1911" type="inclusive">1891-1911</unitdate><container id="aspace_cce29ac72aac8b8e64e40cf15268aafb" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_cce29ac72aac8b8e64e40cf15268aafb" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref180_w2o" level="file"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">Herald of Life</title></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1892/1894" type="inclusive">1892-1894</unitdate><container id="aspace_add73d7d233dbe7c7a9f649b185b41dc" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_add73d7d233dbe7c7a9f649b185b41dc" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref181_him" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Old Brooklyn"-re: churches of Brooklyn</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1908/1937" type="inclusive">1908-1937</unitdate><container id="aspace_1601c6b7fb47309654c1dadd6c89a488" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_1601c6b7fb47309654c1dadd6c89a488" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref182_iv7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Poetry</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1879/1925" type="inclusive">1879-1925</unitdate><container id="aspace_bf7894593248afbc6180eccda8025b6e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_bf7894593248afbc6180eccda8025b6e" type="Folder">10</container></did></c></c></c><c id="aspace_ref185_kw5" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series VII: Autographs</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1875-1910</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fb224e0ddac6bce962ff36e3cd1db084"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Contains loose autographs and a bound autograph book, which was a gift to Emma Thursby from her father.
