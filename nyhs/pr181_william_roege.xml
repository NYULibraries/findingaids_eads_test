<p>Approximately 500 vintage negatives and corresponding photographic prints by William J. Roege were purchased on March 19, 1940. The vintage prints were dispersed throughout the Geographic File (PR 020); the negatives remain in this collection. Modern contact prints in this collection were produced between 1968 through 1970 by Klein Brothers Studio, New York, under contract with the New-York Historical Society to reformat its oversize glass negatives. The majority of the oversize negatives from which photographic prints were made were destroyed.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Photographer William J. Roege (1883-1970) worked for commercial photography firms and independently in New York City from at least 1914 through the 1950s, turning his camera toward the businesses and residences of Manhattan and Brooklyn. From at least 1914 through 1923, Roege worked for the firm American Studio at 87 Nassau Street, while making his home in Newark and then Belleville, New Jersey. Photographs within this collection indicate that he was working as a photographer as early as 1910. By 1925, Roege was working at Boyette, the eponymous commercial photography firm owned by Fine Boyette located at 105 West 47th Street, and had moved his residence temporarily to Manhattan. By the 1950s, Roege had moved back to New Jersey, and in 1957 he began using his Belleville address as his sole business address. The business continued to be listed in his name in city directories through the 1970s, although Social Security records indicate that Roege died in December of 1970. Little is known of Roege's life beyond his professional work.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The William J. Roege Photograph Collection spans the period from 1910 through 1935, during the early part of Roege's long career, when he was based in New York. Photographic prints and negatives depict New York City buildings, parks, residences, and street life. The collection is especially rich in views of hotels and restaurants which have largely vanished. Other views include Times Square in the 1910s, Columbus Circle in 1918, and upper Fifth Avenue residences in the 1920s. There are also several rooftop and high-angle views of Manhattan and the Hudson and East Rivers, views of Brooklyn, the New Jersey waterfront, and other nearby locations. It is likely that some of the photographs in this collection were produced in the course of Roege's employment at American Studio and Boyette, both of New York, as several photographs bear Boyette's name in script, together with Roege's signature.</p><p>The collection is organized into two series: Photographic Prints; and Negatives. Roege signed most of his images, and sometimes he supplied the date and location. His signature often conforms to the structure depicted; for example, he has signed along the running board of a 1930s automobile, and on the edge of a street curb. Undated photographs can safely be ascribed to the period before 1940, the year the Society acquired this collection. It should be noted that a few of the photographs and negatives are copies of Roege's earlier works, or lithographs, and of other photographers' New York views.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Nearly 500 vintage prints by Roege, many of which correspond to negatives in this collection, remain dispersed throughout the Geographic File (PR 020). Oversize negatives and modern prints from the William J. Roege Photograph Collection were originally housed with the George P. Hall &amp; Son Photograph Collection; it is possible that a few items by Roege remain in the Hall Collection if they carry no indication of their creator.</p>  </relatedmaterial>

The approximately 175 photographic prints in this series are modern 11 x 14 inch silver gelatin contact prints produced by Klein Brothers Studios, New York, between 1968 and 1970 from Roege's vintage negatives. They were made as part of the New-York Historical Society's effort to reformat their brittle oversize negatives; most of the negatives from which these prints were made have been destroyed.</p><p>The photographs in this series are arranged into the following subseries, alphabetically by subject: Bridge and River Views; Churches; Commercial and Public Buildings; Hotels; Restaurants; Street Scenes; Theaters; and Miscellaneous. Within each series, photographs are arranged alphabetically. Corresponding negative numbers have been written in parentheses after each subject to aid researchers and indicate the number of views available. Many of Roege's views are populated by active people and early automobiles, and provide an energetic glimpse of city life from the 1910s through 1930s.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref14_req"

Negatives</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_926eb7b10dd6b9aabd98c1cc02dbbab9"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Series II spans the period from ca. 1912 to 1937 and includes both film and glass negatives varying in size from 4 x 5 to 11 x 14 inches. Negatives are arranged according to format and size, and thereunder by negative numbers assigned by The New-York Historical Society. Upon accession, staff assigned numbers between 9001 and 9499 to Roege's negatives which were arranged first by size and thereunder very loosely by geographic location. This order may reflect Roege's own filing system.</p><p>Oversize negatives in this collection were once part of the George P. Hall &amp; Son Photograph Collection, and were assigned new negative numbers beginning with 666 and with a -D suffix (which was used to indicate oversize negatives) for inclusion in the Negative Collection card catalog. These numbers are still listed on the negative enclosures and are given in parentheses after image descriptions within this finding aid. Where there are gaps in the negative numbering, the negatives were not present at the time of processing and are presumed to have been destroyed.</p><p>Hotels, street scenes, rooftop views, and churches in Manhattan are well represented, and are joined by a large group of photographs of Columbia University and other institutions, primarily in Manhattan. A few images of business districts in the Bronx, the New Jersey waterfront, and other locations near Manhattan are included. Although many of Roege's views consist of systematic documentation of businesses, probably done on commission, he also turned his camera to less commonly photographed sites including saloons on Chatham Square in the Bowery, and German ocean liners interned in New Jersey during World War I. Images also include those of Temple Emanu-El and Rockefeller Center soon after they were constructed.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref262_yh6" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Film Negatives - 4 x
