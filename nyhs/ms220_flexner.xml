<p>The James Thomas Flexner Papers are sorted in twenty series. Series I through XVIII contain the research notes pertaining to one or more of Flexner's published books. Series XIX and XX contain drafts of unpublished novels, miscellaneous correspondence, and subject files. Since much of the material within each series is undated, the collection is sorted chronologically by publication date. File titles are derived from those in a 2003 inventory of the collection; these were transcribed, apparently, from Flexner's original container labels.</p>    <list type="deflist">

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>James Thomas Flexner was born in Manhattan on January 13, 1908 to Simon and Helen (Thomas) Flexner. Simon Flexner (1863–1946), a physician, scientist, and professor of experimental pathology at the University of Pennsylvania, served as first director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. Helen (Thomas) Flexner (1871–1956), a professor of English at Bryn Mawr College (where her sister served as president), was connected by family marriages to the philosopher Bertrand Russell and the art critic Bernard Berenson.<lb/>
<lb/>
As a child James Thomas Flexner found reading and writing difficult. He overcame his dyslexia one day as he sat in Central Park staring at a page of Beatrix Potter's <emph render="italic">The Tale of Peter Rabbit</emph>, when the printed marks suddenly formed themselves into words. This achievement so inspired Flexner that from then on writing his own stories became the focus of his life. Educated at the progressive Lincoln School of Columbia University's Teachers College, he went on to graduate <emph render="italic">magna cum laude</emph> with a degree in English from Harvard University in 1929. Soon after he was hired to write human interest pieces for the <emph render="italic">New York Herald Tribune</emph>, but left by 1931 for a position with the New York City Department of Health. He resigned the following year to devote his full time to writing. <lb/>
<lb/>
His first book, <emph render="italic">Doctors on Horseback: Pioneers of American Medicine</emph> (1937), was inspired by the work of his father. (Simon Flexner is probably best known for developing a serum treatment for spinal meningitis.) From medicine he gravitated to art history, with <emph render="italic">America's Old Masters: First Artists of the New World</emph> (1939), a study of the painters Benjamin West, John Singleton Copley, Charles Willson Peale, and Gilbert Stuart. This work, and Flexner's three-volume <emph render="italic">History of American Painting</emph> (1947–1962), helped establish the subject as an academic specialty, despite the author's lack of formal training in the field. <lb/>
<lb/>
American history and biography, too, supplied compelling material for Flexner's talents. 1953 saw publication of <emph render="italic">The Traitor and the Spy: Benedict Arnold and John André</emph>. This was followed in 1959 by <emph render="italic">Mohawk Baronet: Sir William Johnson of New York</emph>. But George Washington would prove Flexner's most enduring and rewarding subject. <lb/>
<lb/>
The four-volume <emph render="italic">George Washington: A Biography</emph>, appeared between 1965 and 1972. Critics hailed Flexner's portrait for demystifying Washington, for moving beyond "the marble image" and bringing the hero "down from Olympus." The final volume, <emph render="italic">Anguish and Farewell, 1793–1799</emph>, won the 1973 National Book Award for Biography and a special Pulitzer citation. In 1974 Flexner published a single volume abridgment of the series, <emph render="italic">Washington: The Indispensable Man</emph>. Flexner's Washington works were adapted as television miniseries in the mid-1980s starring Barry Bostwick as the first president. <lb/>
<lb/>
Flexner's later biographies, <emph render="italic">The Young Hamilton</emph> (1978) and <emph render="italic">States Dyckman: American Loyalist</emph> (1980) were followed by volumes of a personal nature: <emph render="italic">An American Saga: The Story of Helen Thomas and Simon Flexner</emph> (1984) and <emph render="italic">Maverick's Progress</emph> (1996), an autobiography. <lb/>
<lb/>
James Flexner married professional singer Beatrice Hudson (1919–1998) in 1950. The couple had one daughter, Helen. Flexner died, age 95, in Manhattan, on February 13, 2003. <lb/>

<p>James Thomas Flexner gave the bulk of the collection to the New-York Historical Society on October 11, 1974. (In the acknowledgements to his 1996 autobiography, <emph render="italic">Maverick's Progress</emph>, Flexner thanks the Society for its more than sixty years of hospitality. During that time he was accorded research and writing space in the library.) Donations of material continued through the 1990s and possibly as late as 2003, the year of Flexner's death.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>A member of the New-York Historical Society's library staff inventoried the James Thomas Flexner Papers in 2003 (the year of Flexner's death). In 2019, to prepare the collection for shipment to offsite storage, stacks project archivist Elise Winks rehoused it in record cartons and revised the 2003 inventory to include newly-assigned box numbers. Processing archivist Joseph Ditta based the present finding aid (2019) on Winks' updated inventory. The materials in the collection have not been sorted or thoroughly examined, hence the scattered filing of related items and the vagueness of dates.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Related Materials</head>
<p>In addition to copies of most of Flexner's published books, the New-York Historical Society also holds typescripts for his "The Traitor and the Spy: Benedict Arnold and John André " (1953) and "Mohawk Baronet: Sir William Johnson of New York" (1959).</p>  </relatedmaterial>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The James Thomas Flexner Papers include the raw materials—drafts, galleys, scrapbooks, typescripts, index cards, research notes, subject files, and correspondence—that the author used to create most of his twenty-six books on art history and American history and biography. Not every format exists for each book project. Because the collection has not been processed below the box level (it was inventoried in 2003 and rehoused but not reordered in 2019), it is difficult to know the extent of topic coverage or the date range of items. The container list below attempts to minimize the haphazard placement of related material by grouping it under its common project title. Interested researchers should consult each box listed under a particular series, except for Series XX, which contains miscellaneous correspondence and subject files that are scattered throughout most of the collection's 58 boxes.</p>  </scopecontent>
