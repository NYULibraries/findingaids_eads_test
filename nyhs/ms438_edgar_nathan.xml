    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Edgar J. Nathan, Jr. was born in New York City to parents Edgar J. Nathan, Sr. and Sara N. Solis on 28 August 1891. As a young man, Edgar J. Nathan, Jr. attended the Collegiate School, graduating in 1909 and receiving his A.B. degree from Williams College in 1913. Following in his father's footsteps, Nathan then studied law at Columbia University, where he received his L.L.B. After graduating from Columbia in 1916, Nathan briefly practiced law in his father's firm, Cardozo &amp; Nathan (though relatives of Benjamin N. Cardozo worked for this firm, there are no records in this collection of Benjamin N. Cardozo in conjunction with Cardozo &amp; Nathan), before marrying his lifelong wife, Mabel Unterberg, in 1917, with whom he would have two sons: Edgar J. Nathan, III and Frederick S. Nathan. When World War I began, he got a job at the War Trade Board, where he remained for two years. He climbed the ranks of his department, becoming the Chief of the Division of Restricted Imports before he resigned to return to the practice of law at Cardozo &amp; Nathan. </p><p>Nathan, a direct descendant of Abraham de Lucena, one of the 13 original Jewish settlers in America, came from a very prestigious bloodline with deep ties to the United States, New York City, Judaism, and Shearith Israel—the earliest Jewish congregation in America, which was founded by Nathan's ancestors upon their arrival in New Amsterdam in 1654. As a result, Nathan dedicated large portions of his life to Jewish service and held positions of power in various Jewish organizations, including such titles as Vice-President, and later President, of Shearith Israel (for much of his life), Director of the Jewish Theological Seminary, Director and Vice-President of the American Jewish Historical Society, Secretary of the Jewish Family Service, President of the League of Fraternal and Benevolent Organizations of the Jewish Education Committee, and Director and President of The Judeans, among others. Nathan also did philanthropic work outside of the Jewish community, working as Director of the Goodwill Industries of New York and Honorary Director of the Knickerbocker Hospital in addition to donating large sums of money to various organizations, including his alma maters, all three of which (in addition to the Jewish Theological Seminary) eventually granted him awards or honorary degrees.</p><p>Though Nathan attempted to secure a position as Assistant Attorney General in 1920, it was not until 1937 that he was elected to his first political office, as a Republican delegate to the New York Constitutional Convention. There, he was on the Committees on the Judiciary, Bill of Rights, and Cities, where he worked with such notable politicians as Al Smith and Robert Wagner. One year later, in 1939, he ran for a vacant position on the New York Supreme Court, but failed to obtain the office, and so returned to the practice of law.</p><p>In 1941, Nathan successfully ran for Manhattan Borough President on the Republican and Fusion Party tickets. While in office, from 1941-1945, he worked alongside Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and Robert Moses on post-war construction works, including the East River (FDR) Drive and plans for the proposed Lower Manhattan Expressway (LOMEX), though it was never built. When he ran for reelection in 1946 and was ousted, he briefly joined the law firm of Gale, Bernays, Falk, Eisner, &amp; Nathan, before Governor Thomas Dewey appointed him to a vacant seat on the New York Supreme Court, in the First Judicial District, in March 1946. That November, Nathan was officially elected to fill the vacancy for a fourteen-year term, and eventually, in 1960, he ran successfully for reelection. He served on the court past the retirement age, remaining on the bench until his death on 30 April 1965.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Edgar J. Nathan, Jr. papers are comprised primarily of documents related to Edgar J. Nathan's work in civic service, both in terms of his involvement in New York politics and his active Jewish life. The collection includes papers—including correspondence, speeches, campaign materials, and reports on his accomplishments in office—for the three main stages of Nathan's political life, beginning with his time as a delegate to the 1938 New York Constitutional Convention and proceeding to his tenure as Manhattan Borough President in the early 1940s and New York Supreme Court Justice from 1946 until his death in 1965. During the years of Nathan's political service, he came into contact and formed relationships with a variety of influential political figures, including Dwight D. Eisenhower, Fiorello La Guardia, Robert Moses, Al Smith, Robert Wagner, Nelson Rockefeller, and Thomas Dewey. Thus, the collection includes correspondence with some of these men, though in other cases Nathan possessed only their signatures or impersonal notes from their offices. The collection also includes a significant amount of correspondence with Nathan's cousin, Supreme Court Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo.</p><p>In regards to Nathan's Jewish life, the collection contains documents—mainly souvenir programs, correspondence, speeches, and print matter—from a variety of organizations with which he was intimately involved, most prominently Shearith Israel (also known as the Spanish and Portuguese Congregation) and the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS). The papers include extensive correspondence and memorabilia from major events in each organization's history, including Shearith Israel's (and worldwide) tercentenary celebrations commemorating the 300th anniversary of the arrival of Jews in America, the Jewish Theological Seminary's semi-centennial anniversary, and, in the case of Shearith Israel, stretching as far back as the consecration of their current house of worship in 1896.   </p><p>The collection is also home to a sizable quantity of Nathan's personal correspondence and bills, most of which originate from the mid-20th century, as well as photographs, accumulated books (mostly on Jewish topics), and personal memorabilia, some of which pertains to preceding generations of the Nathan family—including, but not limited to, information on early Jewish immigration to the United States that traces the genealogies of the Nathan, Gomez, Seixas and Solis families. </p><p>For more information on early Jewish families that were related to the Nathans, see the New-York Historical Society's collection of the Hendricks Family papers.</p>  </scopecontent>

Nathan, Jr.'s position as delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1938. Much of the series constitutes documents regarding the 1937 election, including voting schedules and results, colorful district maps, candidate promotional materials and other ephemera, and correspondence in light of Nathan's victory. However, the series also includes correspondence about the convention itself, such as a letter from Nathan to his wife, Mabel, on the daily routine at the convention, fairly extensive records on amendments proposed in Albany, and a souvenir poster signed by the members of the Committee on the Judiciary (especially significant are the signatures of Al Smith and Robert Wagner). Post-convention correspondence, which is also included in the series, is primarily in regards to dinner reunion plans and two funerals for former delegates to the convention. Additionally, the series contains 11 of the original 12 volumes of reading material sent out to the delegates in preparation for their duties, which mainly concern foundational information on U.S. government and constitutional history.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_70874803c683c4e8c7d6158458bf1a00" level="file"><did><unittitle>Campaign Materials (2 folders of 3)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1937</unitdate><container id="aspace_9b68425f6ec6a2947e77251d5a618fca" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_9b68425f6ec6a2947e77251d5a618fca" type="Folder">1-2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_af9e24d0a1ce73028814936f8c5f5c49" level="file"><did><unittitle>Campaign Materials (Folder 3 of 3)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1937</unitdate><container id="aspace_e64c838052266c73ce553859e2dbf0c8" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">Oversize Small</container><container parent="aspace_e64c838052266c73ce553859e2dbf0c8" type="Folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f09f26741716f2a61fb0bfc1d947d2b9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Oversize 1937 Borough of Manhattan election schedule, Republican ballot instructional manual and oversize maps of 7th and 11th Manhattan Assembly Districts.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6e3fddc2bf011d4c164832d54a5db690" level="file"><did><unittitle>Congratulations on Election</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1937</unitdate><container id="aspace_f945f8a7df14ace9a32f5cad393e1999" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_f945f8a7df14ace9a32f5cad393e1999" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_57a0fff8758008f125012f1028053192" level="file"><did><unittitle>Misc.

Much of the material is about World War II and post-war construction works, including the construction of the East River Drive (FDR) and the proposed Lower Manhattan Expressway (LOMEX), which was never built.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_2e11ea9daa4b874be4f781a22e2c0372" level="file"><did><unittitle>Congratulations on Nomination</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1941</unitdate><container id="aspace_920a7f9747cc4b8426600e0eb73b4db2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_920a7f9747cc4b8426600e0eb73b4db2" type="Folder">11</container></did></c><c id="aspace_e26aa6fdbb7bb4a9210329bce64fd172" level="file"><did><unittitle>Campaign Materials (Folder 1 of 2)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1941</unitdate><container id="aspace_15c02a96584b886d01393e3f37fe43c5" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_15c02a96584b886d01393e3f37fe43c5" type="Folder">12</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e6f12b152ebdfdd342b63b257076dd97"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Election materials from 1941 campaign for Manhattan Borough Presidency, including biographies, press releases, and a Speaker's Handbook re: La Guardia Administration accomplishments, among other documents.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c377e8c94157c7ca8b0da741115febc4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Campaign Materials (Folder 2 of 2)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_90277018fe57f575205f7adf07d29c65" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_90277018fe57f575205f7adf07d29c65" type="Folder">13</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d3f4b5ab9a97202adbb762e756273519"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Campaign materials from failed 1945 campaign for re-election to office of Manhattan Borough President, including campaign song, list of construction works, endorsements, and remarks.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_a60dc9808b3624a64bd1ab3f14b99d90" level="file"><did><unittitle>Misc.
