    <abstract id="aspace_3708e3837b056c48aebdbd037cc1c467">Agreement by John Carpender, a New York City butcher, with a committee of the Common Council to farm (i.e., lease) the public market for one year at a rent of 98 pounds. The agreement opens with the Common Council's resolution of 14 October 1743 to advertise for the public auction of the lease at the house of James Coden on 26 October 1753, and to designate a committee to attend the auction and to set the conditions for letting the market. The agreement then includes the conditions established by the committee, including rent payment, a performance bond, authorization for persons to cut up and sell meat in the market, contingency if the farmer or lessee does not supply the bond or rent, that the lessee is entitled to the revenues and profits, and that the city will make necessary repairs to the market houses. In addition to Carpender, the agreement is signed by the Council's committee members attending the auction: Gerardus Stuyvesant, Simon Johnson, Stephen Van Cortlandt, Henry Bogert, Joris Brinckerhoff, and Robert Benson.
