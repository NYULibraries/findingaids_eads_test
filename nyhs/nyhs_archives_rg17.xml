Much of the record group includes the files of N-YHS's Editorial Department, which existed from about 1942 to 1980, and relates to the editorial work for articles proposed and written for the organization's journal, the <emph render="italic">Quarterly</emph>. The files also include editorial records for some of the books published by N-YHS, especially George C. Groce and David H. Wallace's <emph render="italic">Dictionary of Artists in America</emph> (1957), for which there is extensive correspondence and research notes. The record group also includes the papers presented at a series of six conferences on historical themes sponsored by N-YHS and organized by historian William Pencak from 1983 to 1988, along with the editorial files for the four volumes co-edited by Pencak based on the conference proceedings.  Other principal correspondents include editors Charles E. Baker and Kathleen Luhrs, designer Klaus Gemming, members of N-YHS's Publications Committee, and authors William Sawitzky, Susan Clay Sawitzky, Mary Bartlett Cowdrey, Paul H.

    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>From its earliest years, the New-York Historical Society was actively engaged in publishing materials ranging from pamphlets of individual addresses on historical topics to collections of edited historical documents to monographic studies. In his 1954 history of N-YHS, R.W.G. Vail counted about 600 such publications and provided an overview of them. Among the several publishing initiatives was the <emph render="italic">New-York Historical Society Quarterly Bulletin.</emph> Begun in 1917, the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> published feature articles, notes on N-YHS's activities, transcripts of historical documents in the collection, and other matter. Yet despite the extensive range of publishing activities, until the mid-twentieth century there was no staff dedicated to editorial activities. Until 1938, the Librarian and Assistant Librarian performed editorial tasks along with their other responsibilities. </p><p>This began to change in 1938 with the designation of Assistant Librarian Dorothy C. Barck as Editor and Head of Research. Still, though, Barck worked within N-YHS's library and held responsibilities well beyond editing the institution's publications; indeed, she was named Librarian in 1942. But N-YHS's drive in the late 1930s and early 1940s to expand its programs and professional operations led in 1943 to the hiring of Charles E. Baker as N-YHS's first full-time editor and the establishment of an Editorial Department reporting to the Director. Baker remained Editor until 1963. </p><p>There were at least two notable accomplishments during Baker's tenure that are well-represented in this record group's documents: the expansion and increased scholarly content of the <emph render="italic">Quarterly Bulletin</emph> (called the <emph render="italic">Quarterly</emph> from 1946) and the production of George C. Groce and David H. Wallace's  <emph render="italic">Dictionary of Artists in America (DAA).</emph> The  <emph render="italic">DAA</emph> was an initiative begun in the early 1940s to expand on art historian George Groce's 1940 survey of early American artists. Groce, living in Washington, DC, worked with Baker on the  <emph render="italic">DAA </emph>for well over a decade before it was published in 1957. Along the way, N-YHS hired David H. Wallace as an assistant editor in 1952, with principal responsibility for seeing the  <emph render="italic">DAA</emph> to a conclusion. Wallace completed the task just before leaving N-YHS in 1956, earning co-authorship credit with Groce for the achievement. </p><p>During his twenty years as Editor at N-YHS, Baker oversaw the production of several books in addition to the <emph render="italic">DAA</emph> and worked with many authors, including William Sawitzky and his wife Susan Clay Sawitzky, Rita Gottesman, Theodore Bolton, Paul H. Downing, Lawrence H. Leder, and others. After Baker's departure from N-YHS, the editorship was filled by a series of short-term appointments, including by Ann E. Cooper and Jane (Mrs. Wendell) Garrett, until 1967 when Kathleen A. Luhrs became Editor, a position she held until 1976. The mid-1960s were another important period for the <emph render="italic">Quarterly</emph> as a redesign of the journal by Klaus Gemming was well-received. </p><p>Elaine Andrews took over as Editor in 1977, but she was the last to hold that position at N-YHS. Financial difficulties resulted in the decision to no longer publish the <emph render="italic">Quarterly</emph> after its first number of 1980 and the Editorial Department was disbanded. Through the end of the twentieth century, N-YHS still continued to produce publications, but no longer on a regular basis with a full-time dedicated staff. An important example of these later publications, represented in this record group, are the four volumes published from 1988-1991 of papers based on conferences held at N-YHS from 1983 to 1988. The six conferences were organized for N-YHS by William Pencak, a professor of history at Pennsylvania State University. Organized around particular themes, the conference titles were: New Approaches to the History of Colonial and Revolutionary New York (1983); New York and the Rise of American Capitalism (1984); Law in America (1985); Immigration to New York (1986); New York in the Age of the Constitution (1987); and Labor in New York (1988). Although the original intent was to publish all or most of the papers presented at the conferences, financial constraints resulted in only the first four conferences appearing in print. Pencak co-edited the volumes with the logistical arrangements handled by Marilyn McShane, a freelancer hired in November 1987 by N-YHS to guide the delayed volumes to completion. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The New-York Historical Society publication editorial records include the files of the Editorial Department from its early days in the 1940s under Charles E. Baker to the close of the Department in 1980. There are also files from the 1980s, primarily in connection with the series of six conferences sponsored by N-YHS from 1983 to 1988 and the resulting volumes published from 1988 to 1991. The record group includes correspondence with authors in relation to the editing process; internal N-YHS notes assessing manuscripts for publication; manuscript submissions and edited versions of the manuscripts; and documents related to arrangements for printing and publicity. The files related to the conferences of the 1980s include all the papers originally presented at those sessions. Much of the record group concerns articles proposed and written for the <emph render="italic">Quarterly.</emph> Published books are also the subject of the record group, especially the production of the <emph render="italic">Dictionary of Artists in America.</emph> Efforts by William Sawitzky and, after his death, his wife Susan Clay Sawitzky to write a series of books on American artists in the 1940s-1950s are well-documented. The files also include various administrative matters such as arranging for photograph reproduction permissions, printing, publicity, book reviews, and the like.</p>  </scopecontent>

George C. Groce and David H. Wallace's <emph render="italic">Dictionary of Artists in America</emph>, published in 1957, is the best documented publication in the series. There is extensive correspondence between N-YHS editors Charles E. Baker and David Wallace and Groce, as well as with Yale University Press concerning production and royalty payments. The original cards used to record research notes and sources for the <emph render="italic">DAA</emph> entries are in the series. And the series also holds much correspondence and notes concerning information about artists provided after the <emph render="italic">DAA</emph>'s publication in anticipation that a supplement to the <emph render="italic">DAA</emph> might be prepared. The series also includes a 2015 donation of documents from David Wallace that includes extracts from his diaries and other documents dating from his years working at N-YHS and with Groce on the <emph render="italic">DAA</emph>.</p><p>In addition to the <emph render="italic">DAA</emph>, the series includes correspondence related to articles for the <emph render="italic">Quarterly</emph> and various book-length works. Unfinished and unpublished projects are represented in the series as well as published works. Although much of the general correspondence files concern administrative matters, such as acquiring image reproduction permissions, many files touch on more substantive matters, such as the editorial and management decisions regarding whether or not to publish a piece and the sometimes fraught relationship between editor and author. William Sawitzky, Susan Clay Sawitzky, Paul Downing, Mary Bartlett Cowdrey, and Theodore Bolton are among the several correspondents represented in the general correspondence of the series.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_377660d626fed4e9d56d86dd29a0209c"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The series is organized in three subseries:</p><p>I.A.

Baker, from 1943 to 1963. Some of Baker's files appear to have been maintained for a time after his departure so the date range of the correspondence extends into the mid-1960s and, in the case of a file of copyright registrations, to the early 1980s. The correspondence concerns the editorial process for articles and book reviews for the <emph render="italic">Quarterly</emph>, as well as various book-length works. The material relates to works that were either published, unfinished and unpublished, or proposed but declined from the 1940s through the mid-1960s. </p><p>Many of the files primarily include only administrative matters related to the editorial process, such as transmittal letters, photograph reproduction requests and permissions, arrangements for printing, requests for book reviewers, mailings of copies of the published work, and other such matters. Nevertheless, more substantive content can be found in several files; these include Baker's recommendations to the N-YHS Publications Committee regarding a proposed publication and the Committee's response and editorial comments to the author. Only a few files have manuscript drafts of the work and these are noted in the container list. A few files hold photographs and negatives; these are also noted in the container list.</p><p>Among the more substantive topical files are those concerning Susan Clay Sawitzky's efforts through the late 1940s and into the early 1960s to continue the late William Sawitzky's publications on American artists; the unsuccessful Rockefeller Foundation-funded attempt to publish a book by Paul Downing on historic carriages; differences of historical interpretation with Eugene F. Kramer in connection with his proposed <emph render="italic">Quarterly</emph> article on the Harry Croswell case of 1802; and publication of Harold Edward Dickson's <emph render="italic">John Wesley Jarvis, American Painter</emph>. Among the many other correspondents with substantive content are Theodore Bolton, Irwin Cortelyou, Rita and Callman Gottesman, Fenwick Beekman, Mary Bartlett Cowdrey, Stuyvesant Fish, Lawrence H. Leder, Arthur Merritt, J.E. Strickland, Leonidas Westervelt, and George Zabriskie.</p><p>This subseries does not include the principal editorial records for the <emph render="italic">Dictionary of Artists in America</emph> (see subseries I.B for those).

Most of the material dates from after William's death in 1947 and concerns Susan Sawitzky's efforts to continue William's work toward publications concerning Ralph Earl, Reuben Moulthrop, Lawrence Kilbourn, Abraham Delanoy, Jr., and others. In addition to letters, the folders include photographs, negatives, reproduction permissions, manuscript drafts, and other matter. (See also the William Sawitzky papers in N-YHS's manuscript collection; that collection includes typescripts of Sawitzky's 1940s lectures at N-YHS, which refer to some extent to artworks and exhibitions at N-YHS.)</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref113_pu5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sawitzky, William and Susan Clay.

The files of Groce's correspondence also include the originals, copies, or typescripts of letters sent to Groce or N-YHS by other correspondents and <emph render="italic">DAA</emph> contributors in connection with Groce's inquiries. </p><p>The correspondence also includes files from a wide range of curators, editors, scholars, descendants of artists, and others providing information about artists for the <emph render="italic">DAA.</emph> Some correspondents also discuss their own interests or advance inquiries of tangential relevance to the <emph render="italic">DAA.</emph>  Principal correspondents include J. Earl Arrington, Rudolf Berliner, Wolfgang Born, Ralph Catterall, David C. Duniway, Edward H. Dwight, Elliot A.P. Evans, Sinclair Hamilton, John Davis Hatch, Jr., Bertha L. Heilbron, H. Maxson Holloway, Cliff Lord, Wilbur D. Peat, Francis W. Robinson, Anna Rutledge, Robert Taft, and Edna T. Whitley.</p><p>Finally, the correspondence includes exchanges between N-YHS and the publisher, Yale University Press, concerning arrangements for the production of the book and payment of royalties to N-YHS. These files include the original agreement with Yale concerning royalties and the records of royalties forwarded to N-YHS from 1959-1982.</p><p>The subseries includes 19 boxes of note cards. All but one of these boxes appear to hold the original notes about artists developed by Groce and shipped to N-YHS. Several of the boxes are original and some have the shipping label on them. Paperclipped to many of the original note cards are added slips of paper with revisions, updated entry information, some correspondence, and other documents. Sixteen of the boxes relate to entries in the <emph render="italic">DAA</emph> and two boxes relate to artists that were "rejected" from inclusion. One box holds cards dating from shortly after the <emph render="italic">DAA's</emph> production and these record new information received in anticipation of a possible supplement to the <emph render="italic">DAA.</emph></p><p>The sub-series also includes a small number of topical files related to publicity and requests for copies of the <emph render="italic">DAA</emph> and a copy of the <emph render="italic">DAA</emph> inscribed by Groce to Baker.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref668_n6h" level="file"><did><unittitle>Groce, George C.

The papers include a few letters, including those of 1952 from Director R.W.G.

Most of these are straightforward exchanges leading to the final, polished product, but others reflect a more intense editing process and some editor/author friction. </p><p>Most of the folders include the galley proofs with author edits noted. Many folders include the initial or edited manuscript submission, with annotations, and those folders that include the manuscript are noted in the container list. Many of the folders also include the informal notes with commentary exchanged between the Editorial Department, Director James Heslin, and the Publication Committee regarding whether to publish the article, its importance, suitability for the <emph render="italic">Quarterly</emph>, quality of the author's argument and writing, and need for edits. A small number of folders include reader reactions to the article.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref163_ug1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aldridge, A. Owen.

This correspondence primarily concerns the production aspects of the <emph render="italic">Quarterly</emph>, including design, printing, and publicity. Accordingly, the principal correspondents are vendors providing production services to N-YHS, including designer Klaus Gemming, Finn Typographers, and Meriden Gravure Company. There is some correspondence concerning <emph render="italic">Quarterly</emph> content, including solicitations for book reviewers and commentary from the Publications Committee. And there is some correspondence related to matters other than the <emph render="italic">Quarterly</emph>, such as with University Press of Virginia concerning distribution of N-YHS's publications.
