    <abstract id="aspace_8de8f3830970d148e03cd65068adde4e" label="Abstract">The Kitson Papers consist of materials of various forms related primarily to the work of Henry Hudson Kitson, a sculptor of public monuments. The collection also contains papers of Kitson's first wife, Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson, who was also a sculptor. The bulk of the correspondence consists of letters to Henry Kitson from individuals and organizations who commissioned work from him. Legal documents, especially signed and unsigned contracts, are in the collection. Photographs, mostly unidentified but also including studies for known sculpture subjects, comprise a sizable portion of the collection. The collection contains rough sketches of works and details of works, also mostly unidentified as to subject. Some blueprints are included. Financial records in the collection consist most notably of invoices and receipts from contractors providing materials and services for the Kitsons' projects.</abstract>

<p>Henry Hudson Kitson (c. 1863 -- 1947) studied and excelled at stone-carving as a youth in Huddersfield, England. At the age of 13, he emigrated to New York City where he worked as a stone-carver in the shop of his older brother, Samuel James Kitson (1848 -- 1906). During the 1880s, Kitson moved to Paris to study his craft, exhibited his work in Europe and in the United States, was honored with awards, and received various prestigious commissions, including one for a bust of Queen Elizabeth of Rumania. </p><p>Kitson taught carving to a number of students, among them Theo Alice Ruggles (1871 -- 1932), from Brookline, Massachusetts, who would become his wife in 1893. Ruggles's early career as a sculptor also included further studies, sculpture exhibitions, and awards in Europe. </p><p>From the 1890s until their deaths, the Kitsons lived primarily in and around Boston, though they also spent time in New York City. Much of their work is found in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states, but also as far west as Iowa and as far south as Mississippi. They each developed their own reputations as sculptors and pursued their craft as individuals, but they also collaborated on works as well. They have been characterized as "among the most prolific of turn-of-the-century sculptors of public commissions, particularly monuments to public figures and to Civil War heroes." The works cited in the above chronology reflect this and are representative of Henry Kitson's projects: The Parker, Pilgrim Maiden, Conant, and Saltonstall works depict real or figurative individuals from New England's colonial and Revolutionary past; the H Company, Iowa and Lee memorials concern Civil War combatants; and Henry B. Endicott was a state and federal official in Boston during the World War I years. Wendell Endicott, the son of Henry B. Endicott, recommended Kitson for further public commission in Boston in his letter of July 15, 1921: "[E]verything that he has done brings out one particular point and that is, strength, manhood and life. All his work seems to be virile. Another point was the very plain way he approached the subject, and his evident desire to accomplish results that would be satisfactory all around. There was no pose with the man; he talked simply of his work, but talked in thorough confidence of what he could do." </p><p>Henry and Theo Kitson had two daughters and one son. After Theo's death, Henry married Maria Louisa Hobron, who died one month before he did. </p>  </bioghist>

Correspondents with five or more letters in the collection have a folder of their own. The correspondence received by Theo Kitson is foldered separately from the letters received by Henry Kitson. </p><p>For the most part, envelopes are housed with their enclosed letters. Bulky envelopes were removed to the Envelopes folder, and either a photocopy of the envelope or a separation sheet was inserted in its stead. Envelopes for which no corresponding letter could be determined were placed in the Envelopes folder. </p><p>The letters to Henry Kitson are primarily from individuals and organizations who commissioned work from him. These letters often contain commentary by the correspondents regarding the pace of work and their level of satisfaction, as well as their specifications or suggestions for the works-in-progress. Certain correspondents are found much more frequently than others in the collection and, therefore, the related subject projects are more strongly represented. Among these correspondents are Blewett Lee (re: the Lt. Gen. Lee memorial), Thomas Bradley (re: the H Company sculpture), L. L. Conant, Wendell Endicott, and officers of the National Society of New England Women (re: the Pilgrim Maiden statue). Also in this series is considerable correspondence with Mead, Mason &amp; Co. (re: the Iowa Memorial), Roman Bronze Works and other providers of materials and services for Kitson's projects. </p><p>There is little correspondence in the collection from the Kitsons, numbering only five pieces, all of which appear to be written by Henry Kitson. These are foldered separately from correspondence received. </p><p>Also included are a few items between people other than the Kitsons (a librarian, a merchant) that are related to sculptures and memorials, and letters to unidentified recipients. Two pieces of correspondence are in French. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref16_hxt" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Letters Received: A - C</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1892/1932" type="inclusive">1892-1932</unitdate><container id="aspace_ea3d1b763ab57b36708c7dde4e6940f9" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_ea3d1b763ab57b36708c7dde4e6940f9" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref17_xt7" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Letters Received: D - M</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1901/1934" type="inclusive">1901-1934</unitdate><container id="aspace_2109d0f71d5a92b42a7423e082ae4d0c" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_2109d0f71d5a92b42a7423e082ae4d0c" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref18_dy8" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Letters Received: N -- R</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1896/1932" type="inclusive">1896-1932</unitdate><container id="aspace_4edf9ed4fe03a976cd9ff11fdff653bc" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_4edf9ed4fe03a976cd9ff11fdff653bc" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref19_3pg" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Letters Received: S -- Z</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1894/1930" type="inclusive">1894-1930</unitdate><container id="aspace_ac40cc8db7d81f33ada5f551eea5d3bd" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_ac40cc8db7d81f33ada5f551eea5d3bd" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref20_m6q" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Letters Received: Bradley, Thomas W.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1904/1906" type="inclusive">1904-1906</unitdate><container id="aspace_870b932af5507ec21c5f9348ee8c2cda" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_870b932af5507ec21c5f9348ee8c2cda" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref21_wbw" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Letters Received: Cole, Katharine H.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1920/1920" type="inclusive">1920</unitdate><container id="aspace_c51c1f87780be439375ce0c48f91c122" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_c51c1f87780be439375ce0c48f91c122" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref22_ks5" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Letters Received: Conant, L.

The bulk of this material is undated and its subjects are often unidentified. Notable identified photographs include those of Kitson subjects and works, such as Lt. Gen. Lee, Governor Banks, Robert Burns, the Parker statue, and others. Also included is a photographic series of head shots of Calvin Coolidge, apparently taken in preparation for a bust. Notable sketches include a caricature of (presumably) Henry Kitson, a rough drawing of the Endicott tablet, and details of the pedestal for the Newburyport "Volunteer." Most of the blueprints in the series pertain to the Sir Richard Saltonstall memorial, especially the lettering for it, at Watertown, Massachusetts.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref61_bvg"
