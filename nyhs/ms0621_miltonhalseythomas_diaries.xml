    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of the diaries of archivist and librarian Milton Halsey Thomas (1903-1977), covering the period 1915-1977. It also includes a 3-volume partial name index (1915-1971) and 20 volumes of travel journals (1963-1977), as well as a brief autobiography.</p><p>The diaries detail the development of Thomas's professional, intellectual, social, and sexual life. He writes about his relationships and social activities with his family, colleagues, friends, and girlfriends.  Thomas describes events and personalities at Columbia and Princeton Universities, his work in the libraries and archives, and people and events in New York City and Princeton, N.J. He includes comments on books and films, and observations on current national and international events. Travel diaries record his vacations to the Caribbean and Europe, including cruises.</p><p>Many entries reveal his ideas about social class, sex, religion, race, ethnicity, gender roles, education, and status.  A recurring theme throughout the diaries is Thomas' relations with women, particularly with potential girlfriends and with the women who work with him. Thomas discusses the circumstances in which he meets women, and his interactions and activities with them. He includes detailed descriptions and judgments about the women he meets, often in the context of his conflicting feelings about marriage and the qualities he would require in his ideal life partner. Taken as a whole, Thomas' diaries provide insight into the experiences of an academic  navigating life in the Greater New York area in the mid-20th century.</p><p>At the end of each volume, Thomas lists his most important dates of the year; these correspond with diary entries, and could provide a guide or starting point for researchers. The partial name index and brief autobiography may also help researchers navigate the diaries. The catalog record for this collection, found here:
