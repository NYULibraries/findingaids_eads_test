    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In 1949, the Personnel Department existed independently within Time Inc. with Edward Rhett as its director. Within the department are staff position for Employee Records and Benefits, Interviewing, Orientation, and Medical. </p><p>By 1960, Personnel added staff to oversee the central files. Outside of the Personnel Department, Time Inc. created a position for Corporate Staff Relations. Louis Gratz occupied this position in the 1960 department head list in the Time Inc. Reference Files.</p><p>By 1970, the department head list has the Personnel Office under Corporate overseen by Vice President of Administration and International Charles Bear. The Medical Office has separated from Personnel, but is an administrative unit overseen by Bear. Within Personnel, Charles Gleason, Jr. is the Vice President and Personnel Director, and William Trent is the Assistant Director. Other staff position remain the same as in the 1960 directory.</p><p>By 1980, the department head list has the Personnel Office under Corporate Administration with Robert Steed as Director and Deane Raley as Associate Director. The Medical Director is part of Personnel again. Personnel has added Affirmative Action Officers, a Director of Staff Development, and Employment Counselors.</p><p>The 1986 Management Directory lists Human Resources (HR) under the Corporate Group overseen by the Chief Administrative Officer. HR has Directors of Affirmative Action, Benefits, Compensation, and a Medical Department. </p><p>A memorandum in Assistant Corporate Editor David Maness's files states that John Bingle is Steed's successor.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>Time Inc.

<p>The Time Inc. Human Resources and Personnel Records were processed by Holly Deakyne in November 2016. The original folders were retained although some documents were transferred to archival  containers in instances of overcrowding. Deakyne created the inventory and other descriptive notes to produced this finding aid.</p><p>In 2021, after additional records were located and more information on the structure of the company found, Deakyne moved the series of Director of Administration Rosemarie Di Sapio Files from this record group to the Time Inc. Corporate Administration Records (MS 3009-RG 5) as Vice President of Administration Rosemarie Di Sapio Files.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The Time Inc. Human Resources and Personnel Records include files from Robert Steed, Vice President, Personnel Director; and John Bingle, Vice President, Human Resources. Many of the files from 1939 through the 1950s look like they were retained or collected for reference reasons. </p><p>Topics include Time Inc. budgets and budgets for the Human Resources and Personnel departments; Time Inc. strategic plans; union negotiations and contracts; transitioning employees during business mergers and takeovers such as with the Washington <title render="italic">Star</title>; agenda and materials from the Compensation Policy Committee and Administrative Committee; compensation plans; employee stock ownership plans; healthcare management proposals; implementation of databases or other systems; insurance summaries; pension plans; memoranda discussing implementation or changes of benefits and bonuses; summer internships; Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) changes; marketing materials from outside sources; Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) forms; and employee handbooks. </p><p>While HR and Personnel are not the offices of record for some materials (budgets, strategic plans), these materials are retained here in the event they are the only record.</p><p>Because of the limited date range for these records, it is possible earlier records related to personnel matters were interfiled into the Time Inc. Subject Files (MS 3009-RG 1), Time Inc. Bio Files (MS 3009-RG 2) or Time Inc. Reference Files (MS 3009-RG 3). The majority of Human Resources and Personnel records created after the mid-1980s may have been handled using the retention policies established at that time and never archived.</p>  </scopecontent>
