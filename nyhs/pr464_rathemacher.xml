    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Henry Rathemacher, a son of German immigrants, was born in New York City in 1895. On May 4, 1917, he enlisted as a private in Company C, 7th Infantry, New York National Guard. The 7th New York Infantry was reorganized as the 107th Infantry Regiment in October 1917, at which time Rathemacher was promoted to corporal. Following training at Camp Wadsworth, Spartanburg, South Carolina, the 107th was shipped overseas in May 1918, where it saw combat during the Battle of the Somme. Rathemacher was honorably discharged on March 20, 1919. On August 30, 1941, he married Hildegarde Hupfauf (1901-1980), a native of Louisville, Kentucky, at Manhattan's famous "Little Church Around the Corner." With his brother, Henry Rathemacher co-owned a champagne importing firm. He retired to Florida, where he died in 1985.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists mainly of photographs documenting the military career of Henry Rathemacher (1895-1985), who served as an army private and corporal in the 107th Infantry Regiment during World War I. Many of the photographs appear to have been taken while Rathemacher was in training at Camp Wadsworth, Spartanburg, South Carolina, before being shipped overseas, where he saw action during the Battle of the Somme in France. Also present are photographs, menus, and ceremonial programs from reunion banquets for the 107th Infantry and other organizations. And the collection includes a series of photographs taken at the dinner celebrating Rathemacher's 1941 marriage to Hildegarde Hupfauf (1901-1980).</p>  </scopecontent>
