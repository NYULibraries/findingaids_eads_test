    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Although perhaps best know for her then-controversial New York Sun article, "Why I Let My 9-Year-Old Ride the Subway Alone" (2008), subsequent book, "Free Range Kids: How to Raise Safe, Self-Reliant Children (Without Going Nuts With Worry)" (2009), and her activism for the "free-range parenting" movement, Lenore Skenazy has had a long career in journalism. Before moving to the short-lived New York Sun (folded 2008), Skenazy was for fourteen years a regular contributor to the New York Daily News, where her byline headed the "Only in New York" and "New York Stories" Sunday magazine columns.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of letters—some typed, most handwritten, and some on postcards—submitted by readers of the New York Daily News hoping to win one of the weekly contests run in Lenore Skenazy's "Only in New York" and "New York Stories" columns in the Sunday magazine section. The "Only in New York" contests ran from 1988 through at least 1990; the "New York Stories" contests from 1991 or 1992 through 1995 or later. Each week Skenazy posed a question (some of them reworked from previous contests) in which readers were asked to describe the most disappointing thing to have happened on a vacation, or the most creative way they tortured a sibling (or vice versa), or the strangest thing they witnessed at a funeral, or the wildest pickup line they ever used or heard. (See the container list for the complete questions for the entries in the collection; note that the collection is incomplete.) From the most entertaining submissions Skenazy published first, second, and third place winners. In addition to the pleasure of seeing their words in print, winners could expect to receive a "Handsome Keepsake Contest Winner's Plaque" (for "Only in New York") or a t-shirt with the column title printed on it (for "New York Stories).</p>  </scopecontent>
