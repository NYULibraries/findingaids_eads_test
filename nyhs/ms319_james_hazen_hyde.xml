    <abstract id="aspace_b251e63012b6c0f196ff9552e793c4d7">Collection consists of correspondence, diaries, scrapbooks, photographs, and other papers of James Hazen Hyde (1876-1959). The papers are especially strong in two areas: documentation of Hyde's efforts at expanding knowledge of French culture in America from circa 1894-1905 through the Cercle Français de l'Université Harvard and the Fédération de l'Alliance Francaise, and documentation of his activities as an expatriate living in France from 1906 to 1941.  His correspondence includes a large collection of letters to and from his mother, Annie F. Hyde, from 1891-1921; documentation of Red Cross activities in France during World War I; and Hyde's ongoing initiatives to expand Franco-American cultural exchange. His correspondence and diaries (which date from 1922-1940) include extensive references to Hyde's social life, anecdotes and comments about prominent persons, especially diplomats, government officials, military officers, academics, journalists, industrialists, and those from cultural circles from France, the United States, and Britain. Most of the collection is in French.</abstract>

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>James Hazen Hyde made various donations in a piecemeal fashion to N-YHS over the course of the 1940s and 1950s. This collection includes most of the personal papers he donated. The various acquisition dates for the materials in Series III-VII are noted at the series level. All those materials were donated with Hyde's stipulation that they would not be made available until after his death, which occurred in 1959.</p><p>It is not clear when the correspondence in Series I and II was donated. At points in the 1940s and 1950s, Hyde informed N-YHS's director at the time that he was going through the correspondence to identify what he would donate (he was discarding "uninteresting and personal letters"), again with the stipulation that it would not be available until after his death. A list of notable correspondents is in the archive from 1959 so the correspondence was donated no later than then.</p>  </acqinfo>

<p>Over the course of the 1940s-1950s, Hyde made many donations to New-York Historical of manuscripts, photographs, prints, objects, and other material. These arrived in a piecemeal fashion and were separated to various departments and collections in the library and museum. Following are some of the Hyde donations related to this collection:</p><p>The following manuscripts were donated by Hyde and cataloged under separate call numbers:</p><p>* A small collection of six letters titled "James Hazen Hyde collection" (call AHMC - Hyde, James Hazen)</p><p>* George Henry Nettleton letter to James Hazen Hyde, 1947 March 24 (call AHMC - Nettleton, George Henry)</p><p>* Woodrow Wilson letter to James H. Hyde, 1903 March 16 (call AHMC - Wilson, Woodrow – Hyde)</p><p>* An exchange between Hyde and Charles Francis Adams in the Charles Francis Adams papers (call AHMC - Adams, Charles Francis (1835-1915))</p><p>N-YHS's institutional archive holds correspondence related to Hyde's various donations. See the New-York Historical Society General Correspondence record group (NYHS-RG 2) and search for Hyde.</p><p>The Department of Prints, Photographs and Architectural Collections holds the James H. Hyde collection of allegorical prints of the four continents (PR-27).</p><p>A search on James Hazen Hyde in N-YHS's catalog, Bobcat, will yield other print matter related to Hyde, including works authored by Hyde.</p><p>Some of the correspondence files in this collection refer to Hyde's efforts to create a "New Theatre" in New York. These happen to be outliers from a larger set of correspondence originally in Hyde's files. Among the many donations Hyde offered to N-YHS in the 1950s was his "dossier" concerning Winthrop Ames and the development of the New Theatre, which opened in 1909. N-YHS's director at the time suggested to Hyde that those papers be donated to the New York Public Library, which held extensive related material. These can be found at NYPL under the title James Hazen Hyde papers (call MssCol 1471).</p>  </relatedmaterial>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of James Hazen Hyde's correspondence, diaries, scrapbooks, photographs, and other papers dating primarily from the 1890s, when he was an undergraduate student at Harvard, through 1940, shortly before he returned to the United States from France. Hyde's involvement with the Cercle Français de l'Université Harvard and the Fédération de l'Alliance Francaise in the 1890s-circa 1904 are well-documented in correspondence and scrapbooks. Hyde's diaries begin in 1922 and end in 1940, that is, for the latter half of his time residing in France. They include details of his social engagements, anecdotes and comments about prominent persons, descriptions of his travel, and visits to cultural events and institutions, and include clippings, theatre and opera programs, and other print matter related to his activities and interests. </p><p>Hyde's correspondence files extend principally from the 1890s to the 1930s, and especially pertain to his interest in Franco-American relations, e.g. American Field Service Fellowships, arranging American lecture tours by French professors and vice versa, and his work in the American Red Cross in France during World War I. Hyde's correspondents include  diplomats, government officials, military officers, academics, journalists, industrialists, and those from cultural circles, though the extent and substance of each is uneven.  The container list of the finding aid includes an inventory of the correspondents. Especially rich is a large collection of correspondence between Hyde and his mother, Annie Fitch Hyde, from 1891 to 1921. Much of the correspondence files include both incoming and Hyde's outgoing letters. Although the correspondence with his mother and others touch at times on financial and business matters, there seems to be relatively little on Hyde's activities as an Equitable Assurance Company officer or in his other commercial enterprises prior to departing the U.S. in 1905.  </p><p>One set of bound volumes in the collection hold congratulatory letters to Hyde on his promotions within the French Legion of Honor in the 1920s. Another set are memorial books with condolence letters and other documents related to the death of Hyde's father, Henry Baldwin Hyde in 1899. There are a few family photographs and diplomas/certificates.</p><p>An extensive amount of the collection, likely well more than half, is in French. Some, especially print matter in the diaries, is in German.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>James Hazen Hyde (1876-1959) was born in New York City, the son of Henry Baldwin Hyde (1834-1899), who had founded the Equitable Life Assurance Company of the United States in 1859, and Annie (Fitch) Hyde (1845-1922). Hyde attended Cutler School in New York and entered Harvard College in 1894. At some point in his youth, Hyde picked up the nickname "Caleb" and correspondence from family and some friends used that name when addressing him.  </p><p>A lifelong Francophile, Hyde joined the Cercle Francais de l'Universite Harvard, a society of students interested in French culture and literature and proficient in the language. While president of the club in 1897, Hyde received from his father $30,000 to form a trust to fund annual French lectures at Harvard under the auspices of the Cercle Francais. The first of these was delivered in March 1898 by René Doumic. Hyde's initiative led to him being named a member (Chevalier) of the French Legion of Honor in 1900. He would be promoted to the highest ranks in the Legion in the 1920s. In 1904, Hyde supported a counterpart program in France, whereby American academics from Harvard would lecture at the Sorbonne and France's provincial universities; Barrett Wendell was the first of these lecturers. (See the Harvard Register of 1905-06, page 88 (on-line) and, especially, Hyde's description to George Nettleton in this collection of the Cercle and later lectures and Hyde's involvement with them.)</p><p>After graduating from Harvard in 1898 with degrees in German and French, Hyde joined his father at the Equitable in the high-ranking position of Second Vice-President. At the time, Hyde's father, Henry, was president and controlling shareholder of the company he had founded, having built it into a firm with perhaps 600,000 policyholders and $400 million of assets. Henry died the following year, in 1899, at age 65, bequeathing to his son the controlling shares. Equitable's First Vice-President James W. Alexander ascended to the presidency and Hyde advanced to First Vice-President. </p><p>Over the next few years, Hyde expanded his financial interests, taking on directorships of various banking and other firms. His wealth also grew and his passion for French culture continued, both of which he flaunted. And his position as First Vice-President at Equitable put him in line to become company president. These factors culminated in Hyde's downfall as a businessman in 1905. In January of that year he hosted an ostentatious Versailles-themed costume ball for New York's wealthy elite. The extreme extravagance of the event led to not only general criticism in the press, but investigations into whether Hyde had misappropriated company funds for the purpose. Those at the Equitable looking to oust him from his position of power used the opportunity to deride him as reckless and unfit for the management of a financial firm. By the end of the year Hyde had resigned his position at the Equitable and his many directorships and sold his controlling interest in Equitable to Thomas Fortune Ryan. In December 1905, he sailed to France, where he would live until 1941, returning to America only when forced in the face of Nazi Germany's defeat of France.</p><p>During his years in France, Hyde leveraged his wealth to rebuild his reputation, remaking himself as a philanthropist, patron of the arts, and cultural ambassador. As a foundation, he expanded on the French-American cultural exchanges he had begun during his college years. In 1911, when Harvard formalized its own exchange of professors with the Sorbonne, Hyde redirected trust funds to support a continuing series of Harvard lecturers visiting the provinces. He maintained relationships with American diplomats, journalists, military officials, and others, acting as an unofficial guide to French culture and point of introduction to important French contacts. He traveled widely in Europe, and also to the Middle and Far East, enabling him to be a source of information for Americans new to the European scene. He delivered public remarks at times and wrote newspaper articles. During World War I, he gave over his home at 18 rue Adolphe Yvon in Paris to the Red Cross to use as a hospital and he worked as aide to Colonel Harvey D. Gibson, Commissioner for France of the American Red Cross. </p><p>After WWI, when the American Field Service created its Fellowships for French Universities, Hyde was on the Advisory Board. In the 1920s, Hyde was on the Executive Committee of the Continental Division of the American University in Europe, among other positions involving cultural exchange. As a philanthropist, among the many projects he supported were Albert Lythgoe's Egyptian archaeological expeditions and the acquisition and restoration of Madame Pompadour's residence at Versailles. He collected art, including a large number of allegorical prints now in the collections of New-York Historical Society. In recognition of his cultural and philanthropic services, Hyde was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1928 and was elected to the French Academy of Political and Moral Sciences in 1938, among other honors.</p><p>In 1913 in Paris, Hyde married for the first time and his wedding was emblematic of his French-American interconnections. His bride was Countess Louis de Gontaut-Biron, whose first husband, a member of the old French aristocracy, had died in 1907. She was American, her maiden name being Marthe Leishman, the daughter of a former United States ambassador to Germany. Hyde's best man was Myron T. Herrick, the American ambassador to France. The Hydes had one son, Henry Baldwin Hyde (1915-1997), and they divorced in 1918; the New York Times reported that the cause was Marthe's sympathies toward the Germans during World War I. Nonetheless, as Hyde's diaries show, Marthe and Hyde stayed in touch over the years, notably in connection with their son; Marthe sent congratulations to Hyde on the occasion of his promotion to Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1923 (see Series V, Volume 3). </p><p>Hyde remarried in 1930, to Countess Ella Matuschka, who was also an American (from Detroit) and who was previously married to a German officer. Hyde left her in 1931 and was sued for divorce in 1932. That same year, Hyde married a third time to Madame Thome (nee Stephanie Dervaux?), whose husband, Andre Thome, had been killed at Verdun. </p><p>On his return to the United States in 1941, Hyde lived at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel in New York and summered in Saratoga Springs. Over time in the 1940s and 1950s, he donated his papers and some of his artwork to the New-York Historical Society. He died of pneumonia in 1959 at the Gideon Putnam Hotel in Saratoga Springs.</p>  </bioghist>

Correspondents include both French and American politicians, diplomats, military officers, journalists, editors, writers, scholars, and others. Most of the correspondence is in French. Subject matter pertains to his interest in Franco-American relations, American Field Service Fellowships, American lecture tours by French professors and vice versa, his work for the American Red Cross in France during World War I, his social life, philanthropy, support for the arts and cultural endeavors, anecdotes and comments about prominent persons. Some correspondence dates from the 1890s and early years of the twentieth century, before Hyde left the United States for France. Letters from that early period generally concern business matters.  The series also includes copies of some remarks given by Hyde in public presentations after World War I.</p><p>Several of the files include an index card with typed explanatory notes about the correspondent or subject. It seems likely that these were prepared by Hyde as he prepared the files for donation to N-YHS. This view is based on an exchange Hyde had with N-YHS director R.W.G. Vail in 1950 in which Hyde asked whether he should annotate the original documents with comments, to which Vail suggested the addition of typed memos to the file instead. (See N-YHS's institutional archive, General Correspondence record group (NYHS-RG 2).</p><p>The container list includes a detailed list of most of the correspondents in the series.

Eliot, Waldron H. Rand, Jr., A. Lawrence Lowell, Archibald Cary Coolidge, C.H. Van Tyne, Jules Coulet, James W. Garner, and Henry Munroe. The principal topic concerns arrangements for Harvard to send various professors to lecture in France. These arrangements, especially in terms of the specific professors selected, involve both institutional and geopolitical considerations. There are some documents concerning related efforts, such as lecturers sent to Spain and a 1908 plan for English assistants to be placed in German schools. The bulk of the correspondence ends in 1922; two letters from 1935 include one from James B.

There are two 1910 notes from Edith Rockefeller McCormick, and these are generally courtesies.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ac2f206564d0efb1add0bc93429a1ce5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rod, Edouard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1903-1908</unitdate><container id="aspace_fc5970c6b7d2b9ea7100d39f1cb82b2c" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_fc5970c6b7d2b9ea7100d39f1cb82b2c" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_d926fac2ea7c28c9dd8aadf76058182c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rodin, Auguste</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1904(?)-1912</unitdate><container id="aspace_ef1d930ee595638c340cb8eec7346973" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_ef1d930ee595638c340cb8eec7346973" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_aa8fef6ed86a3411572a6e33e754e388" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ronciere, Charles de la</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1922-1931</unitdate><container id="aspace_c628bf349009de6b0241863d55b63321" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_c628bf349009de6b0241863d55b63321" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_e49410b1b02332121a069f5b7809fa9c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Roussillon, Jean</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1931-1932</unitdate><container id="aspace_5ef8b99831e1723d245a896d2ce0e0bb" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_5ef8b99831e1723d245a896d2ce0e0bb" type="Folder">6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_581c552a5dca3338b04bdbe54dc31f9f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Also includes a copy of one letter from Berthelot to Andre Tardieu.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0d030bf4bf3cd2f91f38b332a7e90fa1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Roz, Firmin</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1912-1929</unitdate><container id="aspace_798b1f626f74b5e315631134aa53ea95" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_798b1f626f74b5e315631134aa53ea95" type="Folder">7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_81025c646a02304bc6312fc3eaeb77b8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes, among many other matters, notes on a meeting with Kingsley Porter (1923).</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ff0bca3d385e1be6c75cc96a68a5363a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Russell, Henry</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1909-1916</unitdate><container id="aspace_b5aedd7056ba8fd0234bc4025f59900d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_b5aedd7056ba8fd0234bc4025f59900d" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_7960501f972ebcc83652f125cc6e45f9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ryan, Thomas Fortune</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1903-1906, 1917</unitdate><container id="aspace_9c0108c002a46f38dae91c28957e00d0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_9c0108c002a46f38dae91c28957e00d0" type="Folder">9</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bbaded646e656997c891b1f22f47d90b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Early correspondence appears to relate primarily to matters concerning directorships of a bank and to Hyde's appointment of certain Equitable stock in his will.

There are a very few letters that are either from Hyde's father, Henry Baldwin Hyde, or include the father's notes added to some of Annie's letters. There are also a few letters to Hyde from his mother's caregivers, Camille (letters in French) and Rippe. </p><p>The earliest correspondence preserved in these files is primarily letters from Annie to Hyde. These are generally undated but the context indicates that these largely date from the 1890s while Hyde is away at school. Annie's letters make clear that Hyde routinely wrote to her, and she reciprocated with short affectionate notes about family updates, health, travels, and the like. By about 1899, typed copies of Hyde's letters appear in the files and for the balance of the files, Hyde's outgoing letters predominate, with occasional telegrams from Annie. There is relatively little correspondence for about 1903-1906, but there are many carbon copies of Hyde's letters to his mother from about 1907 to her death in mid-1922. 
Hyde wrote regularly to his mother, and these letters place on emphasis on noting who he dined or socialized with throughout the week, though the letters seldom mention the substance of conversations at these meetings. Hyde traveled with some frequency and he wrote in some detail about these trips, including those to Singapore, Guatemala, and many locations in Europe and in France. He wrote of lectures he gave, observations during World War I (though, as he notes, these are constrained by the censors), assistance given to the Red Cross during the war, his health, and the growth of his child, Henry. A certain tension surfaces at times in the letters, particularly over financial matters, which include Annie's sales of real estate, Hyde's finances, investments, and their handling of the Henry Baldwin Hyde estate.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_7d1811ae355d2f645a68186500b0b107"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The original order of the series was, roughly, reverse chronological. To facilitate use, the documents were rearranged to a chronological order. Undated letters, which are mostly from Annie and are likely from the 1890s-1900s, are in the opening folders. Pins were used extensively by Hyde to connect pages of documents; these were removed during processing so care should be taken during use not to mix the sheets up.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_b49a2445ab95c6b0eca85e11ac3b4ff6"><head>Processing Information</head><p>The series was processed by archivist Jennifer Gargiulo.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_d6da6c394bf6b7c8b711a1dbb37c0df6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence with Annie Hyde (9 of 16 folders)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">circa 1891-1912, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_fe94cd8ae3f5082e51e554c725d3e61b" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_fe94cd8ae3f5082e51e554c725d3e61b" type="Folder">1-9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_0bbe9581d2f3ee6c939d58d8aae550a1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence with Annie Hyde (7 of 16 folders)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1913-1922</unitdate><container id="aspace_03b7ab44025ffbee1aeaac55e6087827" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">14</container><container parent="aspace_03b7ab44025ffbee1aeaac55e6087827" type="Folder">1-7</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_b1d924e5d4f2b9815ff2f52a9674de71" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series III.

He consequently founded an organization linking all these societies together: the Federation of French Alliances in the United States and Canada (Federation de l'Alliance Francaise aux Etats-Unis et au Canada). Among the Franco-American societies affiliated with the Federation, and represented in this collection, was the l'Alliance Francaise de New York. A principal activity of the central organization was bringing French lecturers to tour the countries. Hyde became the first president of the Federation and the secretariat was located in the offices of the Equitable. In 1903, Hyde was succeeded in the presidency by Julian Leroy White of the Alliance Francaise of Baltimore. In subsequent years, with Hyde's departure from the Equitable and the United States, especially after about 1908, he was no longer involved with the Alliance or Federation, though he continued to be involved with cultural exchanges in France. In the early 1920s, new leadership of the Federation, notably President Frank D.

The gap relates to Hyde's relative lack of involvement in the Federation at that time. </p><p>For the earlier period, Hyde's correspondence is principally with the officers of the Federation, its affiliated chapters in various cities of the United States, and officers of the sponsoring Alliance in Paris. Much of this earlier correspondence is directed to or from L.V. Gofflot, the Secretary General of the Federation. Among the many correspondents are Felix Weill, J. LeRoy White, L. Fiedler, Henry Cachard, W.H. Perkins, Rene Millet, Camille Thurwanger, A. Bousquet, Maxime Ingres, Henry L. Rippe, F. C. de Sumichrast, Anatole Le Braz, Julien Tiersot, Vicomte G. d'Avenel, Robert Lebaudy, Alcee Fortier, M. Jusserand, George Lamouret, E.H. Goulesque, Frank L. Warren Jr., Camille Gorde, and Henry Bargy. In the later period, the bulk of the correspondence is with the Federation's President Frank Pavey and Secretary General Felix Weill.</p><p>The contents are primarily in French, though the later correspondence from Pavey is most commonly in English. The subject matter often concerns plans for lecturers from France to tour America, but administrative, governance, and financial matters are also discussed. The correspondence of 1922 includes reference to the reasons for Hyde reducing his activity in the Federation and his interest in re-engaging at that time.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_41ff3ccab115a8f06b3e81f6df2cbe1f"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The documents have largely been left as found by the processing archivist, with some changes.

Filling 94 loose leaf binders, the diaries' physical bulk consists of newspaper clippings and other print matter from American, French, British, and German publications glued to backing paper, sometimes with Hyde's brief, typed comments. A principal example are obituaries or other articles referring to a person's death; on these, Hyde typically recalled the extent of his relationship with the person, his impressions, and perhaps an anecdote. Threaded throughout the volumes are pages with Hyde's daily journal entries. These are typewritten, and references in the diaries (as well as occasional phonetic misspellings of English words) suggest that they were maintained by Hyde's secretaries at his dictation/direction rather than directly by his hand. The pages of each volume are numbered and many (perhaps all) volumes have an index to their content. The entries are in English, except that Hyde rendered quotations in French when, presumably, that is how he originally heard them, and in cases where Hyde used French to better express himself on a point. The clippings and other print matter are mostly English and French, but there are also a sizable number in German.</p><p>Each daily entry extends to no more than two typed pages, and typically they are less than one full page. The general content of the entries is fairly consistent: an outline of Hyde's activities for the day with reference to the names of individuals he dined with, traveled with, attended a cultural event with, or otherwise encountered during the day, and to his physical condition. To these Hyde would commonly add a brief judgment, such as whether a person was pleasant or attractive, conversation interesting or not, the quality of a theatrical performance, museum exhibition, or other cultural event. The range of Hyde's social connections is impressive and includes American, French, British, and German diplomats, politicians, journalists and editors, industrialists and financiers, military officers, art historians and other academics, and individuals from the worlds of classical music and the theatre. Despite the richness of his connections, Hyde is inconsistent at documenting the substance of his many conversations. He documents various anecdotes, gossip, points of history, and other items of interest he hears but these seem lean compared to the settings and individuals involved. He seems most descriptive when discussing visits to museums, performances and other cultural matters. He seems the most reserved in conveying insight into himself, his business/financial matters, and his opinions on geopolitical events. It may be that the intermediation of secretaries, as well as his status as a foreigner living in France and his travels in countries such as Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy, called for discretion in deciding what to dictate and have written down.</p><p>Despite its shortcomings, the diaries do trace the experience of a wealthy, knowledgeable American expatriate in France from the years after World War I to the invasion of France early in World War II. Hyde's observations primarily concern geopolitics and culture, flavored with social gossip. Various observations, speculations, opinions about Germany and its relation to France and the rest of Europe are recorded here and there, and become more frequent and darker in the late 1930s, especially during the German annexations in 1938 of Austria and the Sudetenland. In this context, a notable thread that also appears increasingly over time in the diaries is Hyde's identification of individuals who are Jews; this is especially jarring as individuals Hyde often interacts with in the diaries (e.g., Hans Tietze) are suddenly referenced in that light.</p><p>Hyde frequently attends the opera and theatre, and even movies, perhaps especially when traveling to Berlin, Vienna, and London. The diaries include many of the programs he collected at these performances. The stage actors Sacha Guitry and Yvonne Printemps appear frequently in Hyde's diary and there are some programs from their performances of Guitry's plays.</p><p>In processing the diaries, the archivist skimmed Hyde's entries and attempted to identify any particular items of interest in the folder level scope notes below. The absence of any note at the folder level simply indicates that the above summary likely captures the general content of that volume. The folder level scope notes also outline when Hyde was traveling outside France; they do not necessarily document his travel within France or within a country he visited. The scope notes attempt to identify entries with some biographical significance concerning Hyde. These notes were developed within time constraints and so patrons should not rely exclusively on them.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_1c5e37c171431883c098aa10b014e7e6"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The diaries are in their original chronological order, by volume.

The Cercle scrapbooks range from Hyde's entry in the club in 1894 to the end of his active involvement with it upon his departure for France in 1905. The first five Cercle scrapbooks, through 1900, are especially rich with correspondence and other documents reflecting Hyde's deep involvement as an energetic officer of the club and as the financial source for the annual lecture series he instituted in 1898. After 1900, the Cercle scrapbooks are mostly clippings with some ephemera. Nonetheless, the Cercle scrapbooks provide rich documentation of the organization's activities for the years they cover, notably in the expansion of the Cercle under Hyde from a local club catering to its members to one having a national and international reputation and impact. In addition to documentation of the lecture series, including the national reach of the lectures, the scrapbooks document the annual plays performed by the Cercle. Later years include images of the casts in costume. The scrapbooks do not hold any official records of the Cercle, such as meeting minutes or financial reports.</p><p>The one volume of material concerning the Alliance Francais includes mostly clippings for the years 1900-1903, but there is also informative program lists and other ephemera related to the Alliance's activities for the first few years of its existence. The Barrett Wendell scrapbook holds primarily clippings with some ephemera.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_b78d55bd38c9d2f381b6b4f049e9d0ec"><head>Processing Information</head><p>The series was processed by archivist Larry Weimer.</p></processinfo><acqinfo id="aspace_5318f3bb2bd858d295b20da1678ecb7c"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>All but the scrapbook concerning the Alliance Francaise were a gift of James Hazen Hyde in April 1947.
