    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Editorial Services was established as a central corporate division in 1967 with four departments: Bureau of Editorial Services; Editorial Production; the Photo Lab; and the Picture Collection. These departments supported the research, editorial, and publishing efforts of the Time Inc. magazines. Departments and offices within Editorial Services reorganized frequently. </p><p>Bureau of Editorial Services, transferred from the <title render="italic">Time</title> Editorial Department in 1967, was sometimes known as the "Word Morgue". In 1971, it was renamed the Library.</p><p>Editorial Production transferred from the <title render="italic">Time</title> Editorial Department in 1967 and contained the Photon and Copy Processing operations. In 1970 Editorial Production ceased Photon operations and became synonymous with Copy Processing. In 1981 Editorial Production/Copy Processing detached from Editorial Services and transferred to separate management.</p><p>The Photo Lab transferred from the <title render="italic">Life</title> Editorial Department in 1967 and remained a department until Editorial Services closed in 2001.</p><p>The Picture Collection transferred from the <title render="italic">Life</title> Editorial Department in 1967. While at <title render="italic">Life</title>, it was known as the Picture Morgue then the <title render="italic">Life</title> Picture Collection. </p><p>Prior to closing, <title render="italic">Life</title> magazine operated the Time-Life Syndication Service. After <title render="italic">Life</title> ceased operations, Editorial Services established the Time-Life Picture Agency, also known as the Time-Life Picture Service, within the Picture Collection to take over syndication services. </p><p>Other syndication offices within Editorial Services included the <title render="italic">Life</title> Picture Service, Time &amp; Life Syndication and TimePix. Time &amp; Life Syndication transferred to Editorial Services around 1994 and may have been an office created by the reorganization of <title render="italic">Life</title> Picture Service and Time Pix Syndication (a <title render="italic">Time</title> editorial division) in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Time Inc. established TimePix around 1999 replacing Time &amp; Life Syndication.</p>    <chronlist>

<p>Nora Soto conducted the initial processing of and research on the history of the Editorial Services Records in 2020. Holly Deakyne finalized processing in 2020. The original folders were retained when possible, although some documents were transferred to archival containers in instances of overcrowding, if the original folder was in poor condition or undersized, or if no original folder was present. Deakyne created the inventory and descriptive notes for this record group using notes provided by Soto.</p>  </processinfo>
