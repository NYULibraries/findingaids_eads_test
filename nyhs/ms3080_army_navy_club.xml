<p>The Army and Navy Club of New York was founded in 1933 under the name of the Military-Naval Club.  According to their Articles of Incorporation, their purpose was to "promote social interaction of the commissioned officers, both active and retired, of the military and naval forces of the United States of America and foreign country and such other persons as may be qualified for membership hereunder, to establish a common meeting ground for such officers and other persons within the City of New York."  They originally used space belonging to the Columbia Club, and for many years were located at 4 East 43rd St.</p>  </bioghist>
