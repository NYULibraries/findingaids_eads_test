    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Photographer Ron Galella was born in the Bronx, New York, in 1931. He served as a United States Air Force photographer (1951-1955) during the Korean War and later attended the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles, California, graduating with a degree in photojournalism in 1958. He began taking candid photographs of celebrities, eventually making it his specialty, becoming one of the leading edge of "papazazzi" photographers. Jackie Kennedy Onassis was perhaps his most famous subject, or target, depending on one's perspective as Galella's relentless approach often received a negative, even violent, response from those he photographed.</p>  </bioghist>
