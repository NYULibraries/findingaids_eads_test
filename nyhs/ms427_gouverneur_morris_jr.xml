    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The documents in this collection relate to Gouverneur Morris, Jr.'s role as a railroad developer. They include surveys, estimates, legal documents, correspondence, proposals, agreements, and numerous accounts, bills, and receipts. The four box collection is organized by railroad and a brief history of each is included in the series descriptions. Railroads that are represented by a few documents are together in one series. The documents pertain to him as an investor, and often a building contractor for numerous railroads. His development activities involved him with various companies including Morris, Miller, &amp; Shuyler or Morris, Miller, Baker, and Co., etc.</p><p>The bulk of the collection relates to his role as a developer in the extension of the New York and Harlem Railroad to Albany, New York. The documents provide details on stocks, financing, contractors, materials, and the amount of work completed. The contracts and payroll records provide details on labor and wages. Information on property bought for the extension, including some of Morris's property in Morrisania, is also included. The quantity of records for the other railroads in the collection is much smaller and generally includes agreements, contracts, correspondence, and financial documents. </p><p>The collection supports research on railroad construction, particularly the New York and Harlem Railroad Albany extension. Most of the collection pertains to the building of railroads rather than their operation. Although the collection contains some information about Gouverneur Morris, Jr.'s property and stocks, there is no personal information about him or his better known father, Gouverneur Morris.</p>  </scopecontent>

Because Harlem was quite rural at this time, the only existing travel means between Manhattan and Harlem were steamboats and stagecoaches. The New York &amp; Harlem Railroad was built between 1837 and 1841 and extended from City Hall to the Harlem River, as in the original design. In 1840, the New York State legislature granted the New York and Harlem Railroad rights to build a bridge across the Harlem River and extend to the New York and Albany's Railroad Line. Gouverneur Morris, Jr, then on the Board of Directors of the railroad, was entrusted to purchase the land. </p><p>In 1846, the New York and Albany Company was sold and the New York and Harlem Railroad bought the rights to complete the line to Albany. By 1852, the New York and Harlem Railroad had been extended 131 miles to Chatham Four Corners, New York, where it connected to an existing railroad line that went to Albany. In 1864, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired a majority of NY &amp; HRR stock and by 1869 had consolidated the New York and Harlem Railroad with the New York and Hudson River Railroad to become the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. </p><p>Most of the documents in this series relate to the Albany extension of the New York and Harlem Railroad, including the bridge built over the Harlem River. This series contains details on the progress of construction and includes estimates and plans as well as statements of work completed and payroll records. The documents illustrate to Gouverneur Morris's role in the railroad as a significant stockholder, a member of the Board of Directors, and a contractor with the company Morris, Miller, and Schuyler (Gouverneur Morris, George Schuyler and Sidney Miller) for building the railroad and its extension. Many of the property documents pertain to Gouverneur Morris since sections of the railroad were to be built through his property in Morrisiana. The large number of accounts, bills, and receipts in the series detail the materials, labor, and property needed to construct the railroad.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>Greene, Joseph Warren, Jr. <title type="simple" render="italic">New York City's First Railroad: The New York and Harlem (1832-1867)</title>.

The Illinois Central Railroad was the first railroad company to receive a federal land grant. Despite the fact that the land was granted from the government in return for a percentage of the income of the railroad, the company still had trouble finding investors. It opened its first section to Chicago in 1852 and the line was finished in 1856. The account documents and correspondence in this subseries relate to Gouverneur Morris's stock holdings in the railroad. His involvement in the construction of the railroad is unclear. </p><p>Sources:</p><p>Corliss, Carlton J. <title type="simple" render="italic">Main Line of Mid-America: the Story of the Illinois Central</title>.
