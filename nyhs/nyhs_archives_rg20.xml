The bulk of the records range from the 1970s into the early twenty-first century, though there is important earlier material, including acquisition and other documents concerning the John J. Audubon watercolors and the Henry Abbott Egyptian collection. The most extensive portions of the record group relate to exhibitions and loans, and those files are rich with checklists, images, loan documentation, publicity material, research files, comment books, wall
texts and labels, design elements, budgets and funding requests, and other like matter. The curatorial and collection management files include documents concerning proposed exhibitions, general exhibition scheduling, research inquiries, offers of objects for accession, object surveys, recommendations to the Board Museum Collection Committee, conservation, and other museum matters. There are also many object images, especially for paintings and drawings.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>From its founding in 1804, the New-York Historical Society (N-YHS) collected paintings, drawings and other museum objects, more commonly referred to as "cabinet" objects in the early 19th century. The collecting of these objects became significantly more ambitious in the late 1850s when N-YHS finally moved from a series of relatively small rented or donated quarters into a building of its own at 2nd Avenue and 11th Street in lower Manhattan. Almost immediately upon occupying this new building, N-YHS acquired the art collection formerly held by the New York Gallery of the Fine Arts, which was built on the private collection of merchant Luman Reed and included such works as Thomas Cole's <emph render="italic">Course of Empire</emph> series.</p><p>Despite N-YHS's stated focus in its founding documents on American and New York state history, its actual collecting often deviated from this charge. Ancient coins and medals and natural history objects were among the early deviations. With the expanded space at the 2nd Avenue building, and perhaps with the expectation of establishing a Museum of Antiquities, Science and Art in Central Park, in the 1860s N-YHS acquired many artifacts that would be obviously out of scope by the twentieth century. These included the Abbott Collection of Egyptian antiquities, James Lenox's ancient Nineveh sculptures, and European Old Masters from Thomas J. Bryan's collection. But this acquisitiveness also led in 1863 to the purchase of one of N-YHS's greatest treasures, the watercolors John J. Audubon had drawn for his <emph render="italic">Birds of America</emph>.</p><p>N-YHS's 2nd Avenue building allowed for free public access to the galleries, though as the collection grew through the 19th century the building became increasingly cluttered. But more important than the limited physical plant were the broader resource limitations, especially financial, which in turn led to limits on the ability to care for the collection. Into the early twentieth century, N-YHS operated with a very small staff of less than ten people, none of which were conservators or museum specialists. And as N-YHS began to plan for the installation of its museum collection in its new home on Central Park West in 1908, some members began to question the relevance to N-YHS of the non-United States historical objects. Indeed, the large Nineveh sculptures were left behind in the 2nd Avenue building, moved uptown only when the old building was sold in 1912. By 1916, criticism was being directed at N-YHS over the deterioration of the Egyptian artifacts, leading to the hiring of Caroline Ransom Williams and others to conserve and catalogue those objects.</p><p>The late 1930s were watershed years for the museum, as they were for N-YHS in general. The large bequest received from the Thompson family in the late 1930s allowed not only for the expansion of the Central Park West building and its gallery space, but the expansion of staff in support of the collections. In 1939, for the first time in its history, N-YHS put in place a professional museum staff, including a Curator of Paintings (Donald A. Shelley), a Museum Curator &amp; Registrar (H. Maxson Holloway), a Painting Restorer (Ingrid M. Held), and assistants. This new organizational structure is reflected in the archives: the bulk of the Museum Department records date from 1939 and later as these new professionals established their own files and records; earlier museum-related records were maintained in the central accession ledgers, correspondence, and other files maintained by the Librarian, who was N-YHS's executive leader to that time. Still, for most of the following decades, the Museum Department staff amounted to fewer than ten people, with only one curator, Richard J. Koke, in place from 1949 to 1969. In 1970, Mary C. Black, a folk arts authority, joined Koke in the department as Curator of Paintings, Sculpture and the Decorative Arts. About the same time, in August 1972, N-YHS received accreditation from the American Association of Museums (AAM).</p><p>The 1930s were important in other ways for the museum as well. Deaccessioning of out of scope objects came to the fore. When the Central Park West building closed in 1937 for renovations and expansion, the Egyptian collection was loaned to the Brooklyn Museum. It never returned as N-YHS eventually sold it and other artifacts to the Museum in the 1940s. An ancient medical papyrus was donated to the New York Academy of Medicine. By the 1940s, the possibility of disposing of some or all of the European artworks was being explored, which eventually occurred over time from the 1960s through the 1990s. The deaccessions of the 1990s, not only of European Old Masters but of silver and other objects as well, were highly controversial in part because they coincided with N-YHS's fiscal crisis of the time. The severity of N-YHS's financial problems led to the closing of the museum galleries in January 1993 and, a month later, its withdrawal from the AAM's accreditation program. Deaccessions of out of scope collections came to be recognized as a necessary part of any recovery so auctions moved forward in the mid-1990s within a rigorous formal approval structure within N-YHS and with oversight by the New York State Attorney General.</p><p>Through the mid and late twentieth century, N-YHS was also strengthening its collection with such iconic accessions as the folk art collection of Elie and Viola Nadelman (1937 purchase), sculpture groups by John Rogers (1936 purchase), and Tiffany lamps from Egon Neustadt (1984 bequest), among many others. These objects, along with those on loan from other institutions, were installed in hundreds of exhibitions across the last half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. More notable for an organization that seldom, if ever, loaned its objects during its first century, in the 1930s N-YHS began to lend its museum objects regularly to institutions in the United States and internationally. These loans included about one hundred of the Audubon drawings, which left N-YHS for the first time in the mid-1990s to travel to various U.S. museums.</p><p>The conservation, care and storage of the museum collection received expanded attention in the mid-1980s with the hiring of a full time conservator, Holly Hotchner. Additional staff was later added and conservation labs created, which continue to the present. Hotchner became Museum Director in 1989, and the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (commonly known as the Print Room) was transferred organizationally from the Library to the Museum, where it would remain until its return to the Library in 1998. Despite the many initiatives of the time, N-YHS's financial difficulties were too deep, leading to the loss of much of the staff and the closing of the galleries in 1993. Nonetheless, thanks in significant part to city and state funding, N-YHS's situation stabilized, key renovations and structural improvements were made to the building, and the galleries re-opened in May 1995 with the exhibition of N-YHS's collection highlights arranged to illustrate American history, <emph render="italic">Treasury of the Past</emph>. Major renovations continued in the 1990s culminating in 2000 with the opening of the Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture, which housed nearly 40,000 objects for public access. Behind the scenes, collections management moved into the twenty-first century with the implementation of a desktop computer application for object level control.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information Note</head>
<p>Various portions of records from the Museum Department were physically processed during the early 1990s to the early 2000s, mostly in terms of refoldering documents to archival folders. Related material was also gathered together in boxes, though some material remained in original storage boxes. In 2016, archivist Larry Weimer established an overarching arrangement for all the Museum Department records in the archive and, with archivist Margaret Kaczorowski and archival intern Katherine Palm, completed a baseline inventory and finding aid for the entire record group. Certain steps were taken with the material, including physical arrangement of folders and re-boxing, in order to facilitate its use by researchers, but an overall minimal level of physical processing was implemented. Consequently, much of the material remains in its original folders and unarranged within folders.</p><p>About 40 additional feet of material was transferred to the archives from the museum in 2017-2020; this was added to the finding aid in April-May 2021 by archivist Larry Weimer.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The Museum Department record group includes curatorial, collections management, exhibitions, administrative, and object files created by museum staff. The record group includes some important 19th and early-mid 20th century material but most of the documents date from the 1970s and into the early twenty-first century.</p><p>The most extensive portions of the record group concerns exhibitions, especially those from the 1980s to 2012. Although there is great inconsistency in the level of documentation across individual exhibitions, overall the files are rich with checklists, images, loan documentation, publicity material, research files, comment books, wall texts and labels, design elements, budgets and funding requests, and other like matter. In addition to exhibitions installed at N-YHS, the record group also includes files of outgoing loans to other institutions, such as the first ever traveling exhibition of the Audubon watercolors in the 1990s, and proposals and plans for exhibitions that did not go forward.</p><p>The record group includes some accession records. These are principally found in the collections management/registrar files for the 1940s-1960s, but 19th century acquisition documents for the Audubon watercolors and the Henry Abbott Egyptian collection are in the files, as selectively compiled correspondence. This correspondence also includes records of the transfer of the Abbott and certain other out of scope collections to the Brooklyn Museum in the 1940s. The record group holds object photograph files, primarily for paintings and drawings, and these hold a small number of accession and other documents as well.</p><p>The record group holds the files of three museum directors or curators of the late 20th century, including Mary C. Black (1970-1982), Holly Hotchner (1989-1994), Annette Blaugrund (1989-1995), and to a lesser extent, Jack Rutland (circa 1995-1999). These files, and other general museum files, largely concern exhibition planning, object surveys and inquiries, offers of purchases or donations, and the like. The curatorial staff's records and recommendations related to the Board Museum Committee are in this record group, though these are subject to restrictions; see the Access Restrictions note. The files also include administrative matters, such as budgets, grant proposals, staffing, etc. </p><p>In addition to the image files mentioned above, the record group holds other descriptive material for objects, including lantern slides of works by American and European artists, John Delafield's 1830 inventory of ancient coins and medals held by N-YHS, Leonidas Westervelt's inventory of his Jenny Lind Collection, and annotated manuscript versions of <emph render="italic">Catalogue of American Portraits in the New-York Historical Society</emph> (1974), <emph render="italic">Glass Paperweights of the New-York Historical Society</emph> (1974), and <emph render="italic">American Landscape and Genre Paintings in the New-York Historical Society</emph> (1982).</p>  </scopecontent>

The bulk of the files include documentation compiled from various sources within the Museum Department of specific exhibitions. Although the specific content varies widely by exhibition, documents can include checklists, images, loan documentation, publicity material, research files, comment books, wall texts and labels, design elements, budgets and funding requests, and other like matter. Not all exhibitions are represented in the series and some are very lightly documented. On the other hand, several are more extensively documented, such as the traveling exhibition of the Audubon watercolors in the 1990s. The bulk of the files relate to installed exhibitions, but some proposed exhibitions are also included, perhaps most notably the files for the planning of a 1990s exhibition concerning the Tenth Street Studio Building.</p><p>Files related to exhibitions were transferred to the archives over time by various members of the museum staff. Consequently, important exhibition files can be found in other Museum series, especially the Curatorial and the Collections Management series.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_c341502940fddf8bc42628090d2f4951"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The series is organized in the following subseries:</p><p>Subseries II.A.

The subseries includes only a few folders of material from before 1970. An increased number of files appear for the 1970s and early 1980s, and these appear to be largely from the files of the curator at that time, Mary Black. The bulk of the files date from after 1982 and seem to have come from various sources within the Museum Department (which included the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture collections in the 1990s), including curators, collections management/registrar, researchers, and others. In addition to installed exhibitions, the files also include some proposed exhibitions that never took place.</p><p>The type of documentation present for each exhibition is highly uneven, ranging from one folder with a document or two to extensive documentation of various aspects of an exhibition. Typical documentation found for many of the exhibitions includes checklists or other object lists, loan agreements and receipts, and publicity material. Other textual documents that can be found for many exhibitions are installation and design descriptions, wall and label text, conservation notes, budgets, grant or other funding proposals, correspondence/printed emails, and other planning documents. There are a few public comment books and the container list notes when these are in an exhibition's files. Some exhibitions include the sometimes extensive research files of the curator, public historian, or other exhibition developer. For traveling exhibitions, there is some documentation concerning arrangements and logistics.</p><p>In terms of images, there is a noticeable contrast between the files before and after circa 2003. Some exhibition files from the 1970s-1990s have object photographs and several have color slides of the installed galleries. The gallery slides are exceptional enough that an attempt was made by the archivist to identify them and note them in the container list. In the early 2000s, with the emergence of workplace digital technology, images become more common in the files. Many files from this later period have object lists with "thumbnail" sized color images. The press/publicity materials commonly include a professionally-produced CD with the paper material. Informally-created CDs from curators, researchers, conservators, and others are in the files, though not all are well-labeled as to content. Similarly, some of the later exhibitions have CDs of audio tours and other exhibition-related matter. Some of these CDs (and DVDs) are noted in the container list, but most are not because of their increasingly common presence (and often unclear content).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_9eae5626ffdcb1a6425a8a4b9f90cb7a"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The subseries is arranged in chronological order, based on the opening year of the exhibition. Generally only that year is shown in the container list although there are likely to be earlier or later documents in the file.</p><p>Note on labels: Many of the folders in the boxes are labeled with shorthand or working titles, not the full final exhibition title. Some of the folder labels in a set even refer to different titles, and planning documents commonly refer to various titles. The container list below attempts to smooth these differences by referring as often as possible to the full final name of the exhibition and by providing any alternative titles in a note. Nonetheless, researchers should be alert to the possibility of disconnects between the title as shown in the container list and the exhibition's actual title as they know it, as well as disconnects between the title in the container list and that on the physical folders.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_99362712f306793ce9d63eb4e69c757d"><head>Processing Information Note</head><p>Until 2016, the content of the subseries was held in various boxes that were generally well-arranged by exhibition within each box, but with no overarching organization or description across the whole. Across this fragmented whole, some files had been transferred to archival folders and received some processing, though most files remained in original files. In September 2016, archivists Margaret Kaczorowski and Larry Weimer compiled and organized the whole, and created the description for the subseries in this finding aid. Little additional physical processing was done so the bulk of the files remain in their original folders, though occasionally mixed with previously processed material.</p><p>7 additional boxes of exhibition files, from the late 1990s-2003 were transferred to the archives in 2018-19 and added to the finding aid in April 2021.</p></processinfo><accessrestrict id="aspace_8ff6791246a1b74573b8683c2dedb801"><head>Access Restrictions</head><p>Most or all of these files are expected to be stored off-site and so require advance notice in order to access them.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_ref1278_hq0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Former Governors and Mayors; 19th Century Hotels</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_2b1f4e75f2c807dea6dbbb0ca8fad3ad" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020579]" type="Offsite-Box">195</container><container parent="aspace_2b1f4e75f2c807dea6dbbb0ca8fad3ad" type="Folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f4ff52104c78683529b275cabfac58c0"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes summary description of two exhibitions, date unknown.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref1280_flh" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Scenes &amp; Events on Textiles</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1941</unitdate><container id="aspace_90f2214698ca94a3f6867a8b5b50ddcb" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020579]" type="Offsite-Box">195</container><container parent="aspace_90f2214698ca94a3f6867a8b5b50ddcb" type="Folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a84491ec8d1068619746328712768601"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes only a photocopy of the catalogue.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref1282_x0u" level="file"><did><unittitle>250th Anniversary of Trinity Church</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1947</unitdate><container id="aspace_e9c283922a212962089c7bc731837ba8" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020579]" type="Offsite-Box">195</container><container parent="aspace_e9c283922a212962089c7bc731837ba8" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2420_5wa" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Presentation Silver</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1947</unitdate><container id="aspace_ccdd87b57e39755682895034e4a739c3" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020579]" type="Offsite-Box">195</container><container parent="aspace_ccdd87b57e39755682895034e4a739c3" type="Folder">4</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9f18d466f9a1ba83f56973ac64b5bed5"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes curatorial object notes.

The exhibition venues were the National Gallery of Art, Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Detroit Institute of Arts, Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Fine Arts Houston, Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Seattle Art Museum, and the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco.</p><p>The subseries includes the early planning documents for the exhibition and the files related to specific venues, including contractual agreements, object lists, designs, labels, shipping, publicity, insurance, funding, and other matters. Correspondence with venues that did not show the exhibition are included. Although planning for the exhibition began about 1990, the subseries also includes inquiries and other Audubon-related matter back to 1984 that was filed with the exhibition records.

Rutland joined N-YHS in 1992 as Associate Registrar for Collections, later advancing to Director of Collections &amp; Exhibitions and, in September 1996, to Director of the Museum. Tamulonis joined N-YHS in late 1993 as Collections Management Assistant, later advancing to Registrar responsibilities as Rutland advanced. Rutland and Tamulonis left N-YHS in the late 1990s. The files principally concern the planning for various exhibitions in the mid-1990s, especially <emph render="italic">Treasury of the Past</emph> (1995), <emph render="italic">2 X Immortal: Elvis &amp; Marilyn</emph> (1995), <emph render="italic">Scaasi: The Joy of Dressing Up</emph> (1996), and <emph render="italic">Becoming Eleanor Roosevelt: The Early New York Years</emph> (1995). The Scaasi fashion exhibition files have detailed dressing records, control records, dismantling records, and color photographs of the exhibited fashions and mannequins, in addition to the usual exhibition documentation. Rutland's files also include proposed exhibitions, general museum matters (e.g., research requests, object donation offers) and administrative files (e.g., budgets).</p><p>See also the Subseries of General Exhibition files because those include additional folders for some of the exhibitions found here.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_a97015f1b68b7f82fd16a137eee0b306"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The files are arranged in two sets, with Rutland's files first, followed by those of Tamulonis.

Black (1970-1982), Holly Hotchner (1989-1994), and Annette Blaugrund (1989-1995). The series also holds records of the museum staff's recommendations to the Board Museum Collections Committee. In large part, the files include correspondence concerning proposed exhibitions, general exhibition scheduling, research inquiries, offers of objects for accession, object surveys, and other museum matters. Hotchner's files, especially, also include conservation and general administration matters. Although the bulk of the files date from the 1980s to 1990s, there is a set of files from as early as 1939, the point in time when N-YHS first began to expand and professionalize its museum staff. These early files include accession notes, loan records, and other museum matters.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_078c59af38f06f449544d8d5937f82f1"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The series is organized in the following subseries:</p><p>Subseries III.A.

Additional materials will likely accrue to the subseries over time. As of 2016, there are two "sets" of records in the subseries, designated in the container list simply as "Set A" and "Set B."</p><p>Set A includes files that combine both registrar and curatorial matters. The bulk of these files span 1939-1949, dating from the earliest days when N-YHS expanded its museum professional staff. The principal contributors to these files appear to be Carolyn Scoon (Registrar and later Assistant Curator, ranging from the 1940s to about 1966) and H. Maxson Holloway (Curator during part of the 1940s). The date range of the files extends to the 1960s so correspondence to Director R.W.G. Vail and others do appear, in addition to Scoon. The correspondence primarily concerns offers of objects accepted and declined, inquiries regarding objects, loans to and from N-YHS for exhibitions, photograph permissions, and other object-related matters. The subseries includes extensive information about accessions in the form of correspondence, accession receipts, lists, appraisals, and acknowledgements. Library accessions are reflected in these records to a significant degree as well as those of the museum. Donors/correspondents are noted in the container list below when they are represented in a file by substantive documentation or lengthy object lists.</p><p>Set B includes more recent (1993-2002) files of inquiries and declined accession offers.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_54797f5267d2719e4af2e6dcc2482eb5"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The subseries includes various sets of general files produced by the Museum Department over time and these are presented in roughly chronological order or in the order they were accessioned into the archives. The start of each discrete set is labeled in the container list as "Set A," "Set B," and so forth. The arrangement of each set varies, as follows:</p><p>Set A follows original order. This was alphabetical by correspondent, though some collection names, if different from the donor, were used to determine filing. Set A has a complete A-Z run that is followed by a second A-Z run. These have overlapping content and the second run simply appears to be additional related documents found at a later time.</p><p>Set B follows original order. This was chronological, with folders of correspondence for each month. At the end of the set are folders of declined offers, arranged alphabetically by the offering correspondent or object. Regardless of the fact that these particular files were segregated in the original files, correspondence concerning declined offers can also be found in the main run of Set B.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_3e3ff18576bb54f48295bab2347ccbf5"><head>Processing Information Note</head><p>The Set A documents were processed likely in the 1990s. Set B was processed by archivist Larry Weimer in 2016 to a minimal extent; those documents remain in their original folders.

Black was an authority on American folk art. Prior to joining N-YHS, she had been the Director of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York (1964-1970) and Director of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Collection at Williamsburg (late 1950s-1964). </p><p>Black's records primarily include two overlapping sets of files, one ordered by subject and the other ordered chronologically. The chronological files generally hold only correspondence and the topics include proposed and executed exhibitions, publication and other projects, research inquiries, professional exchanges, offers of objects for accession, and other museum professional matters. The subject files also hold correspondence concerning the same general and even particular matters, but also hold a broader range of documentation, such as photographs, research notes on artists and other topics, drafts of articles and other writings, etc. The container list includes a complete list of the subject files, using the original label headings. These first two sets were processed and described in 2016; in 2021, additional materials from Black's files were transferred to the archves and these were described broadlt at the box level and are found at the end of the container list.</p><p>It appears that many files related to specific exhibitions might have been removed from these records and boxed separately. For files of exhibitions during Black's tenure, at least many of which were surely from Black's office, see Series II. Exhibitions, Subseries A. General Files. </p><p>Although the bulk of the material dates from the years of Black's tenure at N-YHS, there is a set of 1940s correspondence between the United States Trust Company of New York and the Museum of the City of New York concerning the bequest of a Trumbull portrait to MCNY, subsequently renounced in favor of N-YHS (see the Trumbull subject file).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_aa0ca3ebb66cce02f20881f7443c2471"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The subseries opens with the alphabetically arranged subject files followed by the chronological correspondence files. The subseries concludes with descriptions of content of boxes added to the finding aid in 2021.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_68d1c6c118b60bba593067f3f3eaf53f"><head>Processing Information Note</head><p>Portions of the Mary Black files have been processed over time. It appears that many artist reference files, which are part of the subject files, were refoldered, likely in the 1990s. Minor processing appeared to have been done with other subject files. The chronological correspondence files were refoldered, likely in the early 2000s. In September 2016, archivist Larry Weimer made minor refinements in the arrangement, but principally focused on completing an inventory and description to integrate the files with the overall Museum Department record group. Little additional physical processing was done in 2016 so most of the subject files remain in their original folders.</p><p>Additional materials were transferred to the archives in 2018-19 and added to the finding aid in 2021 by Larry Weimer. These largely remain as received from the museum with no further processing.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_ref1349_8dp" level="file"><did><unittitle>A.

The mid-1980s to early 1990s were a turbulent time in N-YHS's history and Hotchner's scope of responsibility gradually expanded, formally and informally, over this period. By 1989, with the departure of museum curator Ella Foshay (1984-1989), Hotchner was promoted from Chief Conservator to Museum Director. At the same time, the Department of Prints, Photographs, and Architecture (the Print Room) was transferred from the Library to the Museum, where it would remain organizationally until 1998. The Security Department was also  transferred to Hotchner's leadership at this time. As Museum Director and a member of the senior management team in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hotchner was closely involved with N-YHS's facilities and fiscal planning, the effort to broaden the museum's professional staff, and the initiative to refine the institution's collections policy and the associated deaccessioning process. By mid-1993, at the height of N-YHS's fiscal crisis and as a result of large numbers of staff lay-offs, resignations, and other departures, only Hotchner remained as the senior level executive at N-YHS. Her role narrowed in early 1994 as N-YHS Co-Chair "Pug" Winokur took over responsibility for the Museum while Hotchner focused on the deaccessioning initiative of the time and the planning of certain major exhibitions. Later In 1994 Hotchner also left N-YHS.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_dd09a121905b4940c8ab045f995e1eb7"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>The subseries includes, at least primarily, the files of Holly Hotchner. (Some files of other museum personnel, including former curator Ella Foshay (1984-1989), were likely mixed in with these when stored.) These represent the range of Hotchner's activities from her early years in conservation to her later years as Museum Director. The files range from general conservation matters, storage and warehousing, object surveys and inventories, some exhibition and special event planning, and professional activities. Particular initiatives that are well-represented in the subseries include the licensing arrangements with Birchrun Mint to reproduce one of the Rogers groups, "Weighing the Baby", conservation of the Louis XVI chair, planning for new storage at Crozier Warehouse in 1990, and arrangements for the Thomas Cole: Landscape into History and Equitable Gallery exhibitions. There are many files related to outgoing loans, though these may simply be additional files that were inadvertently separated from the bulk of loan files found in Series IV. Collection Management Files. Fuller summaries of the content are provided in the container list below. Certain files related to Hotchner's activities as Museum Director during the 1990s are currently restricted. See the Access Restrictions note.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_fc9b9fe031a1ef5d24e2d0aadea69489"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The subseries is arranged by general subject categories. The categories were defined by the processing archivist in order to simplify and summarize the presentation of the many individual folders in the subseries. The archivist developed the categories based on observation of the relationship of groups of folders within the original storage boxes. Although the archivist did make some adjustments to their arrangement, in large part the folders found together remain that way.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_d110004a3d8847de602c014ad8cb18ea"><head>Access Restrictions</head><p>N-YHS restricts Board of Trustee and Executive Office files for 50 years following the departure of a President and Chief Executive Officer. This subseries includes some files related to Board and Board Committee matters, and those files are restricted accordingly. Specifically, the files date primarily from the administration of Barbara Knowles Debs and the interim leaders that followed her (1988-1994) and so they are restricted until 2044. While the restriction applies, those files may be used only by, or with the permission of, the President and Chief Executive Officer, the head of the Museum Department, or their designee.</p></accessrestrict><processinfo id="aspace_a50fd11f3bd993d90e31ad27eb43e377"><head>Processing Information Note</head><p>The subseries was processed in September 2016 by archivist Larry Weimer.

The files include correspondence concerning proposed exhibitions, research inquiries, offers of objects for accession, and other museum matters. The files also include object surveys, especially for sculpture, and general administration and exhibition planning documents. Fuller summaries of the content are provided in the container list below. Certain of Blaugrund's files are currently restricted. See the Access Restrictions note. A major initiative of Blaugrund's was the planning for an exhibition about the Tenth Street Studio Building. This subseries holds few or no files on the matter; the bulk of these were integrated at some point with other exhibition files. See Series II. Exhibitions, Subseries I.

The categories were defined by the processing archivist in order to simplify and summarize the presentation of the many individual folders in the subseries.

The date range for the series runs from 1975 to 2002.    </p><p>The types of materials contained in the files include:  internal and external correspondence such as memoranda and letters, facility reports, research material, loan agreements, receipts, insurance certificates, shipping invoices, and condition reports.  Additionally, some files include photographic prints, slides, transparencies, and negatives of requested items, requesting facilities, or of damage to requested items incurred in connection with loans.  Some files include exhibition checklists or catalogues. Files holding such images or print matter are noted in the container list below. </p><p>Together the materials document the considerations, process, and logistics underlying N-YHS's loan of particular objects, from initial request, review and recommendation by internal staff, final approval or rejection by the Board of Trustees, conservation work, insurance coverage, packing and shipment, and the resulting exhibitions and related publicity and press. More broadly, the files document the history of N-YHS's overall loan activities and the ways in which the collections have been called on in support of other institutions' exhibitions.  Loans for purposes other than museum exhibitions are also documented, including long-term loans for display in government buildings. </p><p>The subseries includes files not only for loan requests that were satisfied, but also for those requests that were declined, withdrawn, or otherwise unfulfilled.  Some rejections or rescissions of loan requests in 1988, 1993, and 1999 reflect loan moratoria due to larger  events in N-YHS's history, including inventorying of collections,  financial difficulties, and an anticipated move of collections related to the opening of the Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture, respectively. </p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_87ef0b2cb81b57fae3f623b76cdb71bb"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The Outgoing Loan Requests subseries is arranged chronologically by year of file.  Within each year's set of files, there are typically multiple types of files depending on the lending department, whether the request was fulfilled or not, and so forth.   When multiple file types were contained within a year, the files were arranged with those having a loan number appearing first.  These appear to be only museum objects and the number was likely assigned during input of object information to TMS, the Museum Department's inventory database.  These loan files are arranged sequentially, though there are gaps in the numbering.</p><p>Following the files with loan numbers are those with no assigned loan number.  These are arranged in the following order within a given year: long-term loans, museum loans, library loans, unfulfilled loans, loans of unknown resolution, and miscellaneous other types.  Not all types are present in every year.</p><p>Although documents were transferred to archival folders during processing, when the original folders contained significant writing or annotation, they were retained with the documents. Folder titles were devised by the processing archivist based on the original folder labels, handwritten annotations on the folders, or folder contents. For satisfied loan requests, the name of the borrowing institution is the principal element noted in the file label.  Files relating to loan requests that were denied or withdrawn were combined into "unfulfilled loan" files by year, with no further detail in the container list.</p><p>In some instances, the processing archivist found two or more folders relating to the same loan in the original files. These were likely the files of different museum staff (separate loan files maintained by the library staff are found with the library records) and so were generally merged, but materials were sleeved and original folders retained to indicate their separate origins.  Materials found subsequent to processing the core of records were added to the container list in their proper order, but were not physically integrated; these files were instead placed in separate boxes appearing at the end of the subseries.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_eedb8ce4e2c84b29ac9f4df121f7a53c"><head>Processing Information Note</head><p>The Outgoing Loans subseries was processed by archival intern Katherine Palm in Spring 2016.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_ref438_iif" level="file"><did><unittitle>Long-term loan (1975): The Hispanic Society of America</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1981, 1987</unitdate><container id="aspace_b51433aa9f4bc84d94e1a61ceaf46a1f" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020365]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ac54555209c2a58ec62d75e7577d6803"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Concerns a long-term loan of <emph render="italic">St. John the Baptist</emph> by Castillo y Saavedra  from 1975 to 1987.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref16_o8q" level="file"><did><unittitle>OLR-1976.2.

Most of the files appear to be those of Albina De Meio, who was Administrator for Exhibitions &amp; Registration from 1989-1994. The series also holds files from a few years preceding De Meio, and these are possibly from the files of Elizabeth (Betty) Romanella, the Chief Registrar and Registrar of Exhibitions at the time. The files include material on object inventories and storage, arrangements for off-site warehousing, custody receipts, general files on the exposure of collections when facilities were used for exhibitions and special events, including the use of part of the building by the Jewish Museum from 1991-1993.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_0e11c692abd9530e16ef7277f931313a"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The subseries is arranged by general subject categories. The categories were defined by the processing archivist in order to simplify and summarize the presentation of the many individual folders in the subseries. The archivist developed the categories based on observation of the relationship of groups of folders within the original storage boxes. Although the archivist did make some adjustments to their arrangement, in large part the folders found together remain that way.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_46ce9604ef4c7f3707b035e31d94d915"><head>Processing Information Note</head><p>The subseries was arranged and described by processing archivist Larry Weimer in September 2016.

The series retains the original folders, which include the object/accession number, the negative number of the object's image and, for some, other notes. For the bulk of the folders, the content includes only one or two black and white photographic prints. Many of the folders hold no documents, but those empty folders were also retained in the series.</p><p>In addition to photographs, a considerable number of folders also include other documents. These documents concern the object's acquisition, attributions, research notes on the object's subject, inquiries from outside N-YHS about the object, conservation/restoration reports, deaccession in some cases, and other matter. A small number of these additional documents are exceptional, such as the original 1765 declaration of John Cruger naming Joseph Drake a freeman and citizen of New York City (object 1957.64) and Frederic De Peyster's 1864 letter presenting the drawing by John J. Audubon of John Cleeves Symmes to N-YHS (object 1864.4). Also, some files include a negative or transparency (often color) of the object. During processing, the archivist attempted on a time limited best efforts basis to identify which files held documents other than black and white prints and these instances are noted in the container list below; researchers should not rely exclusively on these notes as other files may well hold useful documentation, such as descriptions written on the back of photographs.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_aa84154e6921e099faeb3c320fb9e0da"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The series follows the original order of the files, which includes three sets, each of which is in object number order. The first set includes objects related to boats or ships. The second set, which is the bulk of the series, includes objects other than boats or ships. The third set includes a small number of loaned objects.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_ff61085775335347869e14fef9773151"><head>Processing Information Note</head><p>The series was described and minimally processed in September 2016 by project archivists Margaret Kaczorowski and Larry Weimer.
