    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Robert Melvin "Bob" Adelman (1930-2016) was an American photographer known for his images of the Civil Rights Movement. A New York City native, Adelman was born in Brooklyn, raised in Queens, and attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. He graduated from Rutgers University in 1951 and received his M.A. in 1953 from Columbia. He volunteered as a photographer in the early 1960s for the Brooklyn chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), opening him to opportunities for documenting the Civil Rights Movement on both the local and national levels. Adelman's documentary interests ranged beyond civil rights of the 1960s to include race relations and social concerns more broadly, themes which are reflected in this collection. </p><p>(Sources for the above note include Adelman's <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/arts/design/bob-adelman-photographer-who-captured-the-emotion-of-the-civil-rights-movement-dies-at-85.html">obituary</extref> in the New York Times; his <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Adelman">Wikipedia</extref> entry; and the announcement that the <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-036/">Library of Congress</extref> had received a major donation of Adelman's work in 2017. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes about 540 black and white photographs taken by Bob Adelman. Most of the photographs depict 1970s urban street life in New York City, especially Harlem, the Bowery and 14th Street in Manhattan and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. There are many photographs that focus on particular themes within the urban setting, including the fallout from a New York City black-out, the proximity of black and white residents in Newark, NJ, and storefront destruction in Newark, NJ, resulting from the 1967 riots. African-Americans figure prominently in these photographs, though not exclusively.</p><p>About 50 of the photographs concern civil rights activism of the early 1960s. These photos range from nationally-recognized figures, especially Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr., to anonymous activists, and from events of national import, such as the 1963 March on Washington and protests in Selma and Birmingham, Alabama, to protests against discrimination in Brooklyn.  </p><p>Some of the photographs focus on particular individuals or personalities, including the television personality David Frost (1939-2013), the writer Michael Harrington (1928-1989), Brooklyn "Super Cops" Dave Greenberg and Bob Hantz, and various born again Christians.</p><p>Most of the photographs are undated and this is reflected in the container list. Many of the photographs have a copyright stamp with a date of 1978 or 1979, and this is included in the container list when it appears, but in some cases the photograph may have been taken earlier.</p><p>The number of photographs in a particular folder is noted in the container list in (parentheses).</p>  </scopecontent>
