    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Charles McKim (1847–1909), William Rutherford Mead (1846–1928), and Stanford White (1853–1906) established their partnership in New York City in 1879 and soon became the premier architectural firm in the United States.  Between 1879 and 1912, the firm received nearly 1000 commissions, designing a wide array of residential, institutional, commercial, and public buildings in New York and other cities.  Influenced by their extensive travels (and training) in Europe, the firm designed primarily in the Beaux Arts style, becoming the leading proponents of a return to classicism as an expression of American architectural character.  The firm's work at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, featuring the "White City," also helped to launch the "City Beautiful" movement.  </p><p>Among the firm's many notable buildings are Pennsylvania Station (1910, razed 1963), the Morgan Library and Museum (1903, expanded 1928), the Brooklyn Museum (1895), and the Municipal Building (1909-1915).</p><p>While associated primarily with the Gilded Age, the firm continued for more than three decades after the death of the last founding partner (Mead) in 1928, and trained many significant 20th century architects, including John Carrere and Thomas Hastings.</p>  </bioghist>

Accordingly, researchers should consult with the Print Room Librarian about how much time to budget when scheduling an appointment to view architectural drawings.
 
The majority of drawings are stored on rolls; unrolling and rerolling these drawings is a time consuming process, so only a limited number of rolls can be viewed per visit.   Multiple visits will be required for researchers wishing to view a significant number of drawings.  </p><p>To preserve drawings for future research, the following restrictions apply:<lb/></p><p>1. All research appointments must be scheduled in advance through the Print Room Librarian.<lb/></p><p>2. Researchers will be required to wash their hands at the institution prior to handling archival materials.<lb/>
 
3. Librarians will page only one tube or folder of architectural drawings at a time.   No additional materials will be paged until all previously accessed drawings have been re-rolled and/or re-housed.<lb/></p><p>4. No drawings will be paged after 2:00 PM (or within one hour of closing time).<lb/></p><p>5. The Librarian has the discretion to limit the number of rolls a researcher may view per visit.<lb/></p><p>6. Damaged or particularly fragile drawings may, in the Librarian's discretion, be handled only under the direct supervision of a librarian or withheld pending review by the chief conservator.</p></userestrict><c id="aspace_ref67_7m9" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries I.1: Rolled drawings</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3da9e232d44e1996e694175e0d80edd4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Included in this series are approximately 61,150 rolled drawings for over 1000 commissioned projects.

(This series does not include photo albums; see Series V for those, along with scrapbooks.)</p><p>All folders contain photographs unless otherwise specified. For projects that have multiple folders of material, general descriptions of what is in each folder have been given. Projects that merely have a listing of their name are represented by a folder of photographs only. </p><p>Sometimes images of other buildings may appear in a specific project's file. These were found with the other photographs in the file, and often cases have manuscript notations on them to "file in [project name]". They were most likely used as models for buildings, or contained elements or ideas that were to be incorporated into the project in question.</p><p>
Photographers included are Blackman Photo Service, Edwin J. Cardswell, Louis H. Dreyer, Gottscho-Schleisner, H. Ernest King, Schuyler Carteret Lee, J.C. Maugans, C. Ording, Richard Averill Smith, Adolph Studly, Tebbs Architectural Photos, Irving Underhill, United States Army Signal Corps, DeWitt Ward, and Wurts Bros.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_7e52313318440b7ce26104c25f971811"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The files of photographic prints and any related materials are housed and organized by size, and arranged in alphabetical order within each size. These are followed by a set of glass plate negatives. Because of this size-oriented arrangement, a particular subject can be found in more than one subseries.</p><p>Subseries IV.A.

Photos were housed and an inventory prepared at that time in a Word document. In April-May 2020, reference librarian Jill Reichenbach transcribed the inventory into N-YHS's collection management system and re-published the on-line finding aid to include the full subseries IV.A and IV.B list.</p><p>Subseries IV.C (large photographs) was processed and inventoried sometime after 2006, likely around 2009-12 when the bulk of the collection was processed. Subseries IV.D.
