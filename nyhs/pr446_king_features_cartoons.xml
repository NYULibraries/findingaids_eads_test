    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>King Features Syndicate was formed in 1915 by the publisher William Randolph Hearst, consolidating the various syndication enterprises that had formed within Hearst's newspaper businesses since they started syndication activities in 1895. The syndicate had its own staff of cartoonists, which created such characters as Popeye, featured in the "Thimble Theatre" strip. By the mid-1930s, the period represented in this collection, King Features was one of about 130 syndicates in the industry. King Features also distributed strips by cartoonists from outside the organization, including those of Walt Disney Enterprises, which is also represented in this collection. As of 2022, King Features Syndicates still exists, distributing content worldwide to over 5000 newspapers.</p><p>In 1936, some of King Features' newspaper comic strip proof sheets were exhibited at Ferargil Gallery in New York City. When the exhibition closed, the syndicate contacted N-YHS to ask if the library wanted some of the sheets for the collection. Librarian Alexander J. Wall accepted and a selection, made by King Features, was donated in April 1936. Wall asked that editorial cartoons also be donated and the twelve original such drawings in the collection were included in the gift. A few weeks later King Features sent along the Walt Disney-created sheets that are in the collection.</p><p>(The first paragraph of the above note is based on Wikipedia entries. The second paragraph is based on correspondence in N-YHS's institutional archives; see General Correspondence, RG-2, folder for letter Ki for years 1933-37.)</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The items in the collection were initially arranged, foldered, filed, and card cataloged in the mid to late twentieth century as part of the Caricatures and Cartoons Collection (PR 10). In June 2022, archivist Larry Weimer removed all the King Features drawings and comic proof sheets from the general Caricature Collection to catalog them as a separate collection, and to inventory them in this finding aid.</p>  </processinfo>

These were most likely to have been among those included in the exhibition at Ferargil Gallery in 1936 from which a selection of comics was made for N-YHS (see Historical Note). 31 of the sheets are for the Sunday comics, and so are larger in size for full page publication with more panels than the sheets for the daily papers, of which there are 15 horizontal sheets. The daily sheets each include only one day's strip, not multiple days. All are black and white line art, without color. </p><p>The container list includes all sheets/titles in the series. The cartoonist name is noted following the title in parentheses. Two entries have multiple titles separated with a slash (/); these indicate a mix of strips on the sheet (e.g., a mix of a horizontal strip and a single panel comic). Many of the strips are not titled within the strip itself, but a title and cartoonist name were noted on the reverse either by King Features or at N-YHS.
