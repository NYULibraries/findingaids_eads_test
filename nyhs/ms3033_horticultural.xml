    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The records of the Horticultural Society of New York (HSNY or Hort) extend from the organization's founding in 1900 through about 2010. They are preserved in various formats: manuscript and typed board meeting minutes, typescript financial statements, published periodicals, ephemera, posters, photographs, and a handful of artifacts (lapel pins, award plaques, etc.). They fall into nine categories partly imposed by the N-YHS archivists who processed the collection. Refer to the Arrangement Note following this one for an outline of how the records are divided and their respective date ranges. Fuller descriptions are provided in notes at each series and subseries level, but, briefly, the collection contains<lb/></p><p><emph render="bold">General Administration Files</emph>: Includes the minutes of the HSNY Board of Directors for 1900–2007, its financial statements for 1959–1974, financial reports for the International Flower Show for 1930–1942, and the working files from the HSNY executive director's and president's offices. Also here is documentation on the acquisition and subsequent sale of the collection of botanical books and illustrations bequeathed to HSNY by Kenneth K. Mackenzie in 1934.<lb/></p><p><emph render="bold">Library &amp; Archives Files</emph>: The Hort maintains an active research library today, and the material in the present collection documents its development and administration by way of accession registers, committee meeting minutes, and files on resources, funding, programming, and initiatives.<lb/></p><p><emph render="bold">Flower Show Records</emph>: Documentation of the flower shows sponsored by or organized by the HSNY between 1916 and 1998, the main ones being the International Flower Show, the Bryant Park Flower Show, and the New York Flower Show. Included are the myriad supporting periodicals for these events—programs, schedules of prizes, classes, and premiums—as well as photographs and a few scrapbooks spanning 1916–1998.<lb/></p><p><emph render="bold">Records from Other Horticultural Societies</emph>: From its earliest years the Hort worked closely with other plant and gardening associations. That likely explains how this material came to be part of the larger collection. Most of it pertains to the Brooklyn chapter of the National Plant, Flower, and Fruit Guild.<lb/></p><p><emph render="bold">Photographs</emph>: Images of the activities, places, people, and plants associated with the Hort in myriad formats: glass plate lantern slides, 35mm slides, transparencies, photographic prints (black-and-white and color), and negatives.<lb/></p><p><emph render="bold">Print Matter</emph>: Over its long existence the Hort has issued a broad range of publications in fulfillment of its mission to "diffuse information on all topics relating to the culture and care of plants." These include periodicals, yearbooks, bulletins, program calendars, and ephemera. The collection includes a small but interesting portion of early and mid-nineteenth century publications issued by other organizations that the HSNY kept for their focus on horticulture.<lb/></p><p><emph render="bold">Audiovisual</emph>: HSNY recorded its meetings, lectures, programs and flower shows audiocassettes, 16- and 35mm film, Betamax and VHS tapes. Many of the latter save television appearances by Hort representatives on programs such as Good Day New York and the Today Show. Note that N-YHS lacks playback equipment, so this material is restricted.<lb/></p><p><emph render="bold">Reference Files</emph>: These are ready-reference files kept by the HSNY for research purposes. They are split between personal names and topical subjects and include images, journal articles, news clippings, brochures, and biographical material.<lb/></p><p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph>: The collection includes a small number of artifacts, such as award ribbons and medals, lapel buttons and pins, and a few commemorative plaques bestowed on the HSNY for its horticultural contributions.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>New York City claims several horticultural "firsts." The first commercial nursery in America opened in what is now Flushing, Queens, in 1737. James Beekman built the country's first greenhouse on his Manhattan estate overlooking the East River in 1764. And in 1801 Dr. David Hosack opened his Elgin Botanic Garden—the first public botanical garden in the United States—on the site of Rockefeller Center. The first horticultural society in the nation, too, was formed in New York City in 1818. This early organization, the New York Horticultural Society, survived until the late nineteenth century. It should not be confused with the similarly-named <emph render="bold">Horticultural Society of New York</emph>, the subject of this finding aid and the source of the records described herein.<lb/></p><p>The Horticultural Society of New York (a.k.a. "HSNY" or "the Hort") was established in 1900 "to collect and diffuse information on all topics relating to the culture and care of plants, fruits, flowers, and vegetables, and by all possible means to stimulate the knowledge and love of horticulture" through monthly meetings, formal lectures, and seasonal flower shows. Among its founders was botanist and taxonomist Nathaniel Lord Britton (1859–1934), first director of the New York Botanical Garden. Early members included banker J. P. Morgan, stained-glass designer Louis C. Tiffany, and others whose wealth afforded the leisurely pursuit of horticulture on estates tended by (largely) English-trained gardeners.<lb/></p><p>In its early years the HSNY held meetings and shows at the American Institute of the City of New York. In 1906 it launched a quarterly journal to disseminate scientific abstracts and book reviews.<lb/></p><p>Beginning in 1910, the HSNY participated in and later sponsored the annual <emph render="bold">International Flower Show</emph> (IFS), a grand floral exhibition at Madison Square Garden, the Grand Central Palace, and ultimately, the New York Coliseum, that ran until 1970 (with the exception of two years during World War II).<lb/></p><p>The Hort also held large spring flower shows at the New York Botanical Garden and the American Museum of Natural History, and regular seasonal exhibitions in its headquarters. Prizes awarded for professional and amateur flower arrangements at each event inspired friendly competition as members sought to improve their growing and showing skills while learning from the experience of others.<lb/></p><p>For about a decade starting in the late 1960s the HSNY sponsored the <emph render="bold">Bryant Park Flower Show</emph>, the brainchild of longtime supporter Henrietta Sedgwick Lockwood. And in 1985 it began its signature <emph render="bold">New York Flower Show</emph>, which exhibited annually through 1996 (with the exception of 1994) on Hudson River piers.<lb/></p><p>The Society established its first office in 1920 in the Bankers Trust Building at 14 Wall Street, in quarters shared by the Garden Club of America. Membership swelled over the next thirty years, from 300 in 1920 to nearly 4,000 by 1950. To accommodate this increase the HSNY moved in 1948 to rooms in the Essex House at 160 Central Park South, where it stayed and exhibited until 1969. That year it relocated to 128 West 58th Street, a storefront space which provided additional room for staff, conferences, lectures, and shelving for the Hort's sizable library of botanical titles.<lb/></p><p>Along with regular lecture series and flower shows, the Hort's library has been one of its main attractions. Begun in 1924 as a working library for members (today it is open to the public, but only members have borrowing privileges), the collection grew rapidly, particularly through the generosity of collector Kenneth K. Mackenzie, whose 1934 bequest of 6,000 volumes included over 1,300 works by the great Swedish botanist and "father of modern taxonomy" Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778). Although these rare titles were eventually sold, the Hort's library today retains a respectable 12,000 volumes that draw gardeners, houseplant enthusiasts, artists, writers, designers, and students who use the collection to enhance their work.<lb/></p><p>Over time the Hort has extended its mission to reflect the interests of the day, as is clear from some of their varied educational and beautification programs past and present, among them<lb/></p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Apple Seed</emph>: An environmental and science education program for 3rd- to 6th-grade students. <lb/></p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Food for Life</emph>: Transformed abandoned lots into edible gardens.<lb/></p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Green Branches</emph>: A late 1990s program to plant gardens around public library branches. (A related <emph render="bold">Read &amp; Seed Program</emph> offered summer reading and gardening activities at the Green Branches libraries.) <lb/></p><p><emph render="boldunderline">GreenHouse</emph> (formerly GreenWorks): Horticultural therapy and vocational training for Rikers Island inmates.<lb/></p><p><emph render="boldunderline">GreenTeam</emph>: Transitional employment opportunities for at-risk youth and ex-offenders.<lb/></p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Neighborhood Plaza Program</emph>: Beautifies low-income communities across New York City.<lb/></p><p><emph render="boldunderline">NYDIGS</emph>: Affordable horticulture-based workshops, activities, and conferences.<lb/></p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Tree Corps and Community Gardening</emph>: Urban horticulture programs of the 1970s and 1980s. <lb/></p><p>In 2006 the Horticultural Society of New York moved to its current location, 148 West 37th Street, from where it continues "to sustain the vital connection between people and plants" through "social service and public programs [designed to] educate and inspire . . . a broad community that values horticulture for the many benefits it brings to our environment, our neighborhoods, and our lives."<lb/></p><p>[This note draws partly on an undated history of the Horticultural Society of New York found in <emph render="bold">Subseries II.D, Archives Files, Historical Timeline Notes</emph>, box 63, folders 1-4.

<p>The Horticultural Society of New York Records are divided into the series and subseries outlined below. Although the material appears to be strictly organized, the researcher should be aware that there are many points of overlap in the collection. For example, although most photographs will be found in the Photographs series, some photos can also be found to some degree in other parts of the collection. Similarly, although there is a Flower Show series, related material can be found in other series, such as ephemera and posters in Print Matter or in the administrative files.</p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Series I.

Mackenzie in 1934. Mackenzie's gift was particularly strong in the works of Swedish botanist and "father of modern taxonomy" Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778). That portion of the collection--known as the MacKenzie Linnaeana--was acquired by Kansas State University in 1966. The rest of the collection was sold in 1980.</p><p>Subseries I.E also includes HSNY guestbooks and visitor logs for exhibits and the library (1933-2010, with large gaps), and material relating to the proposed Lillian Gish Garden in Manhattan. The latter was the brainchild of landscape designer Luther Greene (1910-1987), who in 1980 received approval from Community Board 6 and the Art Commission of the City of New York to plant a garden--with Horticultural Society of New York assistance--honoring actress and longtime Sutton Place resident Lillian Gish (1893-1993) at the foot of East 56th Street. The site, on a platform over the FDR Drive, remained barren since its creation around 1943. Today it has been absorbed by Sutton Place Park.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_4dbd0ff04a686d746e3384c1d300fb88"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>This subseries is split into three groups: guestbooks/visitor logs; Mackenzie Collection; and Lillian Gish Garden.

Among the most important of these records are the Library's accession registers from 1926-1989 and the minutes of the Library Committee from 1936-1974, with related Committee files continuing to 1988. In addition there is a set of Library administration files dating primarily from the 1990s through early 2000s and that generally appear to be those of Librarian Katherine Powis. These administrative files also include some Library Committee and accession documents, as well as files on Library resources, funding, programs, and other matters. The series also includes files related to the Hort's initiative in the 1990s and 2000s to compile their historical records into an archive; these files include both working files about the archive itself and reference files with photocopies, and some originals, of historical documents.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref327_2bw" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries II.A.

Subsequent to 1974, the files are a mix of minutes and working files related to the meetings.

Some of these administrative files relate to the Library's Archives project (see Subseries II.D) and some concern general Hort administration, such as a copy of an employee handbook and membership lists.

The name Joan Nichols appears often in these files; Joan appears to have been the volunteer primarily responsible for implementing the archives initiative, under the direction of Librarian Katherine Powis. During processing of the collection at N-YHS in 2017, much of the original material compiled was sorted into various series (e.g., Flower Show, Print Matter, etc.). However, some material could not be readily sorted and so was kept together in this subseries. Consequently, the subseries includes a wide range of documents related to Hort's programs and administration. Most of the original material in the subseries dates from the 1980s-2000s, though there are a few earlier original pieces. Much of the subseries includes photocopies of historical documents (e.g., officer lists from annual reports of various years). The date range used in the container list refers to original documents, not the dates of photocopied material.</p><p>Several of the folders in the subseries with original documents relate to the Hort's public education programs of the 1980s-2000s. Among these were Greenworks (later, GreenHouse), which was vocational training for inmates at Rikers Island; Green Team, which trained at-risk youth in greening projects in public spaces; GreenBranches, which installed gardens around selected branch libraries; Apple Seed, which was an environmental and science education program for the third through sixth grades; and other urban horticulture, community gardening, and related educational programs. </p><p>The subseries also holds many files concerning administrative matters. Although much of this is photocopied material, there are several useful original documents, especially from the 1980s, including budget and financial statements, a long range plan, and the results of a member survey.</p><p>The latter part of the subseries includes many files related to the archives project itself. These include drafts and notes related to the development of a historical timeline for the Hort, as well as general notes concerning the project and the development of the archives. These files also include preliminary partial finding aids and inventories of records created during the project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_8eb772cdb6b604c27476317c38836ef9"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The subseries is roughly arranged by subject. Program-oriented files open the subseries, followed by files related to general publicity and then administration. The subseries closes with working files from the Hort's archives and historical research initiatives.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref408_91u" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pilgrimages/Tours (5 folders)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1930s-2000s</unitdate><container id="aspace_52c0a32c062a7f3a77164adddcbddfad" label="Mixed Materials [10170000019490]" type="Offsite-Box">59</container><container parent="aspace_52c0a32c062a7f3a77164adddcbddfad" type="Folder">11-15</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref409_gjr" level="file"><did><unittitle>History of Exhibits at Monthly Meetings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1944-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_76865e1143d343b9a804c4cadc225d20" label="Mixed Materials [10170000019490]" type="Offsite-Box">59</container><container parent="aspace_76865e1143d343b9a804c4cadc225d20" type="Folder">16</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d972ae32dc1e4c624dfbb769f4ccf836"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes lists of winners of awards for horticulture exhibits at the monthly meetings and at annual shows (e.g., narcissus, gladiolus).</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref411_r6y" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photograph "Method of Carrying Prize Stickers"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1935 November</unitdate><container id="aspace_1602306e12fa37de03163d609d52acb5" label="Mixed Materials [10170000019490]" type="Offsite-Box">59</container><container parent="aspace_1602306e12fa37de03163d609d52acb5" type="Folder">17</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref412_jna" level="file"><did><unittitle>Flower Shows (4 folders)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1980s-1990s</unitdate><container id="aspace_b0814691baae4d5b003cab9b738e38f8" label="Mixed Materials [10170000019490]" type="Offsite-Box">59</container><container parent="aspace_b0814691baae4d5b003cab9b738e38f8" type="Folder">18-21</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref413_7aw" level="file"><did><unittitle>Exhibitions (6 folders)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1999-2000s</unitdate><container id="aspace_f5d0f300c7aae4b67fe4609a21fd61e2" label="Mixed Materials [10170000019491]" type="Offsite-Box">60</container><container parent="aspace_f5d0f300c7aae4b67fe4609a21fd61e2" type="Folder">1-6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4439bc439df73cd1d2024b4c09a2d6ed"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes folders concerning Hort exhibitions (other than Flower Shows) primarily from the early 2000s.

These include the International Flower Show, the New York Flower Show, the Bryant Park Flower Show and the HSNY Flower Show. The records are arranged into three subseries based on format: Meeting Minutes &amp; Working Files; Print Matter and Ephemera; and Photographs and Scrapbooks. The subseries are arranged by event.</p><p>
<emph render="bold">Meeting Minutes and Working Files</emph> primarily includes the minutes of the meetings related to the planning of the International Flower Shows and the New York Flower Shows. For the years 1942 to 1970 these records include the Board of Directors meeting minutes for International Flower Show, Inc., the corporate body created to organize and run the shows over that period.

The majority of the material is from the National Plant, Flower and Fruit Guild and its various local branches, and includes records such as annual reports, legal and financial records, publications and correspondence. The records date from 1927 to 1980. It is not clear how these records came to be part of the HSNY's archive.</p><p>The NPFFG was founded in Montclair, New Jersey, in 1893 by Laura S. Stewart. The NPFFG's motto was "share your flowers" and its purpose was to get surplus garden flowers and fruits to people without access to gardens, especially those in hospitals, prisons and other institutions, as well as shut-ins at home. By the 1960s, there were local branches of the Guild across the United States. The records, though spotty, provide a good sense of the activities of the organization, and the letters of appreciation received testify to their impact.</p><p>Almost half of the records in this series are from the Brooklyn Plant Flower and Fruit Guild, which was founded in 1874 as the Brooklyn Flower and Fruit Charity, and joined the NPFFG as a local chapter in 1909. The Brooklyn chapter was dissolved in 1972, and records relating to the dissolution are included here.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_08a893ddca53a754db13c4c29b715b2d"><head>Arrangement

The subseries includes many images associated with international or domestic United States locations; while these images often emphasize plants they also include commercially-produced souvenir images of built structures and general tourist travel snapshots. While many of the images have some basic level of identification, most lack a more detailed context and few seem to relate to identifiable Horticultural Society activities (see subseries V.A. for those). Most of the images seem to date from the 1960s to early 1980s, but there are earlier and later views. The formats in the subseries include glass plate lantern slides (4-1/2" x 3-1/2"), 35mm slides, transparencies, photographic prints (mostly black and white), and negatives.</p><p>Although much of the subseries has a certain degree of randomness to it and ambiguity as to context, several portions are well-defined and substantive. These include a captioned photograph album of World War I scenes of troop movements and trench warfare with their related destruction of trees in France (1917); lantern slides of Mrs. Louis Levy's azalea and rock garden in Dobbs Ferry, NY; a photograph album documenting a trip to Japan (1967); sets of educational slides concerning sowing and repotting and turfgrass diseases; images by recognized photographers Ralph Bailey of <emph render="italic">House &amp; Garden</emph> and Bruce Cratsley; an organized set of slides depicting seasonal wildflowers; and two photograph albums of cacti cultivated by Richard Weiler.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_8e1bc8d9cf95fff62a56f12333df5551"><head>Processing Information Note</head><p>The subseries was processed primarily by archivist Larry Weimer.

Only a minimal level of processing was performed for much of the subseries; consequently, many of the 35 mm slides remain in their original containers.</p></processinfo><arrangement id="aspace_bade00b1ce00ce006436eab054bf3f48"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>There was no overall original order to the images in this subseries. They were compiled together and arranged by the processing archivist. Nonetheless, images found together in slide cases, sleeves, folders, etc., were kept together as found.

The materials span the Hort's founding in 1900 to the early twenty-first century. The periodicals range from 1900 to 1998 and include the various Year Books, Bulletins, News, and other regularly produced publications from the Hort. These are a rich source of information about Hort sponsored events and organizational matters, as well as information about Hort's primary subject focus: horticulture. The program calendars include more detailed information about sponsored lectures and educational programs. The ephemera includes a range of material concerning membership, Flower Shows, lectures and other events, pilgrimages/tours, and other subjects. Among the miscellaneous items are the constitution, by-laws, some addresses, and monthly reports of the New York Horticultural Society (not to be confused with the Hort), the first such organization in America, founded in New York City in 1818 and active through the end of the nineteenth century.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1159_3e4" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries VI.A.

The content and titles of these changed somewhat over time, but generally included information about organizational matters, such as upcoming events, and horticulture-related short articles and book reviews. Following is a general summary of the content of the titles in the subseries:</p><p><emph render="italic">Memoirs:</emph> Three volumes that include the papers read at conferences organized by Hort in 1902, 1907, and 1926.</p><p><emph render="italic">Journal:</emph> This ran from April 1906 to July 1924. It Includes annual reports, proceedings of Hort meetings, reports on the various flower exhibitions, library accessions, committee reports, and papers/lectures on horticultural matters. It was replaced by the <emph render="italic">Year Book</emph>. </p><p><emph render="italic">Year Book:</emph> Started in May 1925, replacing the <emph render="italic">Journal</emph>. It includes annual reports, lectures/papers, flower show reports, accessions, etc. For the first few <emph render="italic">Year Books</emph>, the period covered is roughly August to May of the following year. In 1927, publication shifted to a calendar year basis. These appear to have ended in 1940, though a <emph render="italic">Year Book</emph> was published in 1951 to commemorate the events of 1950, the Hort's 50th anniversary year.</p><p><emph render="italic">Monthly Bulletin</emph> / <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph>: The <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> appears to have started about January 1930. It started as a small pamphlet with short announcements concerning upcoming meetings and events/programs, new members, and accessions. By the early 1930s, it expanded to include lists of awards given for exhibits at the monthly meetings. By 1933, it further expanded to include transcripts or summaries of lectures. By 1934, a glossy version appeared, with increasing numbers of photographs. In Feb 1942, the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> started presenting annual reports for the prior year, fully replacing the <emph render="italic">Year Book</emph>. The <emph render="italic">Monthly Bulletin</emph> ended in 1947, going to quarterly in 1948. It ceased publication with the first quarter 1950. </p><p><emph render="italic">News:</emph> It started in January 1951, replacing the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph>. Slimmed down from the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> and much more casual, the <emph render="italic">News</emph> no longer included annual reports or articles, but focused on announcements, award winners, accessions, and basic membership information, though over time the content got more expansive. It was produced irregularly and ended in early 1957.</p><p><emph render="italic">Bulletin:</emph> Reintroducing the former title and replacing the <emph render="italic">News</emph>, the new <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> included both basic announcements and short articles, including book reviews. Starting in 1957, the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> continued until 1973, though by 1970 it had been scaled down in size and scope. An announcement-oriented <emph render="italic">Member Newsletter</emph> started in late 1969, overlapping with the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> through 1973. After 1973, the <emph render="italic">Member Newsletter</emph> (with the title shortened to just <emph render="italic">Newsletter</emph> in 1983) continued; the latest copy held by the subseries dates from 1998. The subseries holds a set of cards that represent an index to the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> for the years 1958-1962.</p><p><emph render="italic">Garden</emph> was a bi-monthly publication of The Garden Society, a division of the NY Botanical Garden. Subscriptions to <emph render="italic">Garden</emph> were a benefit of membership in one of the institutions comprising The Garden Society, of which Hort was one. The bulk of the magazine content was common to all institutions, but some front pages were content specific to Hort. The content was horticulture-related and was not concerned with Hort organizational and event matters.The subseries holds issues from 1977-1984 and 1986.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_0296bb9298672c40c496f68c840206ad"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The subseries is arranged by periodical title, advancing in roughly chronological order.</p><p>Items with the prefix "HSNY-" are freestanding, bound, multi-issue volumes.
