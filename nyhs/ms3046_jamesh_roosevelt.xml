    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes 15 volumes of financial records, including receipt books, daily transaction journals, and account records for individuals, businesses and securities holdings. Most of the records concern the revenue and expenses related to James H. Roosevelt's investment properties and mortgages, his personal and household expenses, and his transactions with family and others close to him. These date from 1830 to Roosevelt's death in 1863. Extensive transactions are recorded with his mother, Catharine, with Julia M. Boardman, and with a Maria Ann Kissam. One volume, dating from 1863-1866, is the receipt book for Roosevelt's estate, maintained by Julia Boardman, his executrix. The container list includes notes on the content of each volume.</p><p>In addition to the volumes concerning Roosevelt's own accounts, there are two volumes, and a portion of another, that include the records maintained by Roosevelt and Cornelius Bogert as trustees for the Leake &amp; Watts Orphan House and estate of Augustine H. Lawrence. These records date from 1843-1846 and appear to relate to a particular legal dispute between Augustine N. Lawrence and the Orphan House. There are also two volumes (1820-1840) related to the estate of Harry Peters, for which Roosevelt's father, James C. Roosevelt, was executor.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>James Henry Roosevelt (1800-1863) is perhaps best known as the individual who funded, by bequest, the founding of Roosevelt Hospital (as of 2015, known as Mt. Sinai West) in New York City. Roosevelt was the son of James Christopher Roosevelt (1770-1840) and Catherine Byvanck Roosevelt (1773-1854). He was born at his family's home on Warren Street in lower Manhattan on 10 November 1800. </p><p>Following his earlier education in neighborhood schools, Roosevelt enrolled in Columbia College, where his studies included law, and was graduated from there in 1819. He set up a law practice in New York City and was engaged to marry Julia M. Boardman. It was then that an unidentified, severe illness struck him, leaving him in frail health for the rest of his life. Although Roosevelt broke off his engagement with Boardman because of his condition, neither ever married and they remained lifelong friends; Boardman was named executrix of Roosevelt's will.</p><p>Because of his illness, Roosevelt did not practice law or pursue other business interests. Rather, he focused on managing the inheritance left by his father, building his financial resources through investments in real estate mortgages and other securities and collecting rents. His success at this resulted in a legacy of over one million dollars toward the founding of Roosevelt Hospital at his death in November 1863. Roosevelt's financial acumen was also put to use in another philanthropic cause during his lifetime; he was the Treasurer for the Leake and Watts Orphan House from 1840 until his death, replacing his father who had been the Treasurer from 1837 to 1840.</p><p>(The above note is based largely on <extref xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="http://www.roosevelthospitalnyc.org/uploadedFiles/Roosevelt_Hospital/Roosevelt_Content/About_Us/RooseveltHospitalTimeline.pdf">Roosevelt Hospital Historical Timeline</extref> and the <emph render="italic">Address by Thomas E.
