    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Barclay Mansion, one of several homes owned by the descendants of Col. Thomas Henry Barclay (1753–1830), British Consul-General at New York, stood in what is now Astoria Park, in Queens. It was built in 1849 (or earlier, according to some sources) by Henry Barclay (1794–1863), as one of a number of country estates that lined the East River. Henry's son, Henry Anthony Barclay (1844–1905), was a noted breeder of horses. His daughter, Gertrude Oldfield (Barclay) Ulman Kilbreth (1874–1961)—grandmother of the donor of the collection—was born in the house. It stood until 1914, when it was demolished for the construction of the Hell Gate Bridge.</p>  </bioghist>
