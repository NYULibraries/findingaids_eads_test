    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Lathrop Colgate Harper (1867-1950) and Mabel H. Urner Harper (1881-1957), a socially prominent couple of early twentieth-century New York, lived for years on Gramercy Park and served as benefactors for some of New York's finest institutions. Their domestic lives and European travels were immortalized in the pages of over one hundred newspapers in the United States, Canada and Great Britain through Mabel Urner's syndicated, semi-autobiographical column, <title type="simple" render="italic">The Married Life of Helen and Warren</title>.</p><p>Lathrop Colgate Harper was a successful rare book dealer, consultant to many major U.S. research libraries and authority on incunabula, Americana, and medieval manuscripts. A native New Yorker, Harper traced his lineage to several distinguished New York families. His grandfather, Samuel Barker Harper (b. 1777), married Christina Arcularius, daughter of New York Alderman and State Assemblyman Philip J. Arcularius. Harper's father, the tea merchant James Philip Harper, married Margaret Perego, daughter of a wealthy New York merchant whose family had settled in New Jersey by 1750. Harper was the great nephew of New York Mayor James Harper and second cousin of the Harper Brothers publishers. </p><p>In 1887 Harper joined his elder brother, Francis P. Harper, in the rare book business at 4 Barclay Street. The bookstore successively moved to 17 East 16th Street, 14 West 22nd Street, 437 Fifth Avenue and finally 8 West 40th Street. After his brother's early retirement in 1910, Harper developed his interest in Americana.. He became a much sought-after source of rare Americana after obtaining for William L. Clements the Americana library of Newbold Edgar, which would become the core collection for the William L. Clements Library at the University of Michigan. He was granted an honorary Master of Arts by the University of Michigan in 1928 in honor of his efforts in the library's development and subsequent growth. He was well known to many research libraries, serving on library committees for Harvard University, Princeton University, The New-York Historical Society and the Council of The Bibliographic Society of America, among others. In the 1920s, he developed an interest in incunabula (books printed before 1501) and went on to compile the first catalogue of incunabula published in the United States, A Selection of Incunabula Describing One Thousand Books Printed in the XVth Century (New York: 1930), once considered a basic reference resource.</p><p>In 1912, Indiana native Mabel Herbert Urner (1881-1957) married Lathrop C. Harper. She continued to use her maiden name in her professional life. She began a newspaper column in 1914,<title type="simple" render="italic"> The Married Life of Helen and Warren</title>, a fictional account that was based primarily on her life with Harper. The column was eventually syndicated in over 100 newspapers in the United States, Canada and Great Britain; it ran for thirty years, finally ceasing in 1944. The couple took yearly trips to Europe, during which Harper hunted for rare books and Urner combed markets for seventeenth and eighteenth century samplers, antique glassware, antique snuff tins, amber, furniture and other collectibles. Harper became known as a connoisseur and keen appraiser of rare books, and Urner developed collections to fill their Gramercy Park home that would eventually catch the eye of the national press and be bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art after her death. Her readers' queries about the couple's travels and interest in the cuisines of Europe eventually prompted Urner to write and self-publish a series of noncommercial but popular "Guidelets" on European travel and food, beginning in 1930.</p><p>In 1948, just two years before his death, Harper received an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from Brown University. The citation acclaimed his achievements and industry in helping to compile libraries across the nation, stating, "The shelves of the noblest libraries in this country reflect your zeal for letters and your discriminating love of books." He died in his office on August 11, 1950, his hand still holding the phone as he prepared to make his nightly call to his wife. Urner followed him in death on March 2, 1957, leaving behind thirty years of journalistic writing. Parts of the Harper estate were donated to New York area institutions including Princeton University, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and The New-York Historical Society.</p>  </bioghist>

The series contains some photographs from 1895, but most are undated. Files are arranged alphabetically by type of building. Included are several prints of the bookstore run by Lathrop C. Harper and his brother, Francis P. Harper, including one undated print by Long &amp; Heppner of Francis Harper in the interior of the store when it was located at 17 West 16th Street in New York City, one unattributed 7 x 10 ink drawing of the store's interior, and a few photographs of Lathrop's clerk and successor Douglas Parsonage. The Harper's residences at 36 Gramercy Park and 1 Lexington Avenue on Gramercy Park are captured in a series of photographs of both the interior and exterior, at least one of which was published in House Beautiful in March 1924. Included are several interior photographs, some taken by Mattie Edwards Hewitt, of the Harpers' home which document their collections of historic European samplers, antique furniture and family portraits. Also included with the residence photographs are two photographs of 193 10th Street, Lathrop Harper's parents' residence from 1854-59. The photographs of the fire at the store of Ira Perego, Harper's maternal grandfather, show New York City police and firemen at work in a smoke-filled street. The unidentified buildings are primarily residential, with one photograph of an unidentified Yacht Club included. Some related negatives can be found in Series IV. Oversize images are in Box 6.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref14_spp" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Bookstores of Lathrop and Francis Harper</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1895/1895" type="inclusive">1895, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_a14a5107160068e6089fe8f9ae447251" label="Mixed Materials [1804000004158]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_a14a5107160068e6089fe8f9ae447251" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref15_67w" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Residences of Lathrop and Mabel Urner Harper, some by Mattie Edwards Hewitt</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_39da17e38648bd708a799c72d2bb9998" label="Mixed Materials [1804000004158]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_39da17e38648bd708a799c72d2bb9998" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref16_rxo" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Store of Ira Perego, fire</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_69cb905d0d588f1a3bafbdadfb8a7811" label="Mixed Materials [1804000004158]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_69cb905d0d588f1a3bafbdadfb8a7811" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref17_b87" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Unidentified Buildings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_fc59757a535af2d909a8f3cef70c6a5f" label="Mixed Materials [1804000004158]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_fc59757a535af2d909a8f3cef70c6a5f" type="Folder">4</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref19_359" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series II: People</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_04fff61e358fbf8d449ea2ae50df2fca"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Series II consists mainly of portraits of the Harpers and their close relatives, dating from 1872-1954, with many undated photographic prints. Photographs are arranged alphabetically by sitter with unidentified individuals at the end. Thereunder photographs are arranged chronologically when dates are available and alphabetically by description when dates are unavailable. Highlights include publicity portraits of Mabel Herbert Urner Harper, notably those by Jessie Tarbox Beals. Many portraits of Mabel and Lathrop were taken in their victorian home or outdoors in Gramercy Park. The family portraits focus mainly on Lathrop Harper's siblings: Ella Adelaide Harper, an amateur writer; Christina A. Harper (whose sketches of her mother are included with her mother's portraits); Francis P. Harper, his business partner; and James P. Harper, Jr., a prominent diamond importer. One of the photographs of James P. Harper, Jr. was originally framed; the frame was separated from the photograph during processing and can be found in Box 5. There is one folder of group portraits of the family. Also well documented is Lathrop's mother, Margaret Perego Harper. There are a few photographs of other members of the Arcularius, Perego, and Dimmock families for whom the familial connection is unclear. Photographers represented in this series include Jessie Tarbox Beals, R.A. Lewis, C.D. Fredricks, R. Horton, Fabian Bachrach, Davis &amp; Sanford, Underwood &amp; Underwood and Hargrave &amp; Gubelman. Related negatives can be found in Series IV.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref20_v0n" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Arcularius, Andrew</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_aa0a72af870b39535e9a4916d522a164" label="Mixed Materials [1804000004158]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_aa0a72af870b39535e9a4916d522a164" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref21_png" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Budd, Emma Jourdan</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1907/1907" type="inclusive">1907, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_b6ef4f55c7b326d35d4a42ab0c74873a" label="Mixed Materials [1804000004158]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_b6ef4f55c7b326d35d4a42ab0c74873a" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref22_fw5" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Dimmock, Andrew and Selina Harper</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_6b36ffa854ba94555a63249bb35eb992" label="Mixed Materials [1804000004158]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_6b36ffa854ba94555a63249bb35eb992" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref23_wh5" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Harper Family, group portraits, some by R.A.
