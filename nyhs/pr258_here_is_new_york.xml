    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The here is new york photography project was founded in September 2001 as a response to the events of September 11 by writer Michael Shulan, photographer Gilles Peress, photographer Charles Traub, and photography curator and editor Alice Rose George. The founders planned to solicit photographs of September 11 from the public taken by both amateur and professional photographers, display the images, and sell prints for charitable purposes. Shulan's storefront property on Prince Street in Soho--empty at the time--would serve as gallery space. Traub was also chair of the Photography and Related Media Department MFA program at the School of Visual Arts and enlisted SVA students and faculty to assist with the project. The title from the project was inspired by the 1949 E.B. White essay "Here is New York:"</p><p><emph render="italic">"The city, for the first time in its long history, is destructible. A single flight of planes no bigger than a wedge of geese can quickly end this fantasy, burn the towers, crumble the bridges, turn the underground passages into lethal chambers, cremate the millions. The intimation of mortality is part of New York in the sound of jets overhead, in the black headline of the latest edition." </emph></p><p>The exhibition "here is new york: a democracy of photographs" opened on September 25 at 116 Prince Street. Submissions were accepted onsite during gallery hours; an effort was made to take at least one image from each photographer. Volunteers scanned each selected image (unless it was already in digital format), created corrected low (jpg) and high (tif) resolution digital versions, assigned image numbers, and returned the originals to the contributors. They then created prints (~11 x 17) using ink-jet printers, and displayed them in the gallery space-- the images were displayed without captions, anonymously, reflecting the project's subtitle, "a democracy of photographs." The prints were not framed; instead they were clipped to wires that were strung across the walls and ceiling. In early October, volunteers onsite began taking orders for prints, sold for $25 each, primarily to benefit the WTC Relief Fund of the Children's Aid Society. Donations were also made to firefighters' funds and the Soho Alliance during the course of the project. </p><p>Original plans called for a mid-October closing, but strong public interest prompted the project to continue. During October 2001, here is new york was reviewed in the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> and <emph render="italic">Village Voice</emph>, and received coverage on <emph render="italic">CNN</emph>, <emph render="italic">Newshour</emph>, <emph render="italic">Today Show</emph>, <emph render="italic">World News Tonight</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Dateline</emph>. The exhibition was extended twice, and expanded into an adjacent empty store space at 118 Prince Street mid-month. Here is new york was featured on <emph render="italic">Oprah</emph> in early November. </p><p>Here is new york continued to grow in the last months of 2001. In November, the organization was established as a nonprofit 501(c)(3). It received donations for equipment and infrastructure from the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation; in December, a benefit for here is new york was held at the Diane von Furstenberg studio, sponsored by <emph render="italic">The Week</emph> magazine. The Prince Street exhibit was extended to Christmas and two exhibitions of here is new york images were mounted in California. Former President Bill Clinton visited the Prince Street gallery on December 23. The gallery closed on Christmas Eve, but crowds continued to gather in front, and the exhibit reopened on January 2, 2002, with a reduced schedule. Here is new york also launched a website in December, opening an online gallery of its images at <extref xlink:href="http://www.hereisnewyork.org">hereisnewyork.org</extref>, and eventually taking orders for prints via the internet. </p><p>The bulk of here is new york staff served as volunteers. In 2002, money from grants and proceeds allowed the organization to pay some staff members on a monthly basis. Staff was organized into a number of departments that handled image selection and intake, the production of prints, print sales, exhibitions, public relations, website maintenance, and other tasks. </p><p>In 2002, here is new york continued to expand with exhibitions throughout the U.S. and abroad, including Chicago, Washington, D.C., Houston, Berlin, Dresden, Dublin, and Tokyo (see list of exhibits below). From February to June, the International Center of Photography and the Durst Organization provided here is new york with a new exhibition space at 1105 Sixth Avenue in New York (this exhibit was subtitled "history unframed"). The Prince Street gallery also remained open. While here is new york continued to display and sell images of 9/11 and its immediate aftermath, it no longer solicited photographs from that time period. Rather, it sought images of the effects of 9/11 and related issues, including the war in Afghanistan, other sites of terrorism, and world events. </p><p>In April of 2002, here is new york launched its oral history initiative, Voices of 9.11. Begun initially as a way for photographers to tell stories of their images, the project quickly expanded to include 9/11 survivors, family members, first responders, area residents, and others. A makeshift video booth was erected at here is new york's 1105 Sixth Avenue exhibition. The speaker controlled the recording; there were no time limits or restrictions on subject matter. When the Sixth Avenue location closed in June, the video booth was relocated to the Prince Street gallery. Later locations included Washington, D.C. (at the Corcoran Gallery exhibit), Shanksville, PA (the crash site of United Flight 93), Staten Island, and the Pentagon in January 2003. </p><p>Here is new york received the ICP/Getty Cornell Capa Award for distinguished achievement in photography in May of 2002. In 2002, the organization also received the Brendan Gill Prize, given by the Municipal Art Society of New York for innovative artistic contributions to the city, and the Charles Loring Brace Award from the Children's Aid Society for philanthropic leadership in the wake of September 11. </p><p>To commemorate the first anniversary of September 11, here is new york mounted exhibitions in several cities in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Its book <emph render="italic">here is new york: a democracy of photographs</emph>, which included 821 selected images, was published by the Swiss publisher Scalo. </p><p>In the months following the first anniversary, here is new york began to wind down operations. The Prince Street gallery closed on September 29. By December, here is new york had mostly ceased operations; a few staff members continued to maintain the website and prepare material for donation into 2003. </p><p>Approximately $875,000 was donated overall to the Children's Aid Society. Here is new york formally dissolved as a non-profit in November 2007. </p><p>Secondary sources that discuss here is new york include Geoff Dyer's <emph render="italic">The Ongoing Moment</emph>, David Friend's <emph render="italic">Watching the World Change: The Stories Behind the Images of 9/11</emph>, and Susan Sontag's <emph render="italic">Regarding the Pain of Others</emph>. </p><p>Main Exhibitions:</p>    <chronlist>

Here is new york scanned each image (unless it was already in digital format), created corrected low (jpg) and high (tif) resolution digital versions, assigned image numbers, and (in most cases) returned the originals to the contributors. They then created prints, which were displayed in the Soho location (and later in exhibitions throughout the U.S., Europe, and Japan) and sold for charity. The digital images (low-res jpgs) were put on a website in December 2001. Here is new york published a book of selected images in September 2002. </p><p>The bulk of the images are of New York City, especially of initial damage to the World Trade Center, the collapse of the towers, environmental damage and victims in lower Manhattan, Ground Zero, firefighters, police and rescue workers, missing persons fliers, memorials throughout the city, and the WTC before 9/11. There are also numerous images of the Pentagon and Washington, D.C. Also depicted are the Towers of Light in 2002, memorial services, the crash site of Flight 93 in Shanksville, PA, and reactions to 9/11 in various cities. In 2002, here is new york solicited images of the effects of 9/11 and related issues, including the war in Afghanistan, other sites of terrorism, and world events.</p><p>Professional photographers in this collection represent the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, the <emph render="italic">Washington Post</emph>, the <emph render="italic">New Yorker</emph>, Associated Press, Reuters, Magnum, Getty, Corbis, and other photo agencies. There are also images taken by freelance professional photographers. Here is new york did not distinguish between professionals and amateurs when selecting and inputting photographs. </p><p>A number of photographers participated in here is new york's Voices of 9.11 oral history project--see Series II for their testimonies. </p><p>Although this collection contains a number of well-known images of 9/11, it does not include some of the iconic photographs, such as three firefighters raising an American flag at Ground Zero or the image known as "the falling man." </p><p>The sets of prints in this series were displayed at the original Prince Street location and the Corcoran Gallery exhibition. The Corcoran set was partially composed of images that had been displayed in the Chicago exhibition earlier in 2002.</p><p>The numbering system that here is new york used has a number of gaps where no image was assigned, especially a large one from 3556 to 4999. Therefore, although there are 6,254 digital images in the collection, image numbers go up to 8860. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref17_ucv" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries I: Digital Images</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ccbfae6cc8b26e76806a5bbdced7d00a"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This subseries contains the low-resolution digital files created by here is new york from original submissions in various formats. Public access to these images is through a searchable database on the HINY computer terminal in the Library Reading Room. This database was created by N-YHS using here is new york's information and access points. The digital images can be searched or browsed by image number, contributor, or category. Categories were originally created and assigned to images by here is new york (note: not all images were assigned a category or categories). Some images also have information on original format and/or contextual information on the photograph provided by the photographer (or, in a few instances, presumably by here is new york). </p><p>There are 6,254 digital images in the database, submitted by over 2,600 contributors.

The Corcoran set was partially composed of images that had been displayed in the Chicago exhibition earlier in 2002. There is some duplication of images between and within the print sets. </p><p>The images were not framed for exhibition; instead they were clipped to wires that were strung across the walls and ceiling, with image numbers but without captions or photographer information. See the Hanging Instructions video in Production Dept. files and gallery images in Exhibition Documentation and Staff Photographs for a sense of how the prints were exhibited. The images were printed on Epson paper using Epson printers. The set used for the Corcoran exhibit was primarily created using pigmented inks and higher-quality paper ("Archival Matte Paper"). </p><p>There are 2,123 prints, arranged by exhibition location, image number, and release status. (When the collection was donated to N-YHS in 2004, all photographers were contacted and asked to sign an additional release. Printed images were then sorted by photographers who signed this release and those who did not respond.) See Printed Images Database for image numbers, photographers, and box location.</p><p>This subseries also contains the original image number tags used in the Prince Street exhibition. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref20_l1v" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Prince Street prints</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[2001-2002]</unitdate><container id="aspace_9106c1a10670e48dd6a833c0c2d315b4" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 - 13</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref21_4u8" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Corcoran prints</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[2002]</unitdate><container id="aspace_aff208701da1b7e1b7c2fdc20486dac2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">14 - 43</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref22_wk1" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Image number tags (Prince Street)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[2001-2002]</unitdate><container id="aspace_0a111b7b9e8ccc27338d3a9c433d3199" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">ART1</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref24_7j2" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries III: Unreturned Photographs</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9d22b27135f028e409811be59ae99b87"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This subseries contains original photographs submitted to here is new york that were not returned to contributing photographers.

and Contents note</head><p>In April of 2002, here is new york launched its oral history initiative, Voices of 9.11. Begun initially as a way for here is new york photographers to tell stories of their images, the project quickly expanded to include 9/11 survivors, family members, first responders, medical workers, area residents and workers, and others. A makeshift video booth was erected at here is new york's 1105 Sixth Avenue exhibition. The speaker controlled the recording; there were no time limits or restrictions on subject matter. When the Sixth Avenue location closed in June, the video booth was relocated to the Prince Street gallery. Later locations included Washington, D.C. (at the Corcoran Gallery exhibit), Shanksville, PA (the crash site of United flight 93), Staten Island, and the Pentagon in January 2003. Some of the testimonies were exhibited in the Prince Street gallery, the Corcoran, and the Pentagon.</p><p>There are 580 testimonies (some speakers recorded twice), which are not numbered consecutively. Videos are arranged by location of recording, then listed by file number and name of speaker. Files are in Quicktime format and vary in length. See the database on HINY computer terminal (and in finding aid binder) for a complete list of Voices of 9.11 participants, as well as information on recording location and participants' contributions to here is new york and roles in 9/11 (if any). The database was created by N-YHS using primarily information from a here is new york database. </p><p>Electronic records for Voices of 9.11 include stills of participants in video booths and office files. Added material includes technical and other information provided by Ruth Sergel, who administered the Voices program for here is new york.</p><p>See Series IV.
