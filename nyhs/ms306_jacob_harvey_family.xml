The bulk of the 19th century material consists of journals and correspondence belonging to Jacob Harvey, and is concerned with politics in the United States and Great Britain, the Society of Friends, Harvey's business affairs, and his humanitarian efforts. Correspondence and other materials belonging to Mary H., Mary, and Rebecca Harvey are primarily concerned with life and society in New York City and its environs.  Also included in the collection are typescripts, an index, and research notes prepared and compiled by historians Claire and Daniel Feins through the middle of the 20th century. Much of the 20th century material relates to the Harvey family, though a significant portion of the Feinses research notes are concerned with the life and work of prominent New York physician, and father to Mary H. Harvey, David Hosack.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>In 1939, Claire Feins, a graduate student in history at Columbia University, took an interest in prominent New York physician, botanist, and founding member of New-York Historical Society, David Hosack (1769-1835). Feins began to research his life and work while writing a history of Columbia University's Rockefeller Center property to satisfy her master's thesis. Following the completion of her degree, Feins continued to build upon her research, with the intent of using it as the subject for a doctoral thesis. In 1948 she applied for a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship to write a biography of David Hosack, but did not receive funding for her project, and never completed her dissertation. </p><p>Over the course of her research, Feins made contact with sisters Alice, Constance, and Georgina Biddle, descendants of David Hosack, who provided her with access to their family papers. At the time, these papers were thought to contain primary source material pertaining to the life of David Hosack, but Feins found little that was of any use to her. There was, however, a substantial amount of correspondence belonging to Hosack's immediate family, specifically his daughter, Mary Hosack Harvey (1800-1872), and her husband, Jacob Harvey (1797-1848). While Feins continued her Hosack research, her husband, Daniel Feins, who was inspired by the quality and extent the Harvey manuscripts, began to push for a publication based upon the Harvey material. </p><p>Although Claire Feins did not write her book on David Hosack, one was eventually written by Christine Chapman Robbins, and published by the American Philosophical Society [APS]. Feins appears to have lent some assistance to this work, and an inscribed copy, from Robbins to Feins, is in the collection. Preceding the publication of this volume, in 1962, the Feinses lent a portion of the Jacob Harvey correspondence and other materials to APS, which were microfilmed and returned to the Feinses. </p><p>Jacob Harvey was an Irish merchant, and Quaker, who emigrated to the United States in 1816, where he began his career as an apprentice to Abraham Bell, of A. Bell &amp; Co. in New York. In 1822, Bell took Harvey as partner in his firm, and Harvey became deeply involved in the commercial life of the city. 1827 saw his break with the Society of Friends, owing primarily to a controversy between the Orthodox in England and the New Lights in New York, as well as his romantic interest in women not of the same religious persuasion. In 1828 he married Mary Hosack who was the daughter of prominent New York physician David Hosack, and together they had two daughters, Mary Harvey (1831-1900) and Rebecca Harvey (1840-1912). </p><p>Throughout his life, Jacob Harvey was distinctly politically engaged, writing letters to such prominent figures as Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, John Randolph of Roanoke, William H. Seward, Martin van Buren, and Daniel Webster, among others. Harvey was acutely aware of the problems of his homeland and its people, and, with the aid of A. Bell &amp; Co., raised money and food for Irish relief during the famine, and assisted Irish immigrants in locating lost relatives and remitting hard earned money to Ireland. Harvey was also deeply concerned by the institution of slavery in the United States, and frequently advocated for the rights of enslaved persons.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The collection includes just under four linear feet of 19th century material, including correspondence, journals, and miscellaneous ephemera belonging to the Harvey family. The Harvey family papers are primarily concerned with life, society, and politics in the United States and Great Britain, the Society of Friends, and Jacob Harvey's business affairs and humanitarian efforts, as well as his political views and extensive travels. </p><p>Jacob Harvey engaged in brief correspondence with such prominent American politicians as Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and Martin van Buren, among others, but he maintained a robust correspondence with several influential figures in Great Britain. Of particular interest are his ample correspondence with George William Frederick Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle, T. Spring Rice, Baron Monteagle of Brandon, the Marquess of Lansdowne, and the Marquess of Sligo. </p><p>A significant portion of the collection consists of 20th century materials, including typescripts, an index, and research notes which were prepared and compiled by historians Claire and Daniel Feins. Although much of this material relates to the Harvey family papers, a significant portion of the Feinses research notes are concerned with the life and work of prominent 19th century physician, David Hosack.   </p>  </scopecontent>

Letters to and from his family, particularly his father, discuss commercial information, business conditions, local and national news, as well as English politics and Irish problems. Until roughly 1827, many of Harvey's letters are concerned with Quaker affairs in the United States, and the conflict between the the Orthodox Quakers of England, and the New Lights in New York. </p><p>In many of his letters Harvey examines the social, political, and literary scenes in the United States, and his correspondence is frequently engaged in a discussion of personal and public opinions on such subjects as the rights of Native Americans, the institution of slavery, universal suffrage, and democracy. Foreign affairs occupy much of Harvey's correspondence as well, and Irish immigration, especially in New York, comes under Harvey's scrutiny, as do the Maine and Oregon boundary disputes, and the Erie Canal.  
  
A number of notable correspondents appear in the subseries, including DeWitt Clinton, James Fenimore Cooper, Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, John Randolph of Roanoke, William H. Seward, Martin van Buren, and Daniel Webster. The container list identifies all correspondents, along with notable subjects at the folder level. The subject notes are not comprehensive as they are based in large part upon the Feins's summaries found in the collection. </p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_4c55a8fb9c722b372a65442337f966f8"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>Overall, the subseries is arranged by correspondent, with documents other than correspondence situated at the end of the subseries. The correspondence is further arranged as follows:<lb/>
 
Correspondence between Jacob Harvey and his family is situated at the beginning of the subseries, and is arranged chronologically. Following this, correspondents represented by several letters, or who are especially notable, are arranged alphabetically and foldered by the surname, whereas correspondents represented by three or fewer letters are foldered together. These are followed by letters to or from unidentified correspondents.</p><p>Some effort was made to maintain the order imposed by the Feinses, however, for the sake of continuity, this order was sometimes disrupted. Many folders include fragments of the Feins's envelopes that at one time housed the Harvey correspondence, as the Feinses often recorded notes about the contents. </p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref63_moq" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jacob Harvey to Family (Father)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1808-1815</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_5694ec9784222f4306fa0853f5e3f6e5" label="Text [10170000017499]" type="Offsite-Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_5694ec9784222f4306fa0853f5e3f6e5" type="Folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0c05f2f7ff50321a32b18963f3733969"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>These letters are unique from the rest of the correspondence between Harvey and his family in that Harvey wrote them as a child, while he was away from home, at school in Ballitore.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref56_yj9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jacob Harvey to Family (Mother &amp;

Harvey pays special attention to military structures and monuments, such as one erected on the site of the Burr-Hamilton Duel.

The initial entries are centered around excerpts from published works, most notably an 1817 Haitian Publication, titled <emph render="italic">Réflexions politiques sur quelques ouvrages et journaux francais concernant Hayti</emph>, which is concerned with the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution. Harvey also records notable cultural events, such as Charles Guille's jump from a hot air balloon in New York on 2 August 1819 and the Annual Culmination of the students of Columbia College. Other entries are concerned with government, on both a global and a local scale, and record such events as the Adams-Onis Treaty as well as the proceedings and scandal surrounding a few notable court-cases. The final entries, being compiled from Harvey's travel notes, most closely resemble his other journals.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref292_zv0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Notes on Trip to Washington, Mt.

The meeting addresses such topics as the rights of Native Americans and the descendants of Africans, with special attention to donations that were to be made in support of these groups. Other topics include Quaker affairs, such as member anxiety regarding the blending of Societies, Quaker presence in the press and the perceived public opinion of the Society, and how members ought to behave during meetings and in daily life. </p><p>Harvey's account of the Yearly Meeting in New York records many of the same topics, but reveals a more morally stringent attitude specific to the New York Society. Harvey records a number of discussions regarding member conduct, especially on the topic of member association with non-Quakers. Elias Hicks emerges as a figure vehemently against the cultivation of relationships outside the immediate community, and here Harvey asserts his personal opinion in opposition to Hicks, as well as that on a number of other topics. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref291_2sq" level="file"><did><unittitle>Account of the Yearly Meeting in Philadelphia/Account of the Yearly Meeting in New York (2 of 2)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1820</unitdate><container id="aspace_e3aa464b6ad1a3bf49cb426906dc57bf" label="Text [10170000017843]" type="Offsite-Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_e3aa464b6ad1a3bf49cb426906dc57bf" type="Folder">7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3cfe1bfa7af1f59f9f28171df7204d4a"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>There is a typescript associated with this journal.

The town of Troy, Indiana is the farthest point west reached by Harvey, and the reason for the trip appears to have been business to be conducted in this town.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref296_dgf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tour of the West (2 of 2)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1820</unitdate><container id="aspace_8627d3eb0d39e8403b43e23aabe178aa" label="Text [10170000017844]" type="Offsite-Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_8627d3eb0d39e8403b43e23aabe178aa" type="Folder">4</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_21382902ab1b839d9506761f85e36b9a"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>This journal appears to be a copy — or final draft — of the journal described above.

Letters from her family comprise the most significant portion of her correspondence, the bulk of which were written after the death of her husband in 1848. She received letters from her siblings Alexander, Emily, and Nathaniel Hosack, her daughters Mary and Rebecca Harvey, and her niece Emily Rodgers. She also received letters from her relatives Hannah Harvey Todhunter and Mary C. Harvey in Ireland. Of particular interest are nine folders of letters from her brother-in-law in Ireland, William Henry Harvey, who was a prominent botanist of the era. These letters span nearly twenty years and chronicle significant family events such as marriages, illnesses, and deaths, as well as parts of W.H. Harvey's career. The container list further identifies subjects at the folder level. </p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e38e9b793e4d0de53b7c48bdff8cf8d3"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>Overall, the subseries is arranged by correspondent, with documents other than correspondence situated at the end of the subseries.
