    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>An accumulation of personal and professional papers involving four related families on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley, this collection describes social life and customs as well as the structure and activities of several family businesses. Most of the items are dated between the 1830's and 1923 although there are some older legal documents (1761-1836) and a few items from mid and later twentieth century (1959, 1970, 1983).</p><p>The families represented in this collection were joined in 1903 with the marriage of Irmingarde Van Horne Freeman (granddaughter of Abner Van Horn) and George Williams Seaman (grandson of John Peter DeWindt and Caroline Amelia Smith).</p><p>Among the various items are personal correspondence among family members and with others; school documents and papers; military documents; legal documents including wills, patent documents; deeds, mortgages and leases; business correspondence, account books, receipts and other financial papers; photographs; newspaper clippings; essays and poetry; and many personal items such as the wedding book of Irmingarde and George Williams Seaman. Much of the material, especially that contained in the bound volumes, is related to business and finances, with the majority being Abner Van Horn's. The Seaman business material, however, is more descriptive of the history of the company (David Brown Company, George W. Seaman, Inc.). </p><p>The bound volumes are in relatively good condition although many of the covers are deteriorating and, in some of them, the ink has become faded. Several have been placed in boxes or enclosures. The correspondence and other papers are in good condition with some exceptions, noted in the Series Descriptions.</p>  </scopecontent>

Freeman, his wife, Ida Van Horn Freeman, and their daughters, Genevieve and Irmingarde, and is related to personal matters. Other correspondence is from Ida Van Horn Freeman's sisters and other family members including Abner Van Horn, Ida Freeman's father.</p><p>Henry Freeman wrote to his wife and daughters at home in Greenpoint, Long Island, while he was on business trips to Central America and California. After Henry's death in 1888, Ida returned to her family's home at Artist's Lake in Fishkill-on-Hudson (later renamed Beacon). A number of her letters were written to her daughters while they were away at school. Ida's sisters, Gertrude, Gay, Sadie and Alice also wrote to Genevieve and Irmingarde reporting Ida's failing health.</p><p>Irmingarde's correspondence begins when she was quite young and continues into the early years of her marriage, signed using various forms of her name and nicknames. Of interest is a letter written on the last night of the nineteenth century (January 31, 1899) to her sister, enclosing a pressed four-leaf clover (Box 1, Folder 6).</p><p>Also of particular note are Genevieve's letters to her father describing her intentions to become a doctor (Box 1, Folder 4, October 14, 1884) and Ida's letter to Henry showing her support for Grover Cleveland and describing an appearance in Brooklyn of Cleveland and George B. McClellan (Box 1, Folder 3, October 11, 1884).</p><p>Of the more than 107 letters and fragments, most are in good condition. A few are difficult to read because the ink has faded and some of the fragments (Box 1, Folder 10) are in poor condition.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref17_hny" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Letters Received, Abner Van Horn</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1836-1873, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_f1d1225c860bac8179c4601501ac27c6" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_f1d1225c860bac8179c4601501ac27c6" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref18_c0n" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Correspondence, Henry V.

Seaman and the majority of his correspondence is with Charles C. Peck, his business partner or agent. These letters deal primarily with business transactions. There are quite a number of condolence letters to John B. Seaman and his niece, Lizzie, on the death of his wife Amelia. There are other letters of a personal nature as well. </p><p>A number of family members moved to Texas and several of the letters are from Bonham County where John B. Seaman and C.C. Peck sold land to a Howard L. Parmele for the establishment of a settlement. Of interest is a letter from John Seaman's nephew, Seaman Field, describing the 'new city' of Dallas and commenting on his suspicion and dislike for members of the Parmele family (Box 2, Folder 2 - March 15, 1874).</p><p>Another letter of particular note was written to Emily Seaman on September 16, 1900, from "Lizzie" in Galveston, Texas (Box 2, Folder 4). The letter describes the devastating hurricane that killed thousands and destroyed much of the city. The letter is not in good condition, but it is legible.</p><p>In Box 2, Folder 6, there is what appears to be a copy of a letter sent on November 5, 1815, from John Adams, the former U.S. President, to John P. DeWindt congratulating him on the birth of a daughter. The daughter, Caroline, was born on Adams' birthday.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref30_96x" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Correspondence, George A.

The folders are arranged by type of document with the exception of Box 5, Folder 1. This folder holds two packets of various document types all involving Junius Judson, manufacturer of governors and valves, who supplied valves to Van Horn's business. The packets include correspondence, receipts, accounts, illustrations, etc. Folders 3 and 4 contain a large number of receipts and bills. Along with these are what appear to be worksheets on which bills were calculated. The items include Van Horn business purchases as well as customer accounts and bills. They are arranged chronologically, falling between 1864 and 1879 with the bulk dated 1870. In Folder 5 are bonds issued by the Mott Manufacturing Company along with a notice that the Mott Company is filing bankruptcy (both Van Horn and Henry Freeman are listed as creditors); a related letter written by Abner Van Horn; and a document transferring company stock to Van Horn. Items in Folder 7 include miscellaneous documents such as a survey report, insurance policy documents and cancelled checks.</p><p>Two folders contain Seaman Family items. Folder 8 contains an account book belonging to the George A. Seaman family. Among its entries are items purchased for his children, Emily, George and Charles (Carl). There are several of George Williams Seaman's receipts in Folder 9. The final folder (Folder 10) in this series is an account book fragment; the author is not identifiable. </p><p>The majority of volumes in this series are those of Abner Van Horn and Company. According to the 1870 New York City Directory, the company was located at 624 5th Street, between Avenue D and Lewis Street. Most of the volumes are account books or ledgers. Among them are a Workmen's Account Book and a Wage Book that identify hours worked and wages paid. It appears that Henry V. Freeman, Van Horn's son-in-law, was also an employee of the company. A Diary (1880-1884) belonging to Henry V. Freeman is of interest not only for its financial content but also the information printed in the volume (e.g., "Eclipses for 1880," "Church Days," postage and interest tables, "The Interest Laws of the United States" and "Population of States and Territories 1870"). </p><p>A volume labeled "Journal" is actually used as both an account book and a scrapbook. Belonging to Abner Van Horn, it contains transactions that occurred in 1836-1839 while he was doing business in Charleston, South Carolina, as well as business conducted in 1842 in New York. The rest of the volume is taken up with newspaper clippings on a variety of topics, one of which is Shakespeare, primarily the controversy over who actually wrote Shakespeare's plays, etc. There are also articles on Epictetus, Raphael, Rubens, Swedenborg, Prior and others, as well as an article by Henry Ward Beecher called "Cats, Dogs and Robins." </p><p>Two of the volumes belonged to Irmingarde Van Horne Freeman Seaman. One is an Account Book from her home furnishings and decorating business. The other, labeled "Bank Book," contains lists of layette items and their costs for two different years - 1904 and 1908. Her daughter, Sarah Corvinus, was born in 1904 and her son, Ogden Van Horne, in 1908.</p><p>While fewer in number than the Van Horn volumes, those of the Seaman family contain a mix of business papers that reveal a good deal about the David Brown Company, later George W. Seaman, Inc., a New York City-based import-export business dealing in wood and rubber. Much of the material is loosely contained within a large Ledger Book (1913-1923) and a Letterbook (1918-1923) of business correspondence, shipping documents, bills of lading and brochures. </p><p>Some of the volumes in this series are in good condition although others have begun to deteriorate, have faded ink, or have come unbound. The letterbook of business correspondence contains numerous items in poor condition.

Of particular note is the wedding book of George Williams Seaman and Irmingarde Van Horne Freeman Seaman in which many of the family members are mentioned (Box 6, Folder 6). The folder also contains wedding invitations and several associated photographs. A portion of the estate inventory of George and Irmingarde (Box 6, Folder 7) is annotated to indicate from whom items were inherited or purchased. </p><p>In Folder 8 are a number of items that are not clearly associated with a specific member of the Van Horn, Freeman, DeWindt or Seaman families. Items include letters; receipts; notes on scraps of paper; an advertisement for "Dr. Wistar's Balsom of Wild Cherry" (1844); extracts from a memorial for John Dubois (1869); pages from a notebook concerning medical expenses (1880-1881); a copy of a document promising freedom to two slaves if they obey their master for ten years (1805); and an undated sermon discussing Acts II Verse 23.</p><p>Three volumes are included in the series - a notebook that appears to have belonged to Ida Van Horn Freeman and two scrapbooks belonging to Caroline Elizabeth DeWindt Monell. One scrapbook contains miscellaneous clippings and personal writings and the other includes, primarily, clippings describing Newburgh's Centennial (1882) celebrating the 100th anniversary of the end of the American Revolution. Caroline Monell's second husband, Judge John J. Monell, was on the Centennial's Executive Committee and made a speech during the festivities. The scrapbook also contains a drawing and other items unrelated to the Centennial. The smaller two volumes are housed in boxes (*).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref109_d7f" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Nameplate Henry V.
