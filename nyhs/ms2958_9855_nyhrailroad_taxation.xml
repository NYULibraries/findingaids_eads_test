    <abstract id="aspace_877aa5c4ff9f5b8c4bd4e326800baf8a">The records include nine letters to Edward V. Loew, New York City Comptroller, concerning resolution of taxes owed the city by the New York and Harlem Railroad. The chain begins with a May 1886 letter from the railroad's attorney, Henry H. Anderson, proposing to pay a disputed tax levied on the Fourth Avenue Improvement and the tunnel between 34th and 42nd streets, but seeking to have the Comptroller waive several years of interest on the amount of the unpaid tax. Subsequent letters dating from July 1886 to the Comptroller from Emile Henry Lacombe, the city's Corporation Counsel, advise that the Comptroller has the authority to accept the railroad's proposal, and October 1886 letters make clear that the offer was accepted and the taxes paid from both the New York &amp; Harlem and the New York Central &amp; Hudson River railroad companies. A further letter from Anderson argues, and Lacombe accepts the company's position, that certain taxes on the horse railroad of the New York &amp; Harlem Railroad are also resolved by this settlement. The records include a spreadsheet of the relevant horse railroad taxes, which date from 1880.<lb/> <lb/>
