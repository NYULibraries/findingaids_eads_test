    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The house at 19 Gramercy Park South (originally known by the address 86 Irving Place) was built in 1845 by Whig politician William Samuel Johnson. In 1887 the house, then owned by Stuyvesant Fish (1851-1923), the president of the Illinois Central Railroad, was altered and expanded by the architect Stanford White. Among White's luxurious additions was a ballroom on the top floor, where Fish's wife, Mamie (1853-1915), hosted elaborate parties for New York's elite. By the turn of the 20th century, when the Fishes had moved uptown to a new house, the Gramercy Park building was cut up into apartments. Publicist Benjamin Sonnenberg (1901-1978) and his wife, Hilda (1902-1979), rented the first two floors in 1931. In 1945 they bought the entire five-story house from Stuyvesant Fish Jr., and combined it with an adjoining apartment building, thereby creating a lavish thirty-seven room mansion which the writer Brendan Gill called "the greatest private house left in New York."</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This album contains color photographs of various rooms in the Sonnenberg Mansion at 19 Gramercy Park South, as it was furnished with the opulent collections of china, glass, silver, brass, antiques, and drawings acquired during the occupancy of publicist Benjamin Sonnenberg (1901-1978) and his wife, Hilda (1902-1979). By the terms of Mr. Sonnenberg's will, at his death the house was put up for sale, and the contents auctioned, both of which happened in 1979. It is likely that Steven Tucker, a grandson of the Sonnenbergs and the photographer of these images, took them around 1978, and that he did so at the request of television personality Alistair Cooke (1908-2004), who was a close friend of the Sonnenbergs. Cooke (or, perhaps, Tucker) placed the photographs inside their green morocco album stamped on the cover "NO. 19," for 19 Gramercy Park South. A bookplate identifies the album as having come from the library of Alistair Cooke. [For more on the house, its owners, and their treasures, see Paul Goldberger, "First Visit to a Grand New York House," New York Times, December 21, 1978.]</p>  </scopecontent>
