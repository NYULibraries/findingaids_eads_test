    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection is arranged into 53 series in the alphabetical order of the Naval History Society's individual named collections, followed by three series of logbooks, a Miscellaneous Manuscripts collection, and the Society's records series.</p><p>In some cases the inclusion of materials in a series seems fairly arbitrary. For example, John Sanford Barnes's materials on John Barry and John Paul Jones appear both in those named series (Series 5, Series 28) and in the appropriate folders of the Miscellaneous Manuscripts collection (Series 52). The final series is the records of the Society itself, documenting all of its routine activities including the editing and publishing of some of the manuscript collections; it is organized into seven subseries.</p><p>The Barnes family materials have been organized into three individual series: General James Barnes, John Sanford Barnes, Colonel James Barnes (Series 2-4). The logbooks have also been organized into three separate series: US Navy, British Navy, and commercial vessels (Series 49-51). Larger collections of mixed papers and published materials, including those of Gustavus Vasa Fox (Series 17) and Caspar Goodrich (Series 21), have been organized into subseries. Original order within folders has been retained; some materials are now housed in separate oversized (OS) boxes, noted in the container lists.</p><p>The series are:</p><p>Series 1.

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Collection consists of 53 individual collections, many named for renowned naval officers or vessels. These include correspondence, letter books, journals and diaries, lectures, essays, account books, biographical writings, genealogical information, scrapbooks, orders, notes, articles and clippings, photographs, manuscripts, and ships' logs, as well as the organizational records and correspondence of the Naval History Society itself.</p><p>The majority of the collections document American naval engagements and commercial maritime pursuits, personalities, and vessels; a few collections of British and French documents are included (Series 18, 22, 39, 50). The Collection as a whole provides primary sources on American naval involvement in hostilities from the Revolution (1775-1783) to the Spanish American War (1898), as well as routine commercial and naval shipboard life, naval design, navigation, education and officer training. The Society's records (Series 53) document the founding, management, and activities of a collecting and publishing organization in the first third of the 20th century.</p><p>As well as documenting individual events and personalities, the Collection is a richly detailed example of late 19th and early 20th century subject-specific collecting activity and interests. Many of the collections are so-called artificial collections, with items specifically accumulated and grouped together to document a particular subject or person, and showing the personality and interests of the collector through the materials' organization and editing.</p><p>The Collection reflects most strongly the personal interest of John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3), founding President of the Naval History Society in 1909 and a collector of books, manuscripts, and memorabilia connected to naval history and personalities. His son, Col. James Barnes (see Series 4), donated Barnes's collections to the Naval History Society in 1915. The library was cataloged under the XN call number and the artifacts included in the museum collections of New-York Historical Society after it absorbed the Naval History Society's collections in 1925 (see Series 53 for a complete chronology).</p><p>Other materials were subsequently donated to or purchased by the Naval History Society in fulfillment of its mission of "publishing and preserving manuscripts, documents, and writings relating to our naval history, naval art and science, and the surroundings and experiences of seamen in general and of American seamen in particular." Some of the manuscript collections were edited and published by the Naval History Society for distribution to its members (see Series 53, subseries VI, for a complete list). The John Barry (Series 5), James Fenimore Cooper (Series 11), John Paul Jones (Series 28), Officers' autograph letters signed (Series 44), and Miscellaneous Manuscripts (Series 52) collections document the emphasis on autograph and highpoint collecting typical of his time, which were particular interests of John Sanford Barnes. </p><p>The collections vary in size and complexity, from one volume to an individual's lifetime of personal and family papers. Although amassed separately, because of their shared focus the constituent collections are interrelated in illuminating ways: Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox (Series 17) is strongly represented in <title render="italic">Monitor</title> designer John Ericsson's (Series 16) correspondence received (and vice versa), while the USS <title render="italic">Dictator</title> (Series 13) collection provides a photograph of an ironclad of the Monitor class; Charles Biddle's (Series 6) early documentation of Panama prefigures the extensive and routine ocean traffic of the Gold Rush period (Series 43); Theodore P. Greene (Series 24) commanded a vessel on which Richard Worsam Meade 3rd (Series 31) served; the collections containing material on Isaac Hull and William Bainbridge (Series 1, Series 27, Series 52) provide complementary documentation of the naval engagements of the War of 1812; while the commercial logbooks in both Series 43 and 51 document some of the same routes.</p><p>Although focused on naval history, the Collection is by no means exhaustive or complete. Barnes's personal interest; collections put on the market by individuals, dealers, and auction houses; and changing levels of interest in collections of both notable individuals and those lesser known all contributed to the availability of materials and their eventual inclusion in (or absence from) the Collection.</p>  </scopecontent>

James Fenimore Cooper's biography was printed in his "Lives of distinguished American naval officers" in 1846, and in <title render="italic">Graham's Magazine</title>, in November, 1892. The Dearborn manuscript was the basis for James Barnes's edited version, "The life of William Bainbridge, esq. of the United States Navy, by H. A. S. Dearborn, 1816," published by Princeton University Press in 1931, and distributed to members of the Naval History Society in 1932. </p><p>The Cooper manuscript is available on microfilm.</p><p><emph render="bold">Biographical Note</emph></p><p>Born in 1774, Bainbridge commanded ships in the West Indies, capturing French privateers, and against the Barbary Powers in the Mediterranean. While commanding the 44-gun frigate <title render="italic">Philadelphia</title>, the ship foundered and he was captured and imprisoned in Tripoli for 19 months. After his release in 1805, Bainbridge made various naval and merchant marine voyages to India and Russia, returning to the United States as hostilities increased with England. As commander of <title render="italic">Constitution</title>, he captured the British frigate <title render="italic">Java</title> on December 29, 1812, during which engagement he was wounded twice. He subsequently had various commands and shore assignments and served as Naval Commissioner from 1824-1827 and from 1829-1831. His command of the Charlestown Navy Yard was curtailed by illness in November, 1832. He died in Philadelphia in 1833 and is buried in Christ Church there.</p><p>John Sanford Barnes was Bainbridge's grandson-in-law: his wife, Susan Bainbridge Hayes, was the daughter of Commodore Bainbridge's daughter, Sarah Bainbridge Hayes.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref13_w91" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Manuscripts related to American 44-gun frigates</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1815 (?), 1907</unitdate><container id="aspace_602a4391f34f9ddd9b4866c0672eab51" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_602a4391f34f9ddd9b4866c0672eab51" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref14_8tf" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Notebooks related to American 44-gun frigates</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_67848986e8827058b0ae074759e4d6bd" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_67848986e8827058b0ae074759e4d6bd" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref15_sne" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>The Life of William Bainbridge, Esq., United States Navy; manuscript by Henry A.S.

The genealogy includes mention of a Sanford relative, Henrietta Emmerson, who was the owner of Dred Scott, the decision in whose case determined that African-Americans were not citizens and which negated the Missouri Compromise. Because Emmerson was a minor at the time, Scott's suit in 1857 was brought against her uncle, John Francis Alexander Sanford.</p><p>The 1908 printed Foreword to a collection of Barnes's letters to his wife includes details of his life and naval service; the letter collection is not included in the series.</p><p> Barnes's father General James Barnes's commissions are signed by Presidents Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson, and Abraham Lincoln; his own by Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan; his father-in-law Thomas Hayes's by William Henry Harrison; and his uncle Henry Bainbridge's by James Monroe, James Polk, Andrew Jackson, and Millard Fillmore. His autobiography is handwritten and was privately produced; it is inscribed from Mrs. John Sanford Barnes to the Barnes's daughter Charlotte Adams Barnes (Mrs. Edward Shelton Martin), who presented it to the New-York Historical Society in 1961.</p><p>Portions of this collection relating to the Civil War have been digitized and are available to on-site researchers and to users affiliated with subscribing institutions via <extref xlink:href="http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/results?sid=100edece-435b-44c9-8d77-a6a870454678%40sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4104&amp;bquery=%28HJ+FBIY%29+OR+%28HJ+FBIZ%29&amp;bdata=JmRiPWg1YyZ0eXBlPTEmc2l0ZT1laG9zdC1saXZl">EBSCOhost</extref>.</p><p><emph render="bold">Biographical Note</emph></p><p>The son of General James Barnes (see Series 2), John S. Barnes was born at West Point, NY, in 1836. He entered the Naval Academy at Annapolis at age 14, serving after his graduation on <title render="italic">Preble</title>, and under Commodore Stewart on <title render="italic">San Jacinto</title> in Europe and the West Indies, and on <title render="italic">Saratoga</title>. He was aboard <title render="italic">Arctic</title> when it participated in the first survey for the original Atlantic cable in 1856. The following year, aged 21, he was appointed assistant professor of ethics at the Naval Academy, and after a subsequent year in private business he was appointed master of <title render="italic">Jamestown</title>. In 1858 he resigned his commission and attended law school in Albany, New York, practicing until 1861. During the Civil War, he served initially as navigator of <title render="italic">Wabash</title>, and later as commander of <title render="italic">Dawn</title>, <title render="italic">Paul Jones</title>, <title render="italic">Lenape</title>, and <title render="italic">Bat</title>. In 1863 he married Susan Bainbridge Hayes, granddaughter of Commodore William Bainbridge (see Series 1) and great-grandniece of Admiral John Barry (see Series 5). After the War, he served as commander of the Naval Academy's practice ships <title render="italic">Marblehead</title> and <title render="italic">Savannah</title>, as an instructor at the Academy, and wrote "Submarine Warfare": the first major work on the use of torpedoes.</p><p>From 1869 to 1880 he was in private business and began devoting time to collecting memorabilia of the Navy during the Revolution and War of 1812. He served as the first President of the Naval History Society and edited the first volume of its publications, "The Log Books of the <title render="italic">Serapis</title>, <title render="italic">Alliance</title>, and <title render="italic">Ariel</title>," before his death in 1911. His manuscript collections and library formed the basis of the Naval History Society's collections, and were donated to the Society in 1915, by his son Col. James Barnes (see Series 4).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref36_592" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Naval tactics as used in boatsailing, under Capt.

It is accompanied by original and carbon typescripts of Barnes's lists of the extra illustrations, a manuscript notebook index of the additions, and a folder of photoreproductions.</p><p>Among the autographed letters included are those of John Barry (see Series 5), Cooper himself, John Hancock, Commodore Bainbridge (Series 1), Isaac Hull (Series 27), David Porter, and Commodore Perry (Series 36), all of whom are represented elsewhere in the Naval History Society Collection. The illustrations document all the major naval battles, ships, and persons mentioned in Cooper's work.</p><p><emph render="bold">Historical Note</emph></p><p>The practice of adding printed, manuscript, and visual materials as well as associated ephemera to previously published volumes probably began with James Granger's 1769 publication of "Biographical History of England," in which leaves were left blank specifically for the insertion of portraits by the purchaser. So-called extra-illustration reached its peak in the late 19th century as an organizational and collecting paradigm. An extra-illustrated volume very much reflects the collector and his or her interests, serving as a repository in the form of a cabinet of curiosities in which to display a wide range of associated, however remote, materials. Contemporary descriptions of extra-illustrated volumes often stress the volume of materials added as well as their quality, a significant expansion of the original being a virtue. Cooper's "History" provides a perfect setting for the physical manifestation of Barnes's lifelong interest in naval history and memorabilia, citing as it does every major naval engagement and personality. This work, when considered together with the Miscellaneous Manuscripts (Series 52), US Navy: Officer's autograph letters (Series 44), and John Paul Jones collections (Series 28), provides material evidence of Barnes's passion for collecting and its meticulous documentation. </p><p><emph render="bold">Related Material at The New-York Historical Society</emph></p><p>A bound version of the handwritten illustration list (originally from the Naval History Society Collection) titled "Catalogue of the extra illustrations, print, and manuscripts added by Captain James Sanford Barnes, U.S.N., to James Fenimore Cooper's History of the Navy of the United States, extending it to eight volumes" is available in the Reading Room.

Taylor, and a few autograph) as well as telegrams, invoices, receipts, writings, clippings, articles, an account book, and a volume listing his articles on torpedo warfare. The materials were a gift in 1912 to the Naval History Society from Ericsson's biographer William Conant Church, and the correspondence is annotated and underlined throughout in various colors, perhaps by him as part of his research for "The Life of John Ericsson" (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1890). Undated materials appear to have been from Church's research and papers, and include separated and unidentified documents. The materials are mostly in English, with some in Swedish and German.

Having shown early promise as an engineer, and holding numerous patents for steam-powered engines, he designed the first screw-driven steamship to cross the Atlantic (<title render="italic">Robert F. Stockton</title>, 1839) and the first propeller-driven steam warship for the US Navy (USS <title render="italic"> Princeton</title>, 1842). In 1861 he contracted with the Navy to build in 100 days an ironclad warship, <title render="italic"> Monitor</title>, which successfully fought the Confederate ironclad <title render="italic"> Virginia</title> (originally <title render="italic"> Merrimack</title>) at Hampton Roads on March 9, 1862, before sinking off Cape Hatteras later that year. After the Civil War, he pursued his interests in torpedo-armed vessels, and in a variety of scientific and engineering subjects, including solar energy. He died in New York in 1889 and was interred in Sweden in 1890.</p><p><emph render="bold">Related Materials at The New-York Historical Society</emph></p><p>A chronological inventory of the papers of

Barnes, in 1837 and began his maritime career as a midshipman in 1838. He served in various naval and mercantile vessels before retiring in 1856 to manage the Bay State Woolen Mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts. His suggestions for the relief of Fort Sumter were not followed, but through connections to Abraham Lincoln via Postmaster Montgomery Blair (his wife's brother-in-law) he was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy under Gideon Welles in 1861. He served in that position through the Civil War, functioning as de facto chief of naval operations. He championed the cause of ironclad fighting ships, supporting John Ericsson (see Series 16) in his bid to build <title render="italic">Monitor</title>. Fox is credited with improving the management of the Navy that made possible its wartime victories.</p><p>In 1866 he made the first transatlantic voyage in an ironclad (<title render="italic">Miantonomoh</title>) to deliver a congressional resolution to Tsar Alexander II, congratulating him on his escape from an assassination attempt. The ship made extensive stops in European ports en route. In 1867 he made an unsuccessful attempt to take over the Southwest Pacific railroad, the forerunner of the St. Louis-San Francisco railroad. In 1869 he began management of Middlesex Mills in Lowell, Massachusetts, moving to Boston in 1874 from where he commuted to Lawrence to manage Washington Mills for the commission house of Mudge, Sawyer, and Co. He retired in 1878 and pursued interests that included documenting Columbus's first landfall in the new world, and the local history and topography of New Hampshire.</p><p><emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p><p>The materials are arranged in 10 subseries:</p><p>Subseries I.

Many of the subseries were previously edited and arranged by Virginia Woodbury Fox and/or Colonel Robert Thompson in preparation for the latter's editing and publication of Fox's letters ("The Fox Papers, being the confidential correspondence of Gustavus V. Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the Civil War," Vols. I and II, edited by Colonel Robert M. Thompson and Rear Admiral Richard Wainwright and printed by DeVinne Press, New York, as the ninth and tenth volumes of the Society's publications) in 1918 and 1919. In some subseries, pages were numbered in order in pencil; in others Mrs. Fox has included notes about materials that she destroyed, erased, or otherwise redacted.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref421_bx7" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries I. Correspondence (1838-1883)</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_639ac53f32bbd5c1b279194b50fb758d"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>The correspondence includes incoming and outgoing letters, a small amount of which is personal and the bulk from Fox's tenure as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Some of the originals were rearranged and annotated by Virginia Woodbury Fox. Her notes indicate that she destroyed those she believed to be too personal. Marie Bayless, librarian of the Naval History Society, may have typed the transcripts as part of the letters' editing by Col. Thompson. Also included are letters received by James Paulding, Assistant Secretary of the Navy before Fox. No explanation is given for their presence in the collection.</p><p>The early letters received (1838-1860) are mostly orders to report to ships for duty, and include Fox's recommendation as a midshipman, signed by John Quincy Adams when he served as a representative from Massachusetts after his presidency. Among those in 1861 is one from Abraham Lincoln. Fox's other correspondents include John Ericsson (see Series 16) and General Ulysses S. Grant. The Civil War-era letters document routine activities of the Navy: orders, reports of activities, discussion of policy, personnel, and maneuvers. The later letters include correspondence regarding Fox's donation to St. John's Episcopal Church, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, of a credence table (to hold items required to celebrate Communion) made from the oak timbers of Admiral David Farragut's flagship <title render="italic"> Hartford</title>.</p><p><emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p><p>Some of the correspondence was arranged by month within a year and some by last name of recipient within a year.

The autographed letters include some addressed to President Andrew Jackson and then referred to the Secretary of the Navy, and show signatures of author Washington Irving, President Martin Van Buren, and politicians Robert Livingston and Thurlow Weed. The invitations include those to Lincoln's second inauguration in March, 1865; dinners with visiting Russian officers; and a ceremony marking the raising of the American flag over Fort Sumter after its recapture in 1865. Among the undated cards announcing an "at home" is one for the White House from President and Mrs. Lincoln.</p><p>The drawings include some by Admiral David Porter, who is probably the author and illustrator of the satirical volume. The photographs include one of a woman, perhaps Virginia Woodbury Fox, alone, and with members of her family; as well as an unidentified older African-American woman.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref656_m5n" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Letters to and from distinguished men</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1823-1841, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_e8eef6f3132794c06070da0a205ab8ce" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">18</container><container parent="aspace_e8eef6f3132794c06070da0a205ab8ce" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref657_uz6" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Invitations, passes, cards</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1861-1878</unitdate><container id="aspace_1f6b63ddb7166416ed75ea7f288585ba" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">18</container><container parent="aspace_1f6b63ddb7166416ed75ea7f288585ba" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref658_2yh" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Invitations, passes, cards</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[1860s]</unitdate><container id="aspace_1f404f5be9284103386a55d14b0f2c0a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">18</container><container parent="aspace_1f404f5be9284103386a55d14b0f2c0a" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref659_byj" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Satirical account of cut-off engines aboard U.S.S. <title render="italic">Richmond</title> and <title render="italic">Pensacola</title>: "The experiences of a poor devil with the concatenations of curtailing cut off or Uncle Sam paying dearly for his steam whistle - how our money goes"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[1860s]</unitdate><container id="aspace_052420d5782d484db277d2554a8c0d4c" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">18</container><container parent="aspace_052420d5782d484db277d2554a8c0d4c" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref660_ofj" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Drawings and caricatures: David D.

Notes in her hand indicate that she destroyed much of her correspondence to her husband. Among those letters saved, and specifically marked, is that of July 20, 1863, describing the Draft Riots in New York City.

Barnes. Levi Woodbury's letters received include those signed by Presidents Andrew Jackson (1835) and James Buchanan (1847) and by Senator Thomas Hart Benton (1851). The letters received are originals; the letters sent are letterpress copies, some of which are difficult to read. Most of the Barnes letters were in alphabetical order, which has been retained; the 1850-1851 letters were originally in the Levi Woodbury correspondence and have been moved here with their original order retained.</p><p><emph render="bold">Biographical Note</emph></p><p>Levi Woodbury (1789-1851) served as Secretary of the Navy (1831-1834), Secretary of the Treasury (1834-1841), United States senator (1841-1845), and Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court (1845-1851). The bulk of his and other Woodbury family papers are now in the Library of Congress. Levi Woodbury's sister Hannah (b. 1800) was married to Isaac O. Barnes (b. 1798). Gustavus Vasa Fox served as executor of Barnes's will. The materials give no indication of William Bowes Bradford's relation to the Woodbury family; G.W.M. Guild appears to have been a nephew of Fox's.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref714_ph2" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Levi Woodbury: Letters sent</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1832-1845</unitdate><container id="aspace_318ddba6e51cfa785a3f9aab9a39ae42" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_318ddba6e51cfa785a3f9aab9a39ae42" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref715_nyu" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Levi Woodbury: Letters received</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1832-1851, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_f62552396ca452436652b265beb70327" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_f62552396ca452436652b265beb70327" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref716_pgi" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>William Bowes Bradford: will</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1835</unitdate><container id="aspace_723da7d788ff983d13f4c3c2c8d925a2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_723da7d788ff983d13f4c3c2c8d925a2" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref717_1nu" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Isaac O.

"But by diligent search, undertaken on the order of the Minister of Marine, upon the solicitation of the Secretary of the Society..., the lost records were found - the logbooks of all of De Grasse's ships, the dispatches received from the Admiral and the letter-book of orders issued to him from Paris." These were transcribed for the Society by the French government and were included in the seventh volume of its publications: "The Despatches of Thomas Graves, R.N., 1781," edited by Rear Admiral French E.

John Meigs's January 1909 letters discuss the formation of a naval historical society and in that year John Sanford Barnes sends draft bylaws of the Naval Historical Society, comparing it to Britain's Naval Records Society.

Also included are a newspaper clipping and a list of personal items, perhaps from the Goodrich residence, found with the lecture materials. "The Problem of 96" is one of the annual examinations by College cadets of a challenge in coastal defense: the 1896 one looked at a specific part of nearby Narragansett Bay. This is an early precursor of the theoretical "war games" the College famously initiated.</p><p>The numbered lectures were delivered in order as part of a series on famous international naval encounters, from the Battle of Sluys in 1340 to Drake's destruction of King Phillip's fleet in Cadiz Harbor in 1587, Napoleon's Nile Campaign of 1798, and the 1827 Battle of Navarino during the Greek War of Independence. These form the backdrop for Goodrich's final multipart lecture on Dewey's engagement in Manila during the Spanish-American War, which had occurred only three years before these lectures.

The latter includes a typescript with handwritten emendations probably by James Barnes, who edited the work for publication by the Naval History Society ("Rope yarns from the old navy," published by J.J. Little &amp; Ives Co., as the eleventh volume of the Society's publications), and a final clean version incorporating those changes. The memoirs are an affectionate look at his early service in the Navy, which he describes as "coincident with the great changes from sail to steam; from wooden frigates to steel dreadnoughts; from smooth bore muzzle loaders to breech loading rifled cannon; from man power to electricity."</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref806_gac" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Logistics</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[1901]</unitdate><container id="aspace_23b1176548910edeaf088ca98cc56d19" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_23b1176548910edeaf088ca98cc56d19" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref807_gef" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Coast defense</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[1901]</unitdate><container id="aspace_85a16db792b0ea6c0ab79afce6df9dcb" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_85a16db792b0ea6c0ab79afce6df9dcb" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref808_rry" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Label from wrapper for writings on coast defense and logistics</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[1901]</unitdate><container id="aspace_952513937acf4a32c85fce994a7bf0e6" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_952513937acf4a32c85fce994a7bf0e6" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref809_80n" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Navigation</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[1901]</unitdate><container id="aspace_045f607c75e00cb2f9b9ffe2e3082db0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_045f607c75e00cb2f9b9ffe2e3082db0" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref810_d4k" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Interior water communication</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[1901]</unitdate><container id="aspace_e345077a517a554818f670eb58b5caa6" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_e345077a517a554818f670eb58b5caa6" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref811_wew" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Scouting for the U.S.S. <title render="italic">Tacony</title></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[1901]</unitdate><container id="aspace_b39188e41c21ded0b4a5fc724f623286" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_b39188e41c21ded0b4a5fc724f623286" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref812_rke" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Dutch - French - English Wars of the 17th Century</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">[1901]</unitdate><container id="aspace_70fc6f2d922b87662169fcf5618f5626" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_70fc6f2d922b87662169fcf5618f5626" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref813_3g1" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Extracts from G.B.

James Barnes (Series 4). The series documents Jones himself, the history of the Barnes's collecting of Jones-related information and objects, and their efforts to determine the authenticity and veracity of these. It includes John Sanford Barnes's correspondence with various Jones biographers and collectors, typed transcripts of Jones's ships' logbooks and personal correspondence, photoreproductions of original items in Barnes's and other collections, clippings and other published materials, Col. James Barnes's writings on Jones, and undated and unattributed notes about the provenance and acquisition of Jones-related material.</p><p>The original documents carry the signatures of Jones himself on a letter to DeNeufville introducing John Barry and, on his commission aboard <title render="italic"> Providence</title>, that of John Hancock. The clippings document a report of the finding of Jones's body in Paris in 1903, the 1909 appearance of <title render="italic"> Ranger</title>'s logbooks and a separate auction of Jones material, information from the Russian archives in 1926, and the Naval History Society's participation in placement of a new headstone at the grave of Jones's brother William Jones in Fredericksburg, VA, in 1930. It is not clear who added the 1976 clipping on the purported finding of the wreck of <title render="italic"> Bon Homme Richard</title>.</p><p>The correspondence documents organizations and individuals interested in Jones material, including the Library of Congress (the Manuscripts Division published "A calendar of John Paul Jones manuscripts in the Library of Congress" in 1903); biographer Anna deKoven (author of the 1913 "The letters of John Paul Jones"); and Grenville Kane, the Naval History Society's treasurer who was acknowledged as the greatest collector of Jones material. There is both a clean and an edited version of the typed transcript of Jones's correspondence, which Col. James Barnes may have planned to publish.</p><p>Some of the photocopied material shows penciled notes on the original items' provenance and history. The Beaumont Groube material documents John Sanford Barnes's effort to determine, through a handwriting comparison, the writer of <title render="italic"> Serapis</title>'s logbook (see Series 49). Photocopies of Jones's sealing wax imprint on the DeNeufville letter fueled continuing speculation about whether the seal itself had originally been a gift to him from Marie Antoinette.</p><p>The commission signed by Hancock, Jones's letter to DeNeufville, and correspondence to and from Barnes about Jones are available on microfilm.</p><p><emph render="bold">Historical Note</emph></p><p>John Paul Jones is among the most romantic and written-about figures in Revolutionary history. His raising of the first American flag aboard a naval vessel in 1776, his response to the British call to surrender <title render="italic"> Bon Homme Richard</title> of "I have not yet begun to fight," and his victory aboard that vessel over <title render="italic"> Serapis</title> in 1779 are elements of American nation-building with almost mythic significance. John Sanford Barnes's Jones collection was a product of his general interest in naval history (with a focus on heroic exploits) magnified by his often-mentioned family connection with Jones's contemporaries Commodore Bainbridge (see Series 1) and Admiral Barry (see Series 5): Barnes's wife's grandfather James Hayes was a nephew of and adopted by John Barry; his wife's mother was Bainbridge's daughter, Sarah Bainbridge Hayes.</p><p>The early 20th century saw the publication of many biographies and articles about Jones's personal life and exploits. Their prevalence is perhaps attributable to the general increased focus on naval contributions to military victories after the Spanish American War in 1898 and efforts to build a "new American navy" for the new century. In 1900 August Buell published the widely quoted and later disparaged "Paul Jones: Founder of the American Navy"; in 1905 James Barnes's own "The personal appearance of John Paul Jones" was published in Appleton's <title render="italic">Booklover's Magazine</title>. The Naval History Society's first publication was "Logs of the <title render="italic"> Serapis</title>, <title render="italic"> Alliance</title>, and <title render="italic"> Ariel</title> under the Command of John Paul Jones, 1778-1780," edited by John Sanford Barnes, and printed by De Vinne Press, New York, in 1911, based on the original and transcribed logbooks (see Series 49) in his personal collection. Anna deKoven's biography (for which she consulted Barnes and his collection) was published in 1913, and in 1917 Don Seitz published "Paul Jones: His exploits in English seas during 1778 to 1780." Each added new information and raised further questions about details of Jones's life and genealogy, accomplishments, death, and burial, which were discussed both privately in correspondence among authors and collectors, and publicly in newspaper letters columns. </p><p><emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p><p>The 18th century materials are arranged chronologically.

In 1881 he was elected fellow of the American Philosophical Society, and was the author of works on Egyptology including a dictionary of hieroglyphics published by the Society.</p><p>As a midshipman in 1852 he was aboard USS <title render="italic"> Powhatan</title>, the flagship of Admiral Matthew Perry, when it departed Norfolk for Japan and entered Tokyo Bay on February 14, 1854. Perry oversaw signing of the first treaty with Japan on March 31, opening that country to commercial contact with the West.</p></scopecontent><altformavail id="aspace_86621dbf5538459f8e330315bef9e290"><head>Existence and Location of Copies</head><p>Digital copy of the diary is available in the <emph render="bold"><extref xlink:href="http://digitalcollections.nyhistory.org/islandora/object/islandora%3A115073#page/1/mode/2up">Shelby White and Leon Levy Digital Library</extref>.</emph></p></altformavail><c id="aspace_ref911_iv6" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Correspondence received</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1872 November 20 - 1873 June 20</unitdate><container id="aspace_13af25ca83872b5829086cd2a50401b0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_13af25ca83872b5829086cd2a50401b0" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref912_4t7" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Correspondence received</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1873 June 28 - November 14</unitdate><container id="aspace_26709882e09ea4a081ba015def99aa6d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_26709882e09ea4a081ba015def99aa6d" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref913_ns7" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Correspondence received</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1873 November 22 -1874 March 6</unitdate><container id="aspace_a9495071140483d5212daa99add6a9ef" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_a9495071140483d5212daa99add6a9ef" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref914_k7h" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Correspondence received</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1874 March 16 - September 21</unitdate><container id="aspace_3fd23589d2e7b483de48949cb3398b4a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_3fd23589d2e7b483de48949cb3398b4a" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref915_tla" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Correspondence received</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1874 Sept 29 - November 30</unitdate><container id="aspace_f0e81c3b78def6a7a5d0c44feacf6244" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_f0e81c3b78def6a7a5d0c44feacf6244" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref916_nsv" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Orders and telegrams</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1874 October 28 - 1876 July 14</unitdate><container id="aspace_ca25e666502cecc988defaee9177cb59" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_ca25e666502cecc988defaee9177cb59" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref917_etr" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Photoreproductions, color: Japan diary, 1854</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_ce99b4d83ae6debf6dd43d5e3c7e8676" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_ce99b4d83ae6debf6dd43d5e3c7e8676" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref918_hm6" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Photoreproductions, black and white: Japan diary, 1854</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_95ccd222f8dba29f98f94315260b6ec5" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_95ccd222f8dba29f98f94315260b6ec5" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref919_lzu" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Seamanship and gunnery</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1845 January 9 - 1847 April 14</unitdate><container id="aspace_6d1bef0c647b1193c11d8b403f48b0b0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref920_edu" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Diary</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1853 February 13 - 1854 June 10</unitdate><container id="aspace_62fd70463b008663ef92e51d98de51b0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">2</container></did><altformavail id="aspace_b0c5a1f3b155435731475435e2750231"><head>Existence and Location of Copies</head><p>Digital copy of the diary is available in the <emph render="bold"><extref xlink:href="http://digitalcollections.nyhistory.org/islandora/object/islandora%3A115073#page/1/mode/2up">Shelby White and Leon Levy Digital Library</extref>.</emph></p></altformavail></c><c id="aspace_ref921_wka" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Letterpress book</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1873 August - 1877 March</unitdate><container id="aspace_7661a39ee03b63b775f6ca7818e1ce3e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">3</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref923_6fr" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 30.

The 1891 copy of "Northwestern Architect" includes a description of the Navy Department's exhibition planned for the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago on page 63. The letterpress copies of 1894-1895 had been disbound from a letterpress book. The John Paul Jones material includes Admiral Meade's lecture presentation to the United Service Club in 1896 and information on his daughter Annie Paulding Meade's presentation on the subject in 1899. The scrapbook materials were found with miscellaneous papers of the Naval History Society and removed to this series.</p><p>Many of the materials bear a sticker with the Naval History Society's seal that reads "From the Library of Richard Worsam Meade 4th (1870-1833), son of Richard Worsam Meade (3rd), Rear Admiral U.S.N., presented by Mrs. Richard Worsam Meade (4th), May 3, 1934". Subsequent contributions to the collection are documented through 1937.</p><p>Portions of this collection relating to the Civil War have been digitized and are available to on-site researchers and to users affiliated with subscribing institutions via <extref xlink:href="http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/results?sid=100edece-435b-44c9-8d77-a6a870454678%40sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4104&amp;bquery=%28HJ+FBIY%29+OR+%28HJ+FBIZ%29&amp;bdata=JmRiPWg1YyZ0eXBlPTEmc2l0ZT1laG9zdC1saXZl">EBSCOhost</extref>.</p><p><emph render="bold">Related Materials at The New-York Historical Society</emph></p><p>The Naval History Society's Miscellaneous Manuscripts collection (see Series 52) contains additional correspondence between Admiral Meade and John Sanford Barnes about John Paul Jones.</p><p> The "Scrapbook of R.W.

The clipping is from the papers of Richard Worsam Meade 3rd (see Series 31) in the library of his son, Richard Worsam Meade 4th, and was presented to the Naval History Society by his widow on May 3, 1934.</p><p><emph render="bold">Historical Note</emph></p><p>Part of the romance and power of John Paul Jones's role in revolutionary history is the probably apocryphal story of his having flown the first American flag over his vessel <title render="italic">Bon Homme Richard</title>. From that ship, according to often-repeated stories, the flag fell into the ocean, was rescued by young Lt. James Stafford, and given to him by Jones in thanks for his bravery. His daughter, Sarah Smith Stafford became the flag's owner and then willed it to her brother Samuel Bayard Stafford. It was eventually donated to the Smithsonian Institution, which exhibited it until the 1930s when it was determined not to be authentic and removed from view.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1084_jm3" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>History of the Flag of the Frigate <title render="italic">The Bon Homme Richard</title>, owned by the late Miss Sarah Smith Stafford and willed by her to her brother Samuel Bayard Stafford</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1895</unitdate><container id="aspace_51d386716b266bf61699b1c637592855" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">1</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref1086_n8f" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 43.

Roberts, New York agent for the US Mail Steam Ship Company; logs of ships on voyages between New York and Panama via New Orleans and Havana, and from Panama to California; a checkbook; a provision list; and both blank and completed tickets and contracts for passage aboard various ships on US Mail Steam Ship Company and other companies' vessels on these routes.</p><p>Robert's 1848-1849 and 1848-1850 letter books (Volumes 1 and 2) are indexed by recipients. Some of the logbooks document various commanding officers and multiple journeys back and forth along the same maritime routes between New York and San Francisco. They include details of weather, winds, other vessels passed, and crew actions, but do not otherwise document shipboard life. The provisions list is a preprinted listing of possible foodstuffs and other supplies needed for voyages, with blanks to be filled in with the name of vessel, estimate of passengers and number of days of travel, and the amount of each supply. The checkbook consists predominantly of blank checks; a few have been drawn. The foldered receipts and tickets appear to have been removed from ledger volumes of the same type as the SS <title render="italic">Antelope</title> tickets in Volume 9.</p><p><emph render="bold">Historical Note</emph></p><p>Complete transcontinental railroad travel became possible in 1869 and direct shipping from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1914 with the completion of the Panama Canal. Before then, travel between New York and the West coast required sailing to the Atlantic coast of Panama (usually with stops en route in New Orleans, Havana, and sometimes Jamaica), transit across the isthmus, followed by the Pacific journey to San Francisco. The Atlantic harbor in Panama was Chagras until 1855, when it was moved to Aspinwall (founded in 1850 and named for railway builder William Aspinwall; renamed Colon in 1890).</p><p>Marshall O. Roberts in 1847 had purchased the contract to provide mail steamships to the US government. He would realize enormous profits from the shipping demands of the California Gold Rush and the Civil War. The US Mail Steam Ship Company operated on the Atlantic coast of the United States, and William H. Aspinwall's Pacific Mail Steamship Company on the Pacific. Transit across the isthmus was by mule, wagon, or foot until 1851 when the Vanderbilt Line opened a route through Nicaragua. In 1855 the isthmus railroad connection was inaugurated.</p><p><emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p><p>The materials are arranged chronologically by material type except for the three logbooks of <title render="italic">Georgia</title>, which are grouped together for continuity.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1087_1lp" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Receipts for transportation contracts, North American Steamship Company, <title render="italic">Arago</title></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1867 December 18 - 1868 January 2</unitdate><container id="aspace_60ac5722a6524d2ef161ce87740f474c" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_60ac5722a6524d2ef161ce87740f474c" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1088_lvs" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Tickets: Opposition Line of steamers to California (completed):<title render="italic"> Arago</title></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1868 January 4</unitdate><container id="aspace_07ffe7781604266097662360f4824dfd" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_07ffe7781604266097662360f4824dfd" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1089_17n" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Transit tickets: Central American Transit Company, San Juan del Norte to San Juan del Sur</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1860s</unitdate><container id="aspace_c5f5b2b8da8f27716f93804d73581bda" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_c5f5b2b8da8f27716f93804d73581bda" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1090_cs8" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Tickets: North American Steamship Company, Central American Transit Company, New York to San Francisco, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class cabins</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1860s</unitdate><container id="aspace_d02252f59aa458a794086f68cdc01055" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_d02252f59aa458a794086f68cdc01055" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1091_j4s" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Contracts: M.O.

Rodgers' squadron, carried the US Minister to China on a diplomatic mission to Korea in April, 1871, attempting to open Korea to contact as Perry had earlier done in Japan (cf. Series 29). Attacks from shore batteries on two ships of the squadron as it made soundings in the Han River led American forces to begin a punitive expedition. It destroyed the forts and inflicted heavy casualties on the Koreans, with minimal loss of American lives.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1127_csq" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Clippings: <title render="italic">Harper's Weekly</title></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1871 September 9</unitdate><container id="aspace_aea6d6a1efe4708d67c6f932b825f541" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_aea6d6a1efe4708d67c6f932b825f541" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1128_wh9" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Photocopy: "Americans in Eastern Asia," by Tyler Dennett, pp. 452-453</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1922</unitdate><container id="aspace_824441ff91ba119a6b29388f22eb5d77" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_824441ff91ba119a6b29388f22eb5d77" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1129_dmu" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Our Other War in Korea," by William M.

The letters provide details of the ordering, manufacturing and testing of ordnance, as well as everyday personal introductions and invitations. His correspondents include Percival Drayton, commander of the ironclad <title render="italic">Passaic</title> and Superintendent of Ordnance at the New York Navy Yard; R. Aulick, Assistant Chief, Bureau of Ordnance; Commander R.B. Hitchcock; Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox (see Series 17); <title render="italic">Monitor</title> designer John Ericsson (see Series 16); Admiral David Porter, whose 1862 correspondence includes humorous sketches of anthropomorphic armaments; public official Hamilton Fish; and Theodore P. Greene (see Series 24).</p><p>Comments penciled on letters in letter book 10 imply that their publication was planned: "Drayton letters, almost without exception, are well worth printing"; and "Those relating to Navy agents and [. . .] (for example) are very pertinent. They should appear". There is no indication within the series that they were published.</p><p><emph render="bold">Biographical Note</emph></p><p>Henry Augustus Wise (1819-1869) entered the Navy as a midshipman in 1834. During the Mexican War (1846-1848) he saw action in the Gulf of California, and then became an expert on gunnery. When the Civil War began, Wise had to decide between staying in the US Navy and serving his home state of Virginia for the Confederacy. He retained his commission, and among his first duties was the burning of Gosport Navy Yard (Norfolk, VA). After a few months on blockade duty he was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, the agency responsible for the Navy's armaments and the shore stations where they were produced and tested. He became acting chief in 1863 and was appointed chief in 1864, which position he held until illness necessitated his resignation in 1868. He died in Naples, Italy, the next year.</p><p><emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p><p>The letters were previously disbound from letter books and numbered for indexing in approximate chronological order.

It includes lists of officers and men aboard <title render="italic">Ariel</title> under the command of Jones, and deserters from <title render="italic">Bon Homme Richard</title>; was kept on board <title render="italic">Serapis</title> from September 26, 1779, to October 14, 1780; and aboard <title render="italic">Queen of France</title> in August and September of 1782.

The volume includes drawings and writing at the end, probably by the child or children of Murray Mason, Fairfax County, Virginia. A midshipman at the time of this log, he may have been on <title render="italic">Ontario</title> and returned home with the book.</p><p>USS <title render="italic"> Potomac</title> departed New York in August, 1831, on its first overseas cruise to join the Pacific Station via the Cape of Good Hope. On February 6, 1832, it shelled Quallah Batoo, Sumatra, in retaliation for the February, 1831, capture of merchant vessel <title render="italic">Friendship</title> and the murder of her crew. The logbook was kept by midshipman James L. Parker. In the volume are two newspaper clippings: "View of the Castle of San Juan d'Ulua with the burning of the Mexican brig Creole by Lieutenant James Lawrence Parker and passed midshipmen Hynson and Rodgers USN" (undated) and from "The Daily chronicle and General Advertiser" of August 7, 1847, a memoriam from Commodore Matthew C. Perry on Parker's July 12, 1847, death from disease brought on by wounds sustained in an attack on Tuspan, Mexico.</p><p>The <title render="italic">Constelation</title> [sic] and <title render="italic">Grampus</title> logbooks are bound on continuous sheets that appear to have been removed from a previously sewn volume. The title page of each shows a hand-rendered drawing of the ship at full sail.</p><p>The 1844 <title render="italic">Constitution</title> logbook documents a cruise to the African coast off Madagascar. It includes hand-drawn maps of the area showing the ship's route and one with soundings documented; appendices on "Madagascar," "Hints on the Economy of a Man of War" (noting health and cleanliness issues on a long cruise to an unhealthy place), "The comparative merits of hemp and chain cables…valuable extract from a report transmitted by the Board of Admiralty by Captain W.F.

Miscellaneous manuscripts</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0c381070669cfa59892ed63f9c3c62b4"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>The series consists of more than 1100 letters, clippings, reprints, and other documents amassed by John Sanford Barnes and others to, from, and about notable persons including many with named series in this collection (e.g., William Bainbridge [Series 1], John Barry [Series 5], French E. Chadwick [Series 8], Gustavus Conyngham [Series 10], Gustavus Vasa Fox [Series 17], Caspar F. Goodrich [Series 21], Isaac Hull [Series 27], John Paul Jones [Series 28], Richard Worsam Meade 3rd [Series 31], Oliver Hazard Perry [Series 36], Henry A. Wise [Series 48]).</p><p>The organization of the materials into this series is somewhat arbitrary. In some cases a document was removed from a named collection and specifically located here (see Henry A. Wise letter removed from letter book). In other cases there was not sufficient material on a particular person to warrant creation of a series. Individual signatures have, in some instances, been cut from their original document for inclusion here, and a name does not necessarily signify an autograph document: the Jefferson material consists of a letter addressed to him. Some folders function more as subject files than manuscript collections: they may include information collected about a person rather than correspondence to or from them.</p><p>Some of the letters are addressed to Captain Barnes; others show evidence of having been purchased by him or donated to the Naval History Society. Many are addressed to Captain Garrett J. Pendergrast, commander of the Philadelphia Navy Yard. No explanation is given for their inclusion here in such profusion. Some documents have been mounted for display and/or sale; on a few the purchase price is marked in pencil.</p><p>This series functions in parallel and complementary to the previous 51 series in the collection. Together with Barnes's List of officers' autograph letters signed (Series 44) and his documentation of extra-illustrations for Cooper's "History of the Navy of the United States" (Series 11), it further documents his, and the Society's, collection and organization of autograph materials.</p><p>The extensive Bainbridge materials in this series provide additional evidence of the Barnes family's interest in, and collecting activities related to, their illustrious forebear. Information organized here on the location and history of documents complements that in Dearborn's extra-illustrated life of Bainbridge (Series 1). The John Paul Jones material (foldered here under John Sanford Barnes) could as well have been part of Series 28, since it includes additional correspondence of Barnes with Jones's biographer Anna deKoven, and about Robert Dale and the donation of a sword purportedly owned by him and now in the collection of New-York Historical Society. </p><p>Highlights of the series include documents signed by Presidents John Quincy Adams (Bainbridge folder 5, Barry folder 1) and James Madison; others signed by John C. Calhoun, Salmon P. Chase, Richard Henry Dana, David Farragut, Robert Fulton, John Hancock, Rufus King, Seth Low, Robert Morris, and Matthew C. Perry; and a lock of Abraham Lincoln's hair removed after his death and sent by Robert Todd Lincoln to Gustavus Vasa Fox (removed from Series 17; now in Series 52, Box 5) at the latter's request.</p><p>Caspar Goodrich's 1907 letter of thanks for Barnes' sympathies at the death of Goodrich's son includes mention of the young man's portrait as a boy painted by John Singer Sargeant. Among David Porter's letters are cartoons and drawings by him, including one of animal-headed naval officers listening to explanations of the value of steam-powered vessels, which complement others in the Fox collection (Series 17). The William Smith folder includes a map of an attack on Whampoa, China, in 1870. It is unclear what Barnes's connection was to Nikola Tesla: letters from him indicate that he had visited Barnes in New York in 1904. The William C. Whitney document appears to be a personal financial report related to stock holdings but has been retained here.</p><p><emph render="bold">Historical Note</emph></p><p>Miscellaneous manuscripts collections are artificial gatherings of single or small groups of letters, often including individual letters signed by notable persons. As such, they can be troves of autograph or highpoint materials, a specialty of later 19th and early 20th century correspondence collectors. They document that era of collecting tastes and do not reflect modern archival precepts of original order or the maintenance of a document's physical or historical context or provenance.</p><p><emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p><p>The series is arranged alphabetically by the subject's name, with Miscellaneous collections placed at the end of a letter's run. It includes an index organized by 200 "portfolio" numbers, probably referring to the collection's original alphabetical order. This provides detailed descriptions of individual documents, which can be matched to the current alphabetical arrangement.</p><p><emph render="bold">Related Material at The New-York Historical Society</emph></p><p> John Sanford Barnes detailed his collecting interests and activities in a lecture he delivered at the Naval War College in 1902, which was published as "Naval Literature" by Captain John S. Barnes in <title render="italic">Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute</title>, volume XXIX, no. 2, whole no. 106, p. 32 (XN E182 .B26).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1267_vk2" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Index</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_7b2ef9d2cb149edd7a19e177e8833df5" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_7b2ef9d2cb149edd7a19e177e8833df5" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1268_6ud" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Adams, Henry A.: Letters</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1860, 1864</unitdate><container id="aspace_224c0b7b3a122b1acd86f8483392d476" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_224c0b7b3a122b1acd86f8483392d476" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1269_3f9" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Adams, John Quincy: Midshipman's warrant, ship's passport</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1825, 1826</unitdate><container id="aspace_28e0aaa9df7efc862078b80fa7806e53" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_28e0aaa9df7efc862078b80fa7806e53" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1270_0xf" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Agassiz, Jean Louis Rodolphe: Letter</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1869</unitdate><container id="aspace_1b436fc31609d129d322a75097e4f5e1" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_1b436fc31609d129d322a75097e4f5e1" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1271_8em" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Almy, John J.: Letters</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1834 [?] - 1870</unitdate><container id="aspace_e20f598797925805094fd92672e6899d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_e20f598797925805094fd92672e6899d" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1272_1zw" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Amory, E.

They document the establishment and administration of the Society from its foundation until it ceased independent operations: its formation, officers and bylaws, membership, finances, library and manuscript collecting activities, and its editing and publication of volumes based on materials in its manuscript collections. It shows the context of naval and maritime collecting by the Society through its officers' correspondence with members and other collectors, authors, historical societies and repositories, and the Office of Naval Records, Washington, DC; as well as the organization's internal governance and workings. </p><p><emph render="bold">Historical Note</emph></p><p>According to the 1915 catalog of the library of Naval History Society founder John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3), "The Naval History Society has been established for the purpose of publishing and preserving manuscripts, documents, and writings relating to our naval history, naval art and science, and the surroundings and experiences of seamen in general and of American seamen in particular."</p><p>The Naval History Society Collection began with the donation to the Society in 1915 of Barnes's personal collections by his son, Col. James Barnes (see Series 4). The donation included library materials now cataloged in the XN classification in the New-York Historical Society Library, artifacts now included in the New-York Historical Society's museum collections, as well as the manuscript materials described in Series 1-52 of this Collection. The entire collection was donated to the New-York Historical Society, where the Naval History Society collections and office were then located, in 1925. Additional materials were donated by Naval History Society members and others or acquired by purchase after that date, some from the Naval History Fund established at the New-York Historical Society from the Naval History Society's monies.</p><p>A chronology of the Society's publishing activities is provided in Subseries VI. Manuscript collections and Society publication records.</p><p><emph render="bold">Chronology of the Naval History Society</emph></p><p>1909: Meeting convenes at the New York Yacht Club to discuss formation of a naval history society. Attendees include Admiral Caspar Goodrich (see Series 21), William Conant Church (biographer of John Ericsson [Series 16]), Col. James Barnes (see Series 4), and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who serves as the meeting's secretary. John Sanford Barnes is unanimously elected president and Robert Neeser secretary-treasurer. A committee is authorized to inquire if the New-York Historical Society would serve as the Naval History Society's home.</p><p>1911: John Sanford Barnes dies.</p><p>1912: Naval History Society incorporated. Its offices are located at 247 Fifth Avenue, although some early meetings are held in Washington, DC.</p><p>1915: James Barnes donates the collections of his father John Sanford Barnes to the Naval History Society in June. They include original manuscripts, letters, and logbooks as well as published books, pamphlets, and prints (approximately 3,570 volumes and separate items). The Society rents space in Aeolian Hall on West 42nd Street to house the collection.</p><p>1915: Secretary Robert Neeser corresponds with New-York Historical Society President John Abeel Weekes in May to ask if the Historical Society is interested in acquiring the Naval History Society collections and providing a room where it can be preserved for research and exhibition. Naval History Society, "being primarily a publication society...has...no habitat or place where these priceless and unique books could be preserved."</p><p>1915: New-York Historical Society Executive Committee responds to Neeser's request: "Owing to the crowded condition of the present building, the Captain Barnes collection was respectfully declined as a deposit."</p><p>1915: The John S. Barnes Memorial Library is transferred to the Naval History Society in September.</p><p>1916: John S. Barnes Memorial Library of the Naval History Society opens January 10 in Aeolian Hall. Marie Bayless serves as librarian.</p><p>1916: The Society holds an exhibition of the Library's books, prints, and manuscripts of John Paul Jones [see Series 28] in April, and in May of its Gustavus Conyngham memorabilia [see Series 10).</p><p>1917: The Society holds an exhibition of its Revolutionary War books, prints, and manuscripts in March, and in April on the War of 1812.</p><p>1918: Col. James Barnes elected President, a position he holds until his death in 1936.</p><p>1920: Alice M. Kyte becomes librarian.</p><p>1923: Franklin D. Roosevelt is deputized by the Building Committee to contact New-York Historical Society about collaborating on space and collections.</p><p>1925: Naval History Society relocates to New-York Historical Society, which was expanding its storage and exhibition spaces, and its members automatically become Associate members of New-York Historical Society. The $15,000 Naval History Fund is also transferred, to be used to purchase additional materials for the collection.</p><p>1930: Naval History Society participates in the restoration of gravestone for William Paul (brother of John Paul Jones; see Series 28), in St. George's Churchyard, Fredericksburg, VA.</p><p>1932: Naval History Society materials are represented in New-York Historical Society's "Ships and Steamboats" exhibition.</p><p>1936: Collection of dues and publication activities are suspended following the death of Col. James Barnes and insufficient Naval History Fund monies to purchase additional materials.</p><p><emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p><p>The records are arranged in seven subseries:</p><p>Subseries I.

The President's reports (1928-1935, by Col. James Barnes) provide details of manuscript acquisitions and provenance, and the Society's publications for each year. The Secretary's reports (1926-1929, 1931-1935) focus on membership news: new members gained and those lost through death or resignation. The Treasurer's reports (1925-1936 by Robert Neeser) include information on the Naval History Fund, which was used to purchase additional library and manuscript materials.</p><p>The original certificate of incorporation is signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, before he became Assistant Secretary of the Navy, in his position at the Society's Secretary. The 1923-1924 Annual reports include James Barnes's own annotated copy. This edition includes a complete history of the Society to date: founders, minutes of annual meeting, resolutions, details on the collections and publications, and information on memorial activities in 1924 honoring Rear Admiral Thayer Mahan.</p><p><emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p><p>Printed letters sent to all members were moved to Subseries II.

Also represented are Col. James Barnes when he was active as President of the Society, Treasurer Grenville Kane, and attorney Herbert Satterlee. The correspondence documents all aspects of the Society's functions, including membership dues notices, publication of Naval History Society editions by The DeVinne Press and others, cataloging of Naval History Society publications by the Library of Congress, payment for or receipt of publications by members, research requests, and payment and other banking transactions. Contact with the New-York Historical Society begins in 1915 with formation of a Building Committee and discussion of a possible move of the collections from rented space in Aeolian Hall to the Historical Society's location, culminating in the move in 1925. Among that correspondence is a letter signed by Franklin Roosevelt. A November, 1936, letter to the membership announces the end of the publication program due to insufficient monies in the Naval History Fund.</p><p><emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p><p>Most of the correspondence was originally bundled in multiple envelopes for each year, usually organized alphabetically by last name of correspondent. Exceptions included envelopes for 1909, which were arranged chronologically in one envelope; 1917, which began as an alphabetical run but sometimes included correspondence dating to 1923; 1920, which was bundled together with 1924; and various years for which there was only one envelope containing all correspondence, especially later in the Society's history. Some large runs of correspondence to one recipient or on a particular subject were labeled as such and stored together. Those divisions have been retained, but folders have been arranged in chronological order.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1465_2nk" level="otherlevel"

The provenance of these materials is unclear; some of the earlier items may have come from the collections of John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3). Materials separated from named collections include an 1851 invitation to Lieutenant Duer (see Series 14), various undated photographs labeled as from Admiral McCauley (see Series 21), and a 1906 invitation to a Naval Ball honoring Rear Admiral Goodrich (see Series 29).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1786_kv9" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Ephemera separated from named collections: Duer, Goodrich, McCauley</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1851, 1906, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_cbd46a50af53df0ba51d50eb91782c7e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">33</container><container parent="aspace_cbd46a50af53df0ba51d50eb91782c7e" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1787_vzr" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Invitations and programs</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1883-1936</unitdate><container id="aspace_abea333e92fb1bbe8fe084049f2d0778" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">33</container><container parent="aspace_abea333e92fb1bbe8fe084049f2d0778" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1788_d0z" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Various ephemera and clippings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1911, 1917, 1918, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_d3e03f256b63670f9075d6c6454c8175" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">33</container><container parent="aspace_d3e03f256b63670f9075d6c6454c8175" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1789_chh" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Naval-themed postage stamps</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1936, 1945, 1947</unitdate><container id="aspace_0281ce58e840e97d1720edf6ad877a7f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">33</container><container parent="aspace_0281ce58e840e97d1720edf6ad877a7f" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1790_oc6" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Bookplates and calling cards</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_036aa88d7a1e662f3075945dbe71f2ba" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">33</container><container parent="aspace_036aa88d7a1e662f3075945dbe71f2ba" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1791_26e" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Reproduced images</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_ae74a4d19148b885c551115b746002dc" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">33</container><container parent="aspace_ae74a4d19148b885c551115b746002dc" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1792_cip" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Scrapbook of clippings on naval topics</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1913-1916</unitdate><container id="aspace_ff7e36cc048f3a182add8bf99e60d347" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">17</container></did></c></c></c></dsc>
