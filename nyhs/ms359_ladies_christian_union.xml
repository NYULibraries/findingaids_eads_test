    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Ladies' Christian Union (LCU) collection documents 140 years of efforts to provide safe and affordable housing to young Christian women in New York City. The collection is arranged by type of material and contains administrative materials, photographs, brochures, articles, and comprehensive information on the houses, boarders, members, and history of the LCU. <emph render="bold">Portions of this collection have been digitized and can be viewed </emph> <extref xlink:href="http://cdm16694.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16124coll1">here</extref>.</p><p>This collection's strength is its overview of young women working and studying in New York City from 1858-2001. The Annual Reports describe the changes in young women's professions, fields of study, recreational interests, and political concerns. For instance, early occupations of boarders included teachers, seamstresses, governesses, telegraph operators, and milliners while professions in the twentieth century began to include drama students, secretaries, librarians, and eventually, business and engineering students. Similarly, the patriotic work of the women during World War II contrasts with views from the 1968 Annual Report describing the difficulty of providing for young women, "while they are loudly rejecting everything current, including both the domestic and foreign policies of this country." </p><p>The early annual reports also recount the number of foreign residents and the number of girls who left the house to marry. The reports describe the large number of illnesses and deaths among the women living in the homes and how the LCU eventually provided nurses and health insurance to its residents. Other items include a ledger book of boarders from 1864-1870 and minutes of general meetings and house meetings, which reveal conflicts with boarders and circumstances when young women were asked to leave. </p><p>The collection also supports research on the general history of the administration and membership of the LCU. Claiming to be the first women's Christian association in the world, the LCU was a model for other women's Christian efforts such as the YWCA. The administrative files, particularly the annual reports, demonstrate the rise of the organization and the successes and challenges of its efforts. The collection also documents the early devotional work of the organization. Originally, the LCU focused on devotional work, including a Devotional Committee which oversaw prayer meetings and its Band of Prayer, and Christian housing. The files show how the organization began concentrating less on its devotional work and more on the operation of its houses. The Annual Reports in the collection support research into the architectural history of the various LCU buildings, and some of the general meeting and house meeting minutes describe local crime incidents. </p><p>Notable items in the collection include two letters from writer and photographer, Jacob Riis to the LCU administration regarding complaints from a boarder. Another item is a pamphlet entitled, "Behind the Lace Curtains of the YWCA," which attempts to expose the Communist infiltration of the YWCA. The collection includes three metal boxes that display the Ladies' Christian Union logo. </p>  </scopecontent>

They include the treasurer's report, the names of subscribers and members, a report on the devotional work for the year, and the constitution and bylaws of the organization. Annual Reports after 1895 include reports from the Annual Meetings. The annual reports also provide dated descriptions of the buildings used for boarders. They often describe the layout, decorations, and repairs or modernizations made to the buildings, such as additions of electricity or steam heat. They also list forms of entertainment provided for the girls such as sewing machines and a library and, eventually, televisions, stereos, and computers.</p><p>The annual reports also contain some general information on the boarders that the LCU served. They contain examples of the boarders' professions and their subjects of study and also include the number of girls who married or who suffered illnesses that year. Despite the fact that deaths were common, the Annual Reports from the nineteenth and early twentieth century focus on the healthfulness of their facilities. The Annual Reports also consistently reaffirm why affordable Christian housing is imperative to the young women of the age.</p><p>There were no annual reports created for 1999 and 2000.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref24_na0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual Reports</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1859/1869" type="inclusive">1859-1869</unitdate><container

The minutes contain discussion of the current business of the organization including statements from the treasurer, reports of various committees, and descriptions of issues concerning houses owned by the LCU. The minute books reveal details about the death of LCU members, issues with specific boarders, and particulars regarding the purchase and maintenance of LCU homes. The books also contain minutes of the Annual Meeting, usually held in January of each year. </p><p>Some of the meeting minutes are from monthly meetings (1868-1870 and 1914-1917) and others are from meetings held bimonthly (1871-1913). Because the LCU did not meet July through September, there are no minutes for those months in any year.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref53_5xh" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minute

This folder also contains two letters from Jacob Riis, conveying a complaint from a boarder to the LCU administration. The letters from Mrs. Caroline Roberts detail her spiritual life and her trip abroad in an attempt to convalesce. <emph render="bold">These materials have been digitized and can be viewed </emph> <extref xlink:href="http://cdm16694.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16124coll1/id/15127">here</extref>.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref138_fit" level="file"><did><unittitle>Notes and correspondence re the making of LCU brochures</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1940/1950" type="inclusive">1940-1950</unitdate><container id="aspace_c5b0a36dd58df5934020184495b66ca9" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">9</container><container parent="aspace_c5b0a36dd58df5934020184495b66ca9" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref139_9km" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letter to Churches Enclosing a LCU Brochure</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1977</unitdate><container id="aspace_bd96dcea23dfd1799e9160e3749f0ec7" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">9</container><container parent="aspace_bd96dcea23dfd1799e9160e3749f0ec7" type="Folder">11</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref140_s3u" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence re Articles about LCU Homes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1947/1956" type="inclusive">1947-1956</unitdate><container id="aspace_6a7639d46f5d5807c0dec1e60d5e4cf1" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">9</container><container parent="aspace_6a7639d46f5d5807c0dec1e60d5e4cf1" type="Folder">12</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref141_74l" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence re LCU footage in short film, "White Collar Girls"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1948/1948" type="inclusive">1948</unitdate><container id="aspace_95fe8a94d280baa51e2e632fe39f7c97" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">9</container><container parent="aspace_95fe8a94d280baa51e2e632fe39f7c97" type="Folder">13</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref142_so0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letters and Clippings re Boarder at Sage House and "the trouble she made"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1899/1901" type="inclusive">1899-1901</unitdate><container id="aspace_4ae63986287fafeed99017c61e32aea4" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">9</container><container parent="aspace_4ae63986287fafeed99017c61e32aea4" type="Folder">14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref143_zx7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letters from Caroline D.

Many of these photographs are featured in brochures of the LCU. The pictures of the residents include depictions of the girls eating in the dining hall, lounging in the "parlor," reading or watching television, and sitting outside in the garden or playing ping pong. The photographs of the buildings are organized by the name of the home whenever possible. The building photographs do not contain pictures of the residents, jusy pictures of the facades or empty interiors. Unfortunately, many of the interior and exterior shots cannot be identified with a particular home. There are only a few photographs of the administrators and workers within the homes.
