    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Bernard Gotfryd was born in 1924 in Radom, Poland, and became interested in photography at an early age. When World War II broke out and schools were closed to Jewish students, Gotfryd found work as an apprentice in a photography studio. While working in the studio, he began aiding the Polish underground by passing on photographs taken by Nazi officers of war atrocities. After an unsuccessful escape attempt in October 1943, Gotfryd was apprehended and shipped to Maidanek. By the war's end, Gotfryd had survived six concentration camps. </p><p>In 1947, Gotfryd immigrated to the United States, where he worked as a photographer and studied photojournalism. After being drafted into the U.S. Army in 1949 and going through basic training, Gotfryd was assigned to the Signal Corps as a combat photographer. In 1952, he married his wife, Gina. They lived in Astoria, Queens until early 1954, when they moved to the Cambria Heights section of Queens.  They raised two children, Howard and Eva, in this neighborhood, before relocating in the early 1970's to Forest Hills, Queens.</p><p>Gotfryd joined the staff of Newsweek in 1957, where he worked for more than thirty years.  His photography for Newsweek encompasses a broad sampling of celebrity portraits and events in the U.S. in the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's, including numerous photos in and around New York City.</p><p>It was while working for Newsweek, covering the Holocaust Survivors Gathering in Washington, D.C., in April 1983 that Gotfryd was moved to write about his own experiences. First published in Newsweek, his stories were published in 1990 as a collection, titled <emph render="italic">Anton the Dove Fancier and Other Tales of the Holocaust</emph>.  An expanded edition of the book was published in 2000. In addition the book <emph render="italic">Widuje ich w snach: Nowe Opowiadania</emph> (<emph render="italic">I can see them in my dreams: The new stories</emph>) was published in English and Polish in 2008, and <emph render="italic">Stolarz Isaak, Em Murem</emph> in polish in 2009.  Gotfryd also has given numerous talks to school children and others about his experiences during World War II.</p><p>

Portraits feature actors, artists, athletes, musicians, politicians and writers and include both formal and candid shots. The photographs are arranged alphabetically by name with cross-references when more than one person appears in a single image. A separate folder contains images of musical groups, including The Beatles during an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. </p><p>Subseries II.2 Portraits – Unmounted  – By Other Photographers includes eight portraits taken by Bernard Gotfryd's first cousin, Alex Gotfryd. Also included are two portraits of Bernard Gotfryd, one by his son, Howard Gotfryd, and the other by Richard Reinhold.</p><p>Subseries II.3 Portraits – Mounted contains portraits that are either matted or mounted to board. As with the unmounted portraits, images include both formal and candid portraits of actors, artists, dancers, politicians and writers. </p><p>Subseries II.4 Subjects – Unmounted consists of photographs of places and events, mainly in New York City. Images are arranged alphabetically by topic. Images of art include several photographs of kinetic and light art, taken at the Howard Wise Gallery in 1967. "Buildings - Printing &amp; Publishing" is comprised of photographs taken during the final day of work at the New York Daily Mirror. This series includes images of the presses, the building and many of the workers. Celebrations include two images of a ticker tape parade for astronauts John Young and Virgil Grissom. Also included is a color photograph of fireworks during the Brooklyn Bridge Centennial celebration. "Children" contains several images of children playing on the streets of New York. One image shows a group of small boys with a shoeshine box. Another shows three boys playing cards outside Pennsylvania Station. "Demonstrations &amp; Parades" contains a single image of Legal Aid employees on strike. "Immigration" is a group of images taken at the Calexico-Mexicali border station. The images are undated, but appear to be from the 1960s. Photographs of newspaper vendors, stockbrokers, street artists and vendors are included in "Occupations." A separate folder contains photographs of police officers. New York City street scenes show daily life in the city, including several images of the city at night. Photographs include a father and daughter eating hot dogs from a vendor. Another image shows a crowded Times Square sidewalk, complete with an advertisement for Metropole Café's "Topless Go Go." John F. Kennedy International Airport's Terminal 5 is represented in "Transportation," along with horse-drawn carriages and a solitary woman riding a bus. Subway images include panhandlers, graffiti and stations, as well as a nun sitting in an unidentified station, reading in front of a Levy's bread advertisement. Photographs of the construction of several unidentified housing projects are located in "Miscellaneous &amp; Unidentified."</p><p>Subseries II.5 Subjects – Mounted is comprised of photographs mounted on board. Two of these images were taken at Robert F. Kennedy's funeral in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral and burial in Arlington National Cemetery. </p><p>In some cases photographic prints have attached typewritten notes from the photographer and/or clippings from the magazines where the photos were published.  Often the notes are of a personal nature indicating circumstances of the photo shoot or feelings about the subject.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref716_f74" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries II.1 - Portraits - Unmounted</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref1307_z0h" level="file"><did><unittitle>"A" general -
