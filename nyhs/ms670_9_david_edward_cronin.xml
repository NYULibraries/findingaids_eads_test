The original pages have been inlaid, and Goldsborough added to his narrative in the margins of the oversized pages, often creating two separate narratives on one page. </p><p>Goldsborough's memoirs discuss John Brown's raid, an aborted trip to Baltimore by Lincoln, unrest in Baltimore at the start of the war, Confederate army camp life, activities in MD and VA, truce meetings, and the battle of Gettysburg.</p><p>Also included are numerous newspaper clippings of Civil War reminiscences written by Goldsborough for the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Record</title> [1899-1900], which detail his experiences in 2nd Bull Run, Malvern, Antietam, Gettysburg, and Harper's Ferry, as well as his capture and life as a prisoner at Fort Delaware, Fort Pulaski, and Morris Island. The articles are mounted and annotated by Goldsborough.</p><p>This series also contains portraits of Goldsborough, both sketches and photographs, a photograph of a 2nd Maryland Infantry C.S.A. memorial, and several obituaries of Goldsborough.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref82_uon" level="file"><did><unittitle>W.W.

Letters discuss Cronin's work on <title type="simple" render="italic">Evolution of a Life</title>, the Cavalry Album, <title type="simple" render="italic">The Culprit Fay</title>, his bibliography, Goldsborough's memoirs, and other endeavors, sometimes detailing the lives of particular personages found in his works and reminiscing about his service in the Civil War. A number of letters deal with his relationship with Parish, illuminating aspects of their occasionally contentious patron-artist relationship, especially financial ones. Cronin also muses on the life of the artist in his correspondence.</p><p>Letters to Parish also cover a 1901 journey by Cronin to Virginia, which include observations on the South and racial issues. In addition, a number of letters mention The New-York Historical Society, and its new building on Central Park West.</p><p>This series also contains one folder of correspondence to Cronin from others regarding his work, as well as a few letters from Cronin to others, including one to his sister written from Virginia in August, 1865, and a few letters between others.</p><p>Also included is a number of postcards and photos, mostly of Williamsburg, Va. and some notes of Cronin's (sent to Parish) entitled "Phila. May 13th 1897 Notes of a conversation held between F.A. Whitehead (Lincoln, Del.) And D.E. Cronin at the Reading Terminal Station, between trains, yesterday, May 12th. Submitted to Mr. Parish for his information and guidance in the matter of the regimental history, while reminding him that my motives are personal vindication and self defense." </p></scopecontent><c
