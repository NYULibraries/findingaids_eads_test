    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Ludington Family Papers span several generations but relate chiefly to Lewis Ludington (1786-1857) and his family, in particular, his sons Charles (1825-1910) and James (1827-1891).  Papers include correspondence relating to family and business matters, financial records of the family's assorted business interests, and family portraits and photograph albums. Family members were located in New York City, in Carmel, New York, and in Wisconsin, and their correspondence describes aspects of life in all three locations.</p><p>Of particular interest is a journal kept by Charles Ludington from 1842-1848, documenting his life in New York City, his visits to the family home in Carmel, New York, and his travels west to the family business established in Wisconsin.  The collection also includes printed material and ephemera reflecting Charles' membership and participation in many of New York's leading cultural and civic institutions, in particular those relating to art. The collection includes invitations and tickets to various exhibitions, as well as correspondence between Charles and prominent American artists Sanford Gifford, Jervis McAntee, and Charles Wrey, from whom Charles apparently purchased original works of art. Other highlights include correspondence and ephemera relating to the Civil War and Lincoln's assassination.</p><p>The collection also contains a few business records, including two account books which appear to be from the store Lewis Ludington opened in 1817 with his older brother Frederick.</p><p>More detailed information about the contents will be found in the Scope and Contents notes for each series.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>This is a collection of family papers from the descendants of William Ludington, the patriarch of the Ludington family in America. William Ludington emigrated from England and settled in the Massachusetts Bay colony sometime around 1639. The first family member represented in these papers is Henry Ludington  (1739-1817), who gained some renown for his involvement in the American Revolution. He served as Colonel of the 7th Regiment of the Dutchess County Militia and was aide to Washington at the Battle of White Plains.  He also served as a member of the New York Assembly in the 1770's and 1780's.</p><p>Henry Ludington's oldest daughter, Sybil, also played a role in Revolutionary events, one that earned her fame as a female Paul Revere. According to a 1907 article  by her great-nephew, Connecticut historian Louis S. Patrick, 16-year-old Sybil Ludington rode about forty miles through the night of 26 April 1777 to warn the militiamen under her father's command that the British were burning Danbury, Connecticut. Although Colonel Ludington's troops arrived too late to save Danbury, they fought with British troops as they left the area. After the war, Sybil Ludington married Edward Ogden and they had one child. There is a small amount of material relating to Sybil Ludington and the Ogden family included in the collection.</p><p>The bulk of the collection relates to the family of Lewis Ludington, Henry Ludington's sixth son and youngest child.  Lewis Ludington was born in Fredericksburg, New York, on June 25, 1786. With his brother Frederick, Lewis ran a general store near their home.  He married Polly Townsend and in 1816, they moved to the village of Carmel. Although Carmel remained the family homestead, in the 1830's Lewis and his nephew, Harrison Ludington, bought land in Wisconsin and formed in Milwaukee the general mercantile firm of Ludington, Burchard &amp; Co.  Harvey Burchard, also of Carmel, retired a year or two later, and the firm became Ludington &amp; Company. One of the foremost businesses in Milwaukee, Ludington and Co. also owned docks there, and had lumber mills at Oconto. About 1843, Lewis bought a tract of land in Columbia County, which he subsequently laid out as the town of Columbia. He was prominently involved in the development of the city until his death in 1857.</p><p>Lewis and Polly had nine children.  The most represented in this collection is their fifth child, Charles Ludington. Charles was born at Carmel, New York, on February 1, 1825. In 1842, he became a clerk in a wholesale dry-goods store in New  York, and later was a partner in the firm of Lathrop, Ludington &amp; Company.  One of the leading dry-goods firms of New York, the business was located first on Cortlandt Street, and later on Park Row. Like others in its field, the firm did a considerable amount of business with the Southern states before the Civil War. A strong Union supporter, Charles contributed to recruiting and equipping troops in New York City and Putnam County, but hired a substitute to serve for him as a soldier. He was involved with many civic and cultural institutions in New York throughout his life.</p><p>Charles corresponded frequently with his younger brother, James Ludington. James was born at Carmel on April 18, 1827. In 1843, he went to Milwaukee to work in Ludington and Co., the firm founded by his father, Lewis Ludington. James also aided his father in founding the town of Columbus. He later acquired extensive sawmills on the Pere Marquette River, in Michigan, and founded the town of Ludington there.</p><p>The collection also includes some photograph albums of Charles' son, Charles Henry Ludington, Jr., and his wife Ethel Mildred Saltus.</p><p>More complete family history will be found in the Ludington-Saltus Records volume, which is part of the collection.</p>  </bioghist>

The majority of the letters are to or from Charles Ludington.  Topics include school, travel, and business matters of Charles Ludington's dry goods business in New York City, and of the family lumber business in Milwaukee.</p><p>Notable letters include a description of traveling through Detroit in the 1840's; a description of the Whig parade in New York on October 30, 1844; a letter regretting Henry Clay losing the election of 1844; various letters about Lavinia attending the Rutgers Female Institute; a letter describing the fire at Niblo's Garden in 1846; a description of the funeral of John Quincy Adams in 1848; a rapturous letter about seeing singer Jenny Lind in 1850; and a letter expressing outrage over Lincoln's assassination in 1865.  There are a few letters from James Ludington in the 1860's on the topic of his sister Laura's husband Robert, who was an alcoholic. Most of the later family correspondence is between Charles and James, and deals primarily with business matters.</p><p>In addition to family correspondence, there is a folder of letters from George W. Chapman, agent for Lathrop, Ludington &amp; Co., to Charles Ludington, regarding business and employment matters. There is also one folder of correspondence from various other non-family members, primarily concerning business matters.  Correspondents include Robert Lathrop, Panama Canal promoter Frederick Kelley, and Congressmen Augustus Frank, George W. Patterson, and William Walter Phelps.  </p><p>Two additional folders of correspondence have been organized by topic: "Civil War Correspondence" deals primarily with recruiting efforts in Carmel, New York, which Charles Ludington supported; and "Art Correspondence," which includes letters between Charles Ludington and various artists and art dealers, including Jervis McEntee, Sanford Gifford, and Jacob Wrey Mould.  </p><p>This series also includes a journal kept by Charles Ludington from 1842 to 1847. It includes colorful descriptions of various events in New York City, such as the procession to celebrate completion of the Croton Aqueduct, and gives a real flavor of daily life during that time period.
