The collection includes many letters from Thomas's children, relatives, friends and acquaintances, other doctors, and patients. They pertain to his work as a physician, more particularly as an allergist; his association with St. Luke's Hospital; his interest in genealogy; the authorship of "A Visit from St. Nicholas"; his research for, and publication of his Field book of common mushrooms; a few letters about his service during World War I; membership in numerous historical, medical, and religious organizations; and his interest in the flute.
