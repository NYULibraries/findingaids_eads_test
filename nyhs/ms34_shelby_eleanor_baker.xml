Included are his volunteer enlistment certificate, appointments to sergeant and lieutenant, muster-in roll, and discharge papers. The papers also contain documents created after his service, including a pension certificate issued after his death to his wife, Mariette, and a resolution passed by members of the 136th Regiment requesting the Secretary of the Regimental Association to convey "the assurance of our kind remembrance" to Shelby during his illness. Also included are two obituaries from unidentified newspapers, containing biographical information.</p><p>Folder 2 contains correspondence and notes. This folder primarily contains letters written by George Gletty to Eleanor during their courtship. The letters describe George's love for Eleanor, as well as his daily activities, most notably his attempts to build a house for them. There is also one unaddressed letter of recommendation for George A. Gletty and a letter written to Eleanor shortly after her marriage by her cousin, Mary A. Jones.</p><p>Folder 3 contains the travel diary Eleanor kept during her travels in 1909. Eleanor visited Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, before returning to New York State. Towards the end of the diary are some recipes for butterscotch and chocolate cake.</p><p>Folder 4 contains one photograph each of Shelby and Mariette Baker, as well as five photographs of Eleanor as a child and as an adult.</p>  </scopecontent>
