    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Scovill Manufacturing Company was founded in 1802 and incorporated in 1850. Based principally in Waterbury, Connecticut, the company also had locations in New Haven and in New York City. The company began as a button manufacturer, most notably working with brass. With the emergence of photography in the 1840s, the company expanded into the production of daguerreotype plates and later into cameras. By the time of the records in this collection, the company had established a store in New York City at 419-421 Broome Street for the sale of photographic supplies, which this collection likely relates to. The company still exists, though no longer based in the Northeast nor in the photography business. It is now known as Morito Scovill and has returned to its roots in the business of manufacturing buttons and other forms of fasteners. </p><p>(The above note is based on various on-line sources.)</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection holds 6 volumes of invoices paid by Scovill Manufacturing Company. Though the invoices are not explicit, it seems most likely that these invoices relate to Scovill's store in New York City where photographic supplies such as those invoiced were sold.  The invoices are from manufacturers of photograph supplies (paper, glass plates, cards, etc.), picture frames, cases, hardware items (such as thimbles), druggists/chemists, and other suppliers. The suppliers are predominantly from New York City. Among the many companies represented are A.M. Collins, Son, &amp; Co.; E &amp; H.T. Anthony &amp; Co.; Lewis Pattberg &amp; Bros.; Brown &amp; Brothers; and Phenix Plate Co. There are about 12,600 invoices in the volumes. There are a small number of Scovill-generated invoices in the 1879 and 1880 volumes, which show the company's letterhead and imagery; these seem to be directed to Scovill's New York store for payment of expenses incurred by the Waterbury operation on New York's behalf.</p>  </scopecontent>
