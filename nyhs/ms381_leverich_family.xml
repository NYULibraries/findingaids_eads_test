<p><title type="simple" render="bold">The Leverich Family:</title> </p><p>The Leverich Family is descended from the Rev. William Leverich (ca.1605-1677), who left England for Massachusetts in 1633 and settled in Long Island twenty years later. William Leverich held lands in Oyster Bay, Huntington, and Newtown, New York. His son Caleb (ca.1636-1717) settled permanently in Newtown at the end of the seventeenth century. In the middle third of the 19th century, four of the sons of Colonel Edward Leverich (ca.1761-1833), a descendant of Caleb Leverich, founded Leverich &amp; Co., a merchant house active in New York and New Orleans. </p><p>The Leverich brothers began their mercantile activities in the 1820's. Over the course of the next fifty years, the four brothers, Henry S. Leverich (ca.1806-1885), Charles P. Leverich (1809-1876), William E. Leverich (18xx-18xx), and James H. Leverich (18xx-ca.1840) became successful merchants and bankers in both cities. Henry S. and Charles P. began their careers in New York. Henry was an associate of Peter Remsen &amp; Co., and Charles appears to also have been employed by Remsen &amp; Co., but in a lesser capacity than Henry. James H. and William E. established their own firm in New Orleans. </p><p>Remsen &amp; Co. dealt in a variety of products, including those Southern commodities that Leverich &amp; Co. would come to specialize in trading. Henry S. Leverich appears to have conducted much of this trading in Southern produce while he was associated with Remsen &amp; Co., and on more than one occasion, in the 1820's, visited the Southern States. These visits would have a significant impact on the Leverich family, as well as on the family business. Henry S. and Charles P. Leverich (who also visited the South on several occasions) married, respectively, Margaret and Matilda Gustine, the two eldest daughters of Dr. James Gustine of Natchez, Mississippi. An uncle of the Gustine sisters was Stephen Duncan; a brother-in-law was William J. Minor. Duncan and Minor were two of the richest planters in the United States. Leverich &amp; Co. would act as factors (i.e. agents) for both of these planters throughout the antebellum period. Thus, two of the most important clients of the Leverich brothers were also relatives by marriage. </p><p>Henry S. Leverich and Margaret Gustine Leverich had two children, Edward and Mary. Charles P. Leverich and Matilda Gustine Leverich had four children, Charles D., Stephen D., James H. and Matilda R. In 1872 Edward Leverich, the son of Henry S. Leverich, married Annie Schuchardt. Edward and Annie had three children: Margaret D., Catherine S., and Henry S. Leverich. </p><p><title type="simple" render="bold">Leverich &amp; Co.:</title> </p><p>The name Leverich and Co. first appears in the 1820's with reference to the business of William E. and James H. Leverich, in New Orleans. With the dissolution of Peter Remsen &amp; Co. in May of 1835, Henry S. Leverich continued to operate as a commission merchant, dealing with many of the same clients and associates that he had done business with during his tenure at Remsen &amp; Co. During this period, Henry's brother Charles became his partner, and the two brothers in New York also began to call their firm Leverich &amp; Co. </p><p>Initially, Leverich &amp; Co. dealt in the products that commission merchants regularly dealt in during the 19th century. These included household products such as tobacco, foodstuffs, spices, glass and glassware, and soap. Leverich &amp; Co. also dealt in industrial products such as hemp, hides, and bulk chemicals, specifically brimstone, saltpeter and indigo. A large proportion of the firm's business in its early years entailed the import of wine and its reshipment to other ports in the U.S. In this early period, most of Leverich &amp; Co.'s bulk trade in Southern produce was in sugar and sugar products, i.e. molasses and rum. </p><p>The firm's business had two distinct but related components; the first was its activity as commission merchants. In this capacity, the firm arranged the import and export of goods between the United States and Europe, and the shipment from New York of domestically produced goods to other ports within the United States. The second component was its activity as cotton factors. In this capacity, the firm arranged the shipment and sale of Southern agricultural products to purchasers in the Northern states and in Europe, and in turn acted as purchasing agent for its clientele of Southern planters, filling their orders for manufactured or luxury goods. Leverich &amp; Co. is listed in city directories of the period under "cotton factors", but in practice the firm dealt in all the produce of Southern plantation agriculture, including cotton, sugar, molasses, rice, and occasionally tobacco. It purchased on order for its clients a variety of manufactured goods, from furniture to kid gloves to heavy machinery. </p><p>Leverich &amp; Co. also provided financial services, investing money in the stock market on its clients' behalf. Charles P. Leverich was particularly active in financial affairs in New York City. Charles was associated with the Bank of New York, becoming a Director in 1840, Vice-president in 1853, and President in 1863. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, he served on the first loan committee formed by associated banks to lend money to the Administration for the prosecution of the war. He continued throughout the war to be active in financial matters related to the war effort. </p><p>From the period 1835-1860, Leverich &amp; Co. prospered. However, since the firm dealt extensively in Southern products, the Civil War significantly affected its business. The end of the war brought comparatively rapid economic recovery, and the firm reestablished its Southern connections, primarily in New Orleans and in Winnsboro, South Carolina. Leverich &amp; Co.'s Southern counterpart, usually called J. H. Leverich &amp; Co., does not seem to have recovered its separate identity. James H. Leverich died ca.1840. William E. Leverich, that firm's surviving member, appears to have been an employee of Leverich &amp; Co. in the years after the war, rather than a partner in his own right.</p><p>By the late 1860's, Edward Leverich (son of Henry S. Leverich) and his cousin, Charles D. Leverich (son of Charles P. Leverich) were Henry S. Leverich's partners in Leverich &amp; Co. Henry S. Leverich seems over the next ten years to have become less and less active in the day-to-day affairs of the company. During this decade, the firm concentrated primarily on the cotton business, with William E. Leverich overseeing the firm's affairs in New Orleans. Leverich &amp; Co.'s cotton trading in the late 1860's and 1870's appears to have been robust, and the firm seems to have enjoyed considerable prestige in the cotton industry. In 1879, however, the firm went into liquidation, and Edward Leverich, at least, appears to have been heavily in debt; whether the debt was the cause or the effect of the dissolution of Leverich &amp; Co. is unclear. </p><p><title type="simple" render="bold">Oak Lawn and Dogberry:</title> </p><p>One of Leverich &amp; Co.'s Southern clients was Dr. James Porter, of Oak Lawn, a plantation in Bayou Teche, Louisiana. After Porter's death in 1849, his widow, Mary (Walton) Porter, continued as a client of the firm. Mrs. Porter was a Unionist during the Civil War. She and her daughters, Annie and Mary, lived at their summer home in Newport, Rhode Island during the War. Mrs. Porter retained Leverich &amp; Co.'s services throughout this period. </p><p>The war appears to have adversely affected the Porter's fortunes. In the years immediately following the war, Leverich &amp; Co. apparently held the mortgage to Oak Lawn, and seems to have had effective control of the plantation, even though the Porters retained legal title to it. Mrs. Porter appears to have died by the 1870's. </p><p>In 1873, Leverich &amp; Co. purchased Oak Lawn and Dogberry, a smaller neighboring plantation also owned by Mrs. Porter. Leverich &amp; Co. forgave the debt that Mary Porter's surviving daughters, Annie and Mary, owed to the firm in exchange for title to the properties. Annie and Mary Porter were permitted to reside at Oak Lawn until such time as the property was sold. After Leverich &amp; Co. went into liquidation, Annie and Mary Porter were still living at Oak Lawn, and they seem to have regained control of the properties. </p><p>In early 1881, however, two years after Leverich &amp; Co. went into liquidation, Edward Leverich began taking steps to purchase the plantation in the name of his wife, Annie (Schuchardt) Leverich. Edward may have gone to Louisiana to negotiate the purchase personally, and he appears to have purchased it from the Porters, rather than from Leverich &amp; Co. or its creditors. While his wife remained in New York, Edward Leverich took possession of Oak Lawn in December of 1881.</p><p>Edward faced a daunting task in attempting to rehabilitate the plantation, which had fallen into a state of disrepair over the years. In addition to repairs to the residence itself, Edward had to upgrade the plant of Oak Lawn; this entailed the purchase of farm implements, barbed wire, machinery, and livestock. The initial outlay of money was very large, and many of the plantation's improvements were financed with credit, provided mostly by Edward's cousin Abe Leverich, a New Orleans commission merchant. </p><p>Throughout their ownership of Oak Lawn, the Leveriches would be plagued by financial problems. On more than one occasion, Edward found himself having to borrow money from his father, Henry S. Leverich, while at the same time concealing from Henry the desperation of his financial situation. Edward was also indebted from time to time to his father-in-law, Frederick Schuchardt (1805-1885). Schuchardt, however, unlike Henry S. Leverich, seems to have been more inclined to personally scrutinize Edward's management of the plantation. </p><p>In addition to his financial troubles, Edward Leverich had to cope with a variety of problems. In 1882, and again in 1883, Oak Lawn's levee broke, flooding much of the plantation's arable land. The machinery at the plantation's sugar house often broke down, causing temporary halts in production. Bad weather killed or damaged crops. </p><p>By the time the 1885 planting season was beginning, however, things began to look more promising for Edward. At around this time, Edward Leverich made an agreement with the Burdon Central Sugar Refining Company. Burdon Central would build a refinery on Bayou Teche, in the vicinity of Oak Lawn. In return, Burdon Central would have exclusive right to refine Edward's crops for 1886, 1887, and 1888. </p><p>Edward Leverich died November 28, 1886. Upon his death, his wife Annie assumed control of the plantation. Annie appears to have reneged on the agreement with Burdon Central, and instead had the crop refined by a different firm in 1887 and 1888. This apparent breach of contract resulted in a lawsuit by Burdon Central against Annie Leverich. Annie counter-sued, on the grounds that the 1886 crop, which had been refined by Burdon Central, had been incompetently handled. </p><p>Annie Leverich was unable to maintain Oak Lawn. By December of 1887, she determined to sell the plantation, and, with the lawsuits ongoing, found a buyer. Col. R. E. Rivers, proprietor of the St. Charles Hotel in New Orleans, purchased the plantation in March of 1888. Annie moved to Pass Christian, Mississippi in the summer of 1888. She spent the next several years corresponding with her creditors. </p><p>Within this collection, Annie Leverich leaves little record of herself after 1890. Other sources reveal that by 1896, she had returned to New York, and from 1896 to 1908 lived on E. 60th St. In 1908, she moved to Throg's Neck, in the Bronx. The last entry for her in the Social Register is in the Summer 1915 edition. </p>  </bioghist>

  <dsc><c id="aspace_ref13_052" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series I: Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1825-1890, 1937</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_60e2a6d4669ed5ab221a4158a0332bd3"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>The Correspondence series consists of letters, telegrams, letterpress books, letter copy books, code books, annotated bills, annotated statements, annotated prices current, invitations, calling cards, envelopes, and an address book. The series primarily contains correspondence to and from members of the Leverich and allied families, the family business, Leverich &amp; Co., and business associates of both the family and the firm. The series includes information about Leverich &amp; Co.'s business dealings, the running of the Oak Lawn and Dogberry plantations, and to a lesser degree the family and private matters of the Leveriches. The material in this series dates from 1825 to 1890, with a selection of handwritten notes from 1937. The bulk dates vary with the least amount of material existing for the years of the Civil War. </p><p>The principal subseries contain correspondence of Leverich &amp; Co., Charles P. Leverich, Henry S. Leverich, Edward Leverich, Annie Leverich, and family friend and employee George Payne. Each of the principal subseries is further divided into incoming and outgoing material. Incoming ("Received") correspondence consists of letters, telegrams and annotated items addressed to the above-named persons or entities. Outgoing ("Sent") correspondence consists of letter books (retained copies of letters sent), telegram books, and a small number of letters sent by them to other addressees.</p><p>Foldered material is arranged alphabetically by the sender's name, and then chronologically within the folder. For purposes of arrangement, the "sender" is the person or entity noted (docketed) by the recipient on the verso of the letter. Thus, a letter signed by "John Smith", but docketed "Smith &amp; Jones" would be filed under "Smith &amp; Jones". A letter signed by the same individual, but docketed "John Smith" would be filed as "Smith, John". Within the subseries, folders were created for correspondents who authored ten or more documents and for noteworthy persons within the collection, such as other Leverich family members and members of the Porter family, owners of the Oak Lawn and Dogberry plantations. Persons or entities that created fewer than ten documents are included in general alphabetical folders located at the beginning of each subseries.</p><p>Researchers should note that, for the most part, envelopes are housed with their corresponding letters. However, the Envelopes subseries contains a few folders of envelopes for which the corresponding letter could not be readily determined.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref14_gt8" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 1: Leverich &amp; Co. </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1838-1880</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cb1c89ad873eda36fa4ceff1706ec855"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>The largest single subseries in the Correspondence series is of material pertaining to Leverich &amp; Co. The inclusive dates of this sub-series are 1838 to 1880; the bulk dates are 1868 to 1878. In addition to the loose material, there are three letter books, two telegram books, and two telegraphic code books kept by the firm. The letter books date from 1838 to 1841, 1870 to 1876, and 1873 to 1874. The telegram books date from 1873 to 1876. </p><p>Leverich &amp; Co did business with firms throughout the United States as well as with foreign firms. While most of the firm's dealings were in cotton, Leverich &amp; Co. dealt in a variety of commodities and had diverse commercial interests. Correspondence with W. C. Kennett &amp; Co. of St. Louis concerns the purchase and shipment of grain and meal; the correspondence of Price, Hine &amp; Tupper of New Orleans concerns the sugar trade. Internationally, the firm corresponded with A. Le Forestier &amp; Fils of Havre about the purchase of wine, and with Chapman, Fraser &amp; Tylee, of Montreal, about the consignment of wine to that firm. Letters from the banking house of Pike, Lapeyre, &amp; Brother, of New Orleans, deal with financial matters. The foregoing material dates from the late 1860's and early 1870's. Letters from Tallant &amp; Co. of San Francisco, from the late 1870's, document Leverich &amp; Co.'s interests in gold and silver mines in California and Nevada. In addition, Leverich &amp; Co. did business with a large number of commission houses, banks, and retail firms throughout the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, as well as in the Northeast. </p><p>Most of the material in the subseries concerns the post-bellum cotton business in New York and in the South, particularly Winnsboro, South Carolina, Norfolk, Virginia, and New Orleans. The principal correspondents in Winnsboro are James Aiken, H. L. Elliott, and James Chapman. The principal correspondents in New Orleans are William E. Leverich, brother of Henry S. and Charles P. Leverich, and J. T. Doswell. R. M. Doswell addresses correspondence from both New Orleans and Norfolk. Other correspondents include Henry Cobia and Lesesne &amp; Wells, of Charleston, South Carolina, Duff Green &amp; Son of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and George T. Rogers &amp; Sons of Macon, Georgia. Specific subjects include weather conditions, overseas and domestic markets, prices, and credit. William E. Leverich's correspondence of the 1870's includes discussions of the Oak Lawn plantation and the Porters. Material from George Green &amp; Son of Liverpool involves the cotton trade in Great Britain. </p><p>The earlier letter book of Leverich &amp; Co. dates from 1838 to 1841. This particular volume is attributed to Leverich &amp; Co., rather than to a specific partner, because both Henry S. and Charles P. Leverich used it; letter books used by only one partner are attributed to that partner only. Most of the letters in the volume are to persons or firms in New Orleans. These include: J.H. Leverich &amp; Co., a firm founded by James H. Leverich, a brother of Henry S. and Charles P. Leverich; William E. Leverich; Carriere, Darant &amp; Co.; James Colles; Georges Legendere; and T.R. Hyde &amp; Co. Frequent correspondents in other cities include Edward Dawson of Mobile, and Jackson &amp; Todd of Philadelphia. Most of this material has to do with the sugar or cotton trades. </p><p>The later letter books and the telegram books date from the 1870's. One of the letter books contains, in its entirety, letters to James Aiken. This volume is chiefly written in the hands of Edward Leverich, son of Henry Leverich, and Charles D. Leverich, son of Charles P. Leverich, and deals with cotton purchases and prices, and credit. The other later letter book is a letterpress book of bills. The telegram books contain messages to a variety of recipients, including James Aiken and H.L. Elliott. These are usually buy or sell orders, or price quotations. The 1875-1876 volume appears to contain some entries that may not be actual messages, but records of transactions that were simply entered in this particular volume. Two code books for deciphering transcripted messages are also included in this subseries. </p><p>The overwhelming majority of the material in the Leverich &amp; Co. sub-series dates from the Reconstruction period, and some correspondents refer to political events, especially in the South. James Aiken provided information on elections, race relations, and public opinion in Winnsboro. William E. Leverich provided the same type of information regarding New Orleans, including a description of the White League uprising in New Orleans in September 1874. Thomas J. Foster, an employee of Leverich &amp; Co., described a racial disturbance in St. Mary's Parish that took place during the same month. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref15_677"

Leverich are 1829 to 1874. Most of the correspondents are southern businessmen or planters and business affairs play prominently in their letters. Correspondents include A. McWilliams, who wrote from Camperdown, a plantation in Louisiana, and A. D. Shepard of Franklin, Louisiana. Both of these men wrote mainly about sugar and cotton. C. A. F. Rondeau, of New Orleans, wrote on behalf of the Louisiana State Bank. Letters from William E. Leverich of New Orleans have to do with Leverich &amp; Co.'s Louisiana interests in general. Letters from clients of Charles P. Leverich, in his capacity as a cotton factor, include those from Stephen Duncan of Natchez, Mississippi, and William J. Minor, also of Natchez. </p><p>Charles P. Leverich's answers to some of this correspondence can be found in his letter books, which date from 1839 to 1844, 1841 to 1845, and 1853 to 1854. In the letter books, he concerns himself primarily with financial affairs and international trade, and only to a lesser extent addresses specific dealings in Southern commodities. Much of the unbound material addressed to Charles P. Leverich dates from the period 1860-1868; his letter books date from an earlier period. Thus, the persons and firms represented in the letter books are not always the same as those represented in the loose correspondence. Persons who appear frequently in the letter books are L. Millandon, J.H. Leverich and P.J. Palfrey of New Orleans, John S. Riddle and Charles P. Relf of Philadelphia, and Newton Mercer of Natchez. </p><p>Virtually every Southern correspondent of Charles P. Leverich commented on the political events of 1860-1861. The majority of material in the Leverich Papers concerning the election of Abraham Lincoln and the Secession Crisis is in this subseries. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref181_2vc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letters received: A - M</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1839/1871" type="inclusive">1839, 1857-1867, 1870-1871, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_73c0756083b1fc1f8d39dda30a471165" label="Mixed Materials [10170000021281]" type="Offsite-Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_73c0756083b1fc1f8d39dda30a471165" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref182_9ju" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letters received: N - Z</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1858/1872" type="inclusive">1858-1861, 1865, 1872</unitdate><container id="aspace_1fd42c09eea6f3a847bd424123a4c9fe" label="Mixed Materials [10170000021281]" type="Offsite-Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_1fd42c09eea6f3a847bd424123a4c9fe" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref183_2qd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letters received: Duncan, S.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1858/1858" type="inclusive">1858</unitdate><container id="aspace_a562eb1eb58c29e55eda918f44c23e03" label="Mixed Materials [10170000021281]" type="Offsite-Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_a562eb1eb58c29e55eda918f44c23e03" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref184_zz6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letters received: Duncan, S.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1859/1859" type="inclusive">1859</unitdate><container id="aspace_7af1c762cbe55f7b22c0d57e4176b6fb" label="Mixed Materials [10170000021281]" type="Offsite-Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_7af1c762cbe55f7b22c0d57e4176b6fb" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref185_lgv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letters received: Leverich.

Leverich, the other principal partner in Leverich &amp; Co. The inclusive dates for this material are 1824 to 1877. Almost all the letters in the collection from before 1840 are addressed to Henry S. Leverich, as opposed to Leverich &amp; Co. Correspondents include James Colles and Joseph Lallande, both of New Orleans, who wrote about the sugar trade in the 1820's. Peters and Millard, also of that city, concerned themselves mostly with financial matters during the following decade. The sub-series also contains correspondence from W. &amp; J.H. Leverich, Leverich &amp; Co.'s New Orleans counterpart. Henry S. Leverich's responses to the letters of W. &amp; J.H. Leverich are usually addressed to one or the other of the partners in that firm, rather than to the firm as such. Most of this material is from the 1820's and 1830's. J. Oliviera &amp; Co. of London and Madeira corresponded with Henry S. Leverich during the 1830's regarding the wine trade. Tallant &amp; Co., in the 1870's, apprized Henry S. Leverich of the status of his stock holdings in the Western United States. Letters from other correspondents dealt with a range of mercantile pursuits. Foldered with the correspondence is a small travel diary of Henry's voyage to New Orleans on the ship Frances Fosdick, in 1826 and a one-page journal of the ship Huntsville in 1836.</p><p>The nine letter books of Henry S. Leverich date from 1824 to 1849, with a gap between 1836 and 1838. One of the letter books is blank. Almost all of this material has to do with specific transactions in cotton, molasses, sugar, rice, tobacco or coffee. Of particular note, however, are Henry Leverich's letters from the Southern States to his brother Charles in the mid-1820's; his observations to Oliviera &amp; Co. on the Oregon Boundary dispute, the Mexican-American War, and the tariff; and his close monitoring of the rice market during the European potato blight of 1847.

Edward Leverich's letter books date from 1878 to 1887, for a total of five volumes. Most of the material from the period 1870 to 1880 concerns Edward Leverich's activities as a partner in Leverich &amp; Co., including that company's liquidation in the period 1879-1880. The material from the period after 1880 pertains primarily to the management of the Oak Lawn and Dogberry Plantations, which Edward and Annie Leverich purchased in early 1881, and to the disposition of those plantations' sugar crops. Principal correspondents are Foster &amp; Levy, the firm that managed the plantations, John Calder of the refining firm of Calder &amp; Creevy, L.M. Ferris of the Burdon Central Sugar Refining Company, and George Payne. In large part, the letter books contain Edward's letters to Annie Leverich, written when he was at Oak Lawn and she was in New York. Most of Edward's letters to his wife detail the day-to-day running of the plantations, including weather conditions and flooding, as well as the purchase of farm implements, feed, and household items. The correspondence also deals with matters regarding Oak Lawn's employees, such as the shooting of a Chinese laborer in 1883, and with domestic disputes among the tenants. Edward Leverich also wrote about his financial circumstances in letters to his father, Henry S. Leverich, and to his father-in-law, Frederick Schuchardt. </p><p>The subseries includes other correspondence to and from individuals and companies, mostly in New Orleans and vicinity. The most important of these is Abe Leverich, Edward's cousin, who acted as factor for him in New Orleans. Much of the correspondence with Abe Leverich concerns purchases of supplies for the plantation and loans for its short-term maintenance. Correspondence with Leeds &amp; Co., of New Orleans, from whom Edward Leverich ordered spare parts for his sugar refining equipment, sometimes contain drawings made by him for custom components. Edward Leverich also wrote frequently to Murphy J. Foster, an attorney, about the legal affairs attendant to running the plantation. Later correspondence includes letters to and from James Platt of New York, regarding the estate of Frederick Schuchardt, Annie Leverich's father. After Edward's death in November 1886, the final letter book was taken over by his wife, Annie.

During her husband Edward's lifetime, the letters in her letter books are primarily to him and deal largely with family matters; other letters record her relationship with long-time family friend George Payne and her dealings with merchants. After Edward's death, the correspondence of Annie Leverich deals in large part with the management of the Oak Lawn and Dogberry Plantations. Annie Leverich sold Oak Lawn and Dogberry in 1888, and some of the correspondence from that and the previous year deals with the sale of the property. Much of the later correspondence (1888-1890) deals with a lawsuit brought against Mrs. Leverich by the Burdon Central Sugar Refining Company, and with Mrs. Leverich's countersuit. Principal correspondents are L. Murray Ferris of the Burdon Central Sugar Refining Company, and the law firms of Foster &amp; Mentz and Rouse &amp; Grant of New Orleans, and Glover, Sweezy &amp; Glover of New York. Correspondence with the real estate and insurance firm of Seton &amp; Wissman, of New York, and with Frank deR. Wissman, documents Annie Leverich's business holdings in that city. Letters to relatives include those to Fred Schuchardt, her [nephew], and Ferdinand Schuchardt, her [cousin]. She continued the business relationship that her husband had had with Abe Leverich, even after the sale of Oak Lawn. </p><p>All of the above-named persons are represented in Annie Leverich's letter books. Aside from family matters and her legal affairs, and the operation of the plantation, Annie Leverich's letter books contain material regarding her ultimate sale of Oak Lawn, including an inventory of the property and letters to prospective buyers. After her sale of Oak Lawn, Annie Leverich moved to Pass Christian, Mississippi. Her later letter books were created there, and much of her correspondence from this period concerns her ongoing legal dispute with the Burdon Central Sugar Refining Company.

The material dates from 1866-1890. Letters to Payne are mainly from Annie Leverich, written when she was absent from Oak Lawn, and from A.R. Stirling, manager of the Oak Lawn store. These letters have to do primarily with the management of Oak Lawn and Dogberry, and the lawsuit arising from the dispute between Annie Leverich and Burdon Central Sugar Refining. An unbound letterpress book contains letters from George Payne to Annie Leverich (whom he addressed as "Sunflower"), written when Annie was absent from the plantation in 1887. In addition to the correspondence in his own letter book, some letters written by George Payne appear in Annie Leverich's letter books. </p><p>George Payne's association with the Leverich Family spanned approximately thirty years; during this period, he wrote to Leverich &amp; Co., Charles P. Leverich, and Henry S. Leverich, in addition to Edward Leverich and Annie Leverich. Letters from George Payne appear in each of these subseries. Payne was involved with the management of Oak Lawn and Dogberry, and this involvement comprises a great deal of the subject matter of his letters to Annie Leverich. Many of his letters to Edward Leverich pertain to a suit that Payne brought before the U.S. Court of Claims.

Included here are four letters to Peter Remsen and Co., and two letters from Peter Remsen and Co., announcing its dissolution in 1835. </p><p>Also included in this subseries is an unbound letter book of Frederick Schuchardt, father of Annie Leverich. Schuchardt accompanied Edward and Annie Leverich to Oak Lawn when the Leveriches took possession of the plantation in December of 1881 and remained with them until February 1882. From Oak Lawn, he wrote to his daughters Amelia and Lizzie [Delafield?], his [nephew] Ferdinand, and to several business associates. In his letters, Frederick Schuchardt describes the plantation, his daily activities, especially hunting, and writes extensively on the subject of dog breeding. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref318_idx" level="file"><did><unittitle>A - L</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1818/1889" type="inclusive">1818, 1827-1839, 1848-1889</unitdate><container id="aspace_729f937329e26dd7d1c57b8a02ce0186" label="Mixed Materials [10170000021288]" type="Offsite-Box">18</container><container parent="aspace_729f937329e26dd7d1c57b8a02ce0186" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref319_i97" level="file"><did><unittitle>M - Z</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1829/1889" type="inclusive">1829-1889, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_696bf65a5c716dbcf4378c1397238425" label="Mixed Materials [10170000021288]" type="Offsite-Box">18</container><container parent="aspace_696bf65a5c716dbcf4378c1397238425" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref320_tys" level="file"><did><unittitle>Frederick Schuchardt: Letter Press Book</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1881/1882" type="inclusive">1881-1882</unitdate><container id="aspace_7e0e659db78d73732f50b25ebac18da4" label="Mixed Materials [10170000021288]" type="Offsite-Box">18</container><container parent="aspace_7e0e659db78d73732f50b25ebac18da4" type="Folder">8</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref322_gql" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 8: Newtown &amp; Bushwick Turnpike </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1831-1844</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ca23568cb447fb4d7c037834abde22d3"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This subseries includes documents relating to the Newtown &amp; Bushwick Turnpike dating from 1831 to 1844.

The collection documents the trade in a wide variety of products, but is particularly rich in material pertaining to the trade in the products of Southern agriculture before and after the Civil War. The material spans the period from 1825 to 1890, with one item from 1818. Henry S. Leverich, one of the partners in Leverich &amp; Co., was an associate of Peter Remsen &amp; Co. from ca. 1825 to Remsen &amp; Co.'s dissolution in May 1835. Thus, most of the material from before May 1835 pertains to Remsen &amp; Co. </p><p>The series is divided into several subseries on the basis of form. Foldered material is arranged chronologically by month within the subseries, based on the latest date on the document. Bound volumes are arranged chronologically, unless otherwise noted. Researchers should be able to access information via various subseries, following a transaction from account books, through invoices and receipts, through bills of lading, etc. </p><p>Very little of the material in this series was in original order, and that which was dates from before 1840. In those cases where original order was evident, it was retained. This material was originally broken down into such categories as "Petty Bills", "Bills of Lading Inward", and "Invoices Inward". It appears to have originally been tied together in bundles, which were identified with a wood or paper placard at the top of the bundle. In these cases, where the material was assigned a title by its creator, the title appears in quotation marks beneath the series title on the folder. The original order material can be found at the beginning of the Bills, Receipts, Invoices, Transferable Orders for Cotton, Payrolls, Charges; Accounts, Statements, Tabulations, Trial Balances; and Bills of Lading/Freight Receipts subseries. It is arranged chronologically by the date appearing in the title. </p><p>Early on Leverich &amp; Co. dealt in household products such as tobacco, foodstuffs, spices, glass and glassware, and soap and also industrial products such as hemp, hides, and bulk chemicals, specifically brimstone, saltpeter and indigo. A large proportion of the firm's business in its early years entailed the import of wine from Palermo, Lisbon, and Madeira, and its reshipment to other ports in the U.S. The most noteworthy associated firm in the wine trade was J. Oliviera &amp; Co. of Madeira and London. Leverich &amp; Co. enjoyed a long relationship with this firm. In this early period, most of Leverich &amp; Co.'s bulk trade in Southern produce was in sugar and sugar products, i.e. molasses and rum. The source of these products was New Orleans, and the shipments usually originated with William E. &amp; James H. Leverich, James Colles &amp; Co., or Joseph Lallande &amp; Co., all of that city. At this time, Leverich &amp; Co. had dealings with a great number of wholesalers and shippers in, as well as the above-named cities, Naples, Bristol, Liverpool, Hamburg, and Antwerp in Europe, and Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston in the United States. Other shipments came from and went to cities as far afield as Calcutta and Buenos Aires. </p><p>Gradually, in the decade after the dissolution of Remsen &amp; Co. in 1835, Leverich &amp; Co. expanded its dealings in Southern products. In addition to sugar, the firm began to deal in cotton and rice, with shipments of these latter products often originating in Charleston, South Carolina. Beginning at this time, Leverich &amp; Co. began its association with James Chapman of Charleston. This relationship endured until the 1870's. Another important associate in the South Carolina trade during the antebellum period was Michael Lazarus. </p><p>Natchez, Mississippi provided another source of cotton. Natchez was the home of Dr. James A. Gustine, Stephen Duncan, and William D. Minor; Leverich &amp; Co. acted as the factors for these three planters, arranging the sale of their produce and filling their orders for supplies. Leverich &amp; Co. expanded its Southern trade throughout the 1840's. </p><p>Throughout the collection, beginning primarily in the 1840's, are numerous bills and receipts from New York retail stores, reflecting not only purchases for the households of Charles P. and Henry S. Leverich, but the purchases of Leverich &amp; Co. for its Southern clients. Indeed, when the Gustine Family relocated to New York after the death of James Gustine, Leverich &amp; Co. continued to act as agent for the family, arranging its household as well as its business affairs. Among the retail firms with whom Leverich &amp; Co. had dealings are Brooks Brothers, Tiffany &amp; Co., and Macy's. Scores of other retailers are represented in the collection. </p><p>Leverich &amp; Co. continued as a commission merchant house until the Civil War. Since the firm dealt extensively in Southern products, the war significantly affected its business. This effect is reflected in the scarcity of business material from the years 1861-1865. It is worth noting, however, that the firm was able to take advantage of the ebbing of Confederate fortunes. In April of 1862, the Union Army occupied New Orleans; by the summer of that year, Leverich &amp; Co. was receiving sugar from that city. Numerous bills from the firms of Dunne &amp; Eagan and Robert Dillon &amp; Co. for the mending of cotton, and from Ford's Stores for the storage of cotton indicate that as the war went on, the firm also received that commodity. From the extant papers, Leverich &amp; Co. does not seem to have done the volume of business during the war that it did before and after it, but it did engage in both domestic and international trade. </p><p>Beginning in the 1850's, Leverich &amp; Co. began undertaking other commercial ventures which may have softened the impact of the war on the principal source of the firm's livelihood. During this period, Leverich &amp; Co. began dealing in "negotiable business paper". Most of the firm's transactions in negotiable paper were with Marshall Pepoon, Cammann &amp; Co., and Francis Skiddy &amp; Co. All of these companies were located on Wall Street in New York City. During the same decade, Leverich &amp; Co. began to purchase stocks and bonds, both for itself and for its clients. Most of the stocks purchased in the 1840's and 1850's were of railroad companies. By the 1870's, Leverich &amp; Co. also owned stock in gold and silver mines in California and Nevada. </p><p>After the Civil War, the mercantile activities of Leverich &amp; Co. began to center almost exclusively on trading in cotton. The post-bellum cotton trade was considerably different from the trade as it had been practiced before the war. In the late 1860's and 1870's, Leverich &amp; Co., for the most part, ceased to be factors for specific planters and began to purchase cotton from merchants in Southern cities, principally Winnsboro, South Carolina, Norfolk, Virginia, and New Orleans. The firm also traded cotton with other brokers in New York City. This emphasis on the cotton trade in the period after the Civil War is reflected in the volume of material from the 1870's. Almost one half of the material in the sub-series Bills, Receipts, Invoices, Transferable Orders for Cotton, Payrolls, Charges is from that decade. The bulk of this material has to do with the cotton trade. This material documents transactions between Leverich &amp; Co. and a large number of other New York cotton brokers. Prominent among the other firms represented are Walter T. Miller &amp; Co. and Brodie &amp; Dubrow. Forms include Classifications, Contracts, and Transferable Orders for Cotton. </p><p>Leverich &amp; Co. went into liquidation in 1879. The bulk of the material from 1880 to 1890 concerns the management of the Oak Lawn and Dogberry Plantations in Bayou Teche, Louisiana. The plantations had been owned by James Porter, for whom Leverich &amp; Co. had acted as factors. By 1873, Leverich &amp; Co. held the mortgages to both plantations, and in 1881 Edward Leverich and his wife Annie purchased them outright. The main crop of Oak Lawn and Dogberry was sugar, and much of the material involves its cultivation and processing. Other items record the workings and expenses of the plantation store, and purchases by and sales to tenants. Of particular note are the payrolls of the plantations, which record a large contingent of Chinese laborers in the plantations' workforce (see Subseries 2, Box 33, Folder 4). The last dated folder in the series contains material from 1890. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref337_hsj" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 1: Account Books </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1818, 1827-1890</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f983c40d1278500a6d2abae871b11431"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Includes journals, ledgers, daybooks, waste books, cash books, sales books, receipt books, record books, invoice books, memorandum books, storage books, cartage books, cotton broker books, and inventories.

The utility of integrating these forms in a single series is that the same document may at different times have served more than one function: an itemized list of goods may have, at the bottom of the sheet, a request for remittance, and below the request, written at a later date, the notation "Recd. Payment". Such an item would have been created as an invoice, submitted as a bill, and been returned to the debtor as a receipt after the creditor had received payment. This section includes bills, receipts (acknowledgments of payment), and invoices paid by Leverich &amp; Co. in its own right as well as bills paid by the firm on behalf of its clients. It also includes household bills of the various Leverich households. Transferable Orders for Cotton are orders to one firm to deliver cotton at a given date at a given price. Charges are costs associated with specific shipments of goods.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref455_gfz" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Bills, Receipts, Invoices: "Bills

The material is arranged by subject and then chronologically within folders. Some of the earliest material in this series relates to the Estate of Jesse Leverich (probably Col. Edward Leverich's brother), Newtown, New York and dates from the 1820's to the 1840's. These documents detail the estate's finances and land holdings. There is also some genealogical information contained in this material. </p><p>The "General" folder includes legal documents from Leverich and non-Leverich Family members. Notable non-Leverich Family members include the Porter, Gustine, and Schuchardt families. The materials in the "General" folder span the years 1830-1889, with a single item dating from 1817. These documents consist of power of attorney forms, contracts, wills, articles of association, articles of incorporation, and other legal materials. Of special interest is the last will and testament of James Porter, 1848, owner of the Oak Lawn Plantation. Included in this folder is an "Abstract of Title to the Homestead of Late Henry S. Leverich at Newtown, Queens County, Long Island," ca. 1885. There are also arbitration documents from the 1860's and 1870's for the New York Cotton Exchange. </p><p>Much of the legal material relating to the Oak Lawn Plantation dates from the 1870's and 1880's and deals with two lawsuits involving Annie F. Leverich. Following the death of her husband Edward Leverich in 1886, Annie Leverich became involved in legal suits with the Burdon Central Sugar Refinery. At issue was Annie Leverich's contractual obligation to provide the refinery with Oak Lawn's crops from the years 1886 to 1889. The first case, Henry J. Davison v. Mrs. Annie F. Leverich, 1887, alleges Annie's failure to meet the requirements of the contract. In 1888, Annie Leverich countersues Mr. Davison's company, The Burdon Central Sugar Refinery, for negligence in the handling of the sugar cane that she had supplied to them in 1886. The trial transcripts, depositions, and notes of Annie Leverich and her confidante George Payne, provide insight into the management of the plantation in the years following the Civil War and the legal status of women as property owners at that time. </p><p>Other items of note relating to Oak Lawn include announcements advertising the sale of the plantation in 1888; inventories of the contents of the house; and promissory notes related to tenants and the hiring of workers. Among the Oak Lawn material can be found maps and drawings of the Oak Lawn and Dogberry plantations and their surrounding areas. The drawings include layout of crops. </p><p>Taxation materials also make up a part of this series, these include property and utility tax documents, 1838-1886 non-inclusive, the bulk of which are for properties in New York; business permits from the U.S. Internal Revenue Collectors Office, 1863-1868; and customs forms, 1835-1838. </p><p>Materials relating to insurance and insurance policies, 1854-1875, can also be found in this series.
