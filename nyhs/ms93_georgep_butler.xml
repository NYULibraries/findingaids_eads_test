<p>George Prentiss Butler was born February 13, 1863, in New York City, the son of Mary Marshall Butler and William Allen Butler. He graduated from Princeton University in 1884 and married Ellen Mudge of Yonkers in 1886, where they continued to reside.  In 1898, Butler and his brother Arthur W. Butler formed a brokerage firm in New York, George P. Butler &amp; Brother, dealing in bonds and stocks. Both brothers were members of the New York Stock Exchange and the firm was said to be associated with Gould family interests. The firm was located at 35 Wall Street.</p><p>George died suddenly in London at age 48 on April 7, 1911. His obituary in the New York Times states that he had traveled to Europe for health reasons. Records in the collection indicate that the firm was already undergoing liquidation by March 1911, before George's death. Arthur completed the firm's liquidation in July 1911. After the firm's dissolution, Arthur joined E. Hicks Herrick and Henry S. Kip to form the new partnership of Butler, Herrick and Kip.</p><p>(Source: New York Times articles)</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes fragmentary records from the financial firm George P. Butler &amp; Brother. The firm existed from 1898 to 1911; the records date primarily from the later years of the firm, that is 1906-1911, though there are gaps even within that range. Nonetheless, the firm's clients, trading activity, and transactions as market intermediaries are well-represented in the records. These records include incoming and outgoing correspondence, perhaps especially for 1909, but touching at least in part on all years from 1906-11. In addition to transaction executions, some letters include investment advice and outlook for particular securities, many of which are railroad companies. The container list identifies the more frequent correspondents. Accounting records in the collection include copies of client statements, transaction blotters, ledgers, journals, and cancelled checks/vouchers. Many of these records document the receipt of dividends and interest from railroads and other companies, and the distribution of those payments to the firm's clients.</p>  </scopecontent>

Butler &amp; Brother firm and its clients and client representatives, such as banks, attorneys, and other investment firms. Most of the letters are outgoing from the firm, either in the form of carbon copies or in sheets in three copybooks. Nonetheless, foldered correspondence also holds many incoming letters and telegrams.</p><p>Incoming correspondence generally includes client inquiries or transaction orders. Outgoing correspondence often includes order confirmations and transmittals of payments of interest, dividends and other proceeds, and of stock and bond certificates. Although most of the correspondence is transactional, a number of letters convey information about securities available, and advice about whether or not to acquire particular securities. Bonds and stocks issued by railroads appear to comprise most of the securities referenced in the letters (including, among others, the Manhattan Railway Company), but utility companies also appear.</p><p>The bulk of the foldered incoming and outgoing letters are from 1909, with a very few ranging back to 1908 or forward to early 1910. The three copybooks range from mid-1906 to early 1911, but have large gaps in coverage. </p><p>The copybooks have indexes of correspondents at the front of the volumes. These, and the correspondence generally, were skimmed by the archivist to identify any especially prominent correspondents, such as a Rockefeller or a J.P. Morgan, but none appeared. The more frequent individual correspondents, some of which are women handling financial matters, are noted in the container list.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_131d1c4859de5a3eeb13fd8c2037e501"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged with foldered correspondence, which includes both incoming and outgoing letters, followed by three volumes of letterpress copies of outgoing letters.</p><p>The foldered correspondence was found in slight disorder when processed in 2020. The archivist arranged it into what appears to be, roughly, its original order, that is, foldering together letters with common coding written on them (e.g., M-1, M-2, M-3). These codes clearly follow an alphabetical sequence (M in this example being correspondents with surname or company name beginning with M), but it is not clear what the numeric code indicates, though letters to/from any particular correspondent seem to be grouped together. The correspondence was not arranged to a finer level, such as by date.</p><p>Patrons should be cautious in handling the letters as some are held together with pins that were not removed during processing.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_8fbf228f1254000cdcc532aadd90da8c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence A</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1908-1909</unitdate><container id="aspace_d81ea75216da9dd43906770ece78e232" label="Text [10170000018781]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_d81ea75216da9dd43906770ece78e232" type="Folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9e94fec8cef297081cf7dd6b4c89c623"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Frequent correspondents include Charles H.
