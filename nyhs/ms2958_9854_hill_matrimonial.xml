    <abstract id="aspace_e1c3cf350c9f40b933da478bc9161e9d">A mimeographed letter from Mrs. W.K. Hill of Jacksonville, Florida, soliciting customers, or "members," for the services of her "matrimonial agency," which includes a monthly mailing of a list of women who registered with her bureau. The letter offers the service for $1, with a subsequent payment of $5 in the event a match results in marriage. The letter makes a sales pitch for the quality of the service and the women who are available, as well as the value of a marriage to a man. On the reverse of the letter is an application form for the men to complete, requesting information on physical characteristics, wealth, education, religion, etc. A second mimeographed document, likely included as an enclosure with the letter, lists the attributes of four women then available for marriage. The date of the letter has a typographical error and is obscured, but appears to be December 5, 1912.<lb/> <lb/>
