    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>David N. (Jim) Judelson (1928-2018) was born in Hackensack, NJ. He graduated from New York University in 1949 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and worked as Chief Engineer and then in executive capacities for Judelson Industries in Randolph, NJ through the 1950s. In 1956, Judelson bought some shares of stock in a small auto parts company, the Michigan Bumper Company. Coincidentally, an Austrian-born entrepreneur, Charles Bluhdorn (1926-1983), bought what became a controlling amount of shares in the same company. In 1958, Bluhdorn asked John Duncan (1928-2020) and, shortly after, Judelson to join the company in order to expand the organization through acquisitions, with Judelson focused on manufacturing firms. After an initial acquisition of the Michigan Plating &amp; Stamping Co., the conglomerate eventually took the name Gulf and Western Industries in the 1960s and grew spectacularly, even attracting the attention of a congressional antitrust investigation in 1969. </p><p>In 1968, after Duncan was promoted, Judelson became President and Chief Operating Officer of G+W, as well as a member of the Board and Executive Committee. Through the 1970s, the company continued its aggressive growth through mergers and acquisitions. Beginning in the mid-1960s, the company had also diversified beyond its manufacturing and extraction origins into new industries, notably entertainment with the acquisition of, for example, Paramount Pictures in 1966. Later, in 1977, Madison Square Garden and its sports teams were added. In 1980, G+W announced an initiative to manufacture an electric vehicle, powered by a zinc chloride battery, though that eventually faltered. </p><p>In 1979, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged G+W, Bluhdorn, and another senior executive with fraud. The matter was finally settled in 1981. In 1983, Bluhdorn died suddenly of a heart attack. Perceiving that he did not have sufficient support from the Board for the position, Judelson did not put his name forward as a candidate for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) position, despite being considered by some to be the "heir apparent" to Bluhdorn. The position went instead to Martin S. Davis, who had come through the ranks from Paramount Pictures and had held various senior administrative positions at G+W. (The Board also passed over Judelson's contemporary, John Duncan, who was also still in a leadership role at G+W.) Judelson then resigned from G+W, moving on to other ventures. Judelson died in 2018. Martin Davis began divesting G+W of its broad array of industries, focusing on entertainment and eventually dropping the Gulf and Western name in favor of Paramount Communications. The company was bought by Viacom in 1994 and is now part of that conglomerate. </p><p>(The above note was based on various on-line sources, especially New York Times articles, obituaries, and Wikipedia, and Judelson's resignation statement in the collection.)</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The collection includes documents compiled by David N. (Jim) Judelson during his career at Gulf + Western, primarily from the 1960s until his resignation in early 1983.

There are also topical files on the SEC investigation of G+W from 1977-81, the sale of Consolidated Cigar during the company's divestitures in 1982, and other matters.</p><p>Judelson's records include his correspondence files (1968-83); appointment books (1969-83); speeches and other statements by Judelson (1967-82); G+W's various executive compensation plans, including stock options, and Judelson's participation in the plans; and records of Judelson's personal securities transactions in G+W and other companies' stock.
