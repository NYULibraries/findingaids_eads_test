    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Royal Lampman Haynes (1908â€“1977), was born in Cortland, New York, to Marvin J. and Cornelia (Tulley) Haynes, both natives of Preble, New York. He graduated from the School of Physical Education at Cortland State Teachers College in 1930, and for four years subsequently was foreman of the 1285th Company, Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp at Attica, New York. He then became a junior officer of the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia. A resident of Tallahassee, Florida, since 1941, Haynes enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on 8 May 1943, rising from Private First Class to Sergeant on 25 November of that year. He was stationed at Guam between July 1944 and shortly before his discharge on 9 December 1945. Haynes later worked for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a subdivision of the United States Department of Justice. He died in Tallahassee in 1977 at the age of sixty-nine.</p><p>[This note is drawn from information in the collection, as well as Haynes's obituary in the <emph render="italic">Tallahassee Democrat</emph> (Tallahassee, Fla.), Friday 29 April 1977, p. 16.]</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of three volumes and one large-format photgraph. The albums are</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
      <head>Missing Title</head>
      <item>A photograph album of cartes de visite and cabinet cards depicting members of the Tulley, Haynes, and allied families. Inscribed "Mrs. Minerva S. Tulley, Preble, N.Y., October 26, 1887," but apparently holds images taken earlier and possibly later. Minerva S. Tulley was the maternal grandmother of Royal L. Haynes.</item>
      <item>A photograph album marked "Property of R. L. Haynes," 1930s-1940s, documenting his time as foreman of the 1285th Company, Civilian Conservation Corps, at Camp SCS-1, Attica, New York.</item>
      <item>A pre-printed album--<emph render="italic">Life in the Service / "Memoirs of the Marines"</emph>--filled in by Royal L. Haynes between 1943 and 1945 with personal details, his medical history, military service dates, and friends' addresses. Haynes inserted into this album his U.S. Marine Corps driver's license and certificate of satisfactory service, some newspaper clippings, and a letter from Robert J. Kirby, warden of Sing Sing Prison, inviting him to witness the executions of Eli E. Shonbrun and John Cullen on 29 April 1943. Shonbrun (alias Ted Leopold) and Cullen were jewel thieves who robbed and murdered Susan Flora Reich in Manhattan on 4 March 1942.</item>
    </list>
<p>The large format photographic collage shows the 1285th Company CCC at Camp SCS-1, Attica, New York, on 1 September 1938. Royal L. Haynes served four years as foreman of this camp.</p>  </scopecontent>
