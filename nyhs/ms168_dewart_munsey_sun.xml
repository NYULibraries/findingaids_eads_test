    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The New York <emph render="italic">Sun</emph> was the first successful penny daily newspaper in the United States.  Founded by printer Benjamin Day in 1833, the<emph render="italic">Sun</emph> was purchased in 1865 by Charles Dana, and within three years reached a circulation of 130,000.  An evening edition was added in 1887, and in 1916, the morning<emph render="italic">Sun</emph> and the<emph render="italic">Evening Sun</emph> were sold to publisher Frank A. Munsey. </p><p>Munsey was born in Mercer, Maine, in 1854.  As a young man with (in his own words) "insatiable ambition," he rose to the position of manager in the Augusta, Maine, telegraph office. Becoming interested in the publishing business, in 1882 he moved to New York City and founded the<emph render="italic">Golden Argosy</emph>, a magazine for boys.   After six years, Munsey revamped it into an adult magazine, renamed the <emph render="italic">Argosy</emph>, and now generally regarded as the first "pulp" magazine.  In 1889, Munsey started <emph render="italic">Munsey's Magazine</emph>, America's first cheap general-circulation illustrated magazine, which was selling 800,000 copies monthly by 1906.  Having made a fortune with his magazines, Munsey began expanding his publishing empire to include newspapers: the <emph render="italic">Star</emph> (1891), the <emph render="italic">Press</emph> (1912), the <emph render="italic">Sun</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Evening Sun</emph> (1916), the <emph render="italic">Herald</emph> and associated papers (1920) and <emph render="italic">The Globe</emph> (1924).  In addition to these New York papers, Munsey also owned the <emph render="italic">Baltimore News</emph>, which he purchased in 1908.  </p><p>After purchasing the <emph render="italic">Sun</emph> papers, Munsey merged the morning edition with his <emph render="italic">New York Press</emph>.  In 1920, he closed the morning <emph render="italic">Sun</emph>, and the evening edition was renamed simply <emph render="italic">The Sun</emph>.  Munsey bought <emph render="italic">The Globe</emph> and merged it with the <emph render="italic">Sun</emph> in 1924 in order to obtain an Associated Press membership.  In addition to his publishing activities, in 1913 Munsey founded the "Munsey Trust Corporation," which was subsequently re-organized as the "Equitable Trust Company" with Munsey as chairman of the board.</p><p>Munsey's ceaseless buying, selling and merging of competing publications earned him a reputation as a ruthless entrepreneur, and he is remembered more for his business activities than as an author or editor.  However, Munsey also wrote five novels, and during the 1912 presidential campaign became the mouthpiece for "bull-moose" candidate Theodore Roosevelt, co-founding the Progressive Party and writing a series of articles supporting the former president's bid for election.</p><p>In December, 1925, Munsey died of a burst appendix, and the paper was purchased by William Thompson Dewart, president and treasurer of the Sun company and the executor of Munsey's estate (Munsey left the bulk of his vast estate, including his newspapers, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art).  Dewart's son, Thomas W. Dewart, succeeded him as president and publisher in 1944.  In 1950, the Dewart family sold the <emph render="italic">Sun</emph> to the <emph render="italic">New York World-Telegram</emph>. </p>  </bioghist>

The images are mainly portraits of authors, artists and business and political figures who were prominent in the 1930's and 1940's. In addition to "famous" figures of the time, there are images of more obscure figures such as judges, FBI agents, and corporate officers. Portraits of Sun staff are also included.  There are also a few photographs of events and places.</p><p>The series is organized into three subseries: Subseries V.1, Card catalog; Subseries V.2, Glass negatives; and Subseries V.3, Film negatives.</p><p>The file card catalog in Subseries V.1 serves as an index to the negatives in Subseries V.2 and V.3.  The catalog is arranged alphabetically.  Portraits are arranged by the sitter's last name; other images are arranged mainly by location, such as "City of New York," or "India."  Each card lists the number of the corresponding negative in the upper right hand corner.  In some but not all cases, a photographic print is also attached.</p><p>Negatives are individually sleeved and identified only by number.  They are arranged sequentially, but film and glass negatives (which were originally interspersed) have been re-housed separately.  This means that there are two possible locations for any specific negative number; accordingly, researchers looking for a particular negative should request the box with the appropriate range of negative numbers from both Subseries V.2, Glass negative, and V.3, Film negatives.</p><p>Film negatives, which are nitrate film and are held in cold storage, must be requested at least 72 hours in advance and require a confirmed appointment to view.</p><p>Negative numbers preceded by a letter are apparently not included in the card index.  Identifying information for a few of these images is provided on the negative sleeve, but most are not identified.  Among the subjects depicted are an early automobile race and a trip to Hawaii.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref254_qtz" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries V.1: File card
