<p>W. (William) Stebbins Smith was born about 1846. He attended Columbia Law School, graduating in the 1870s. By 1881, he had joined his father, Chauncey Smith, who was also a lawyer, in practice in the Bronx, New York. Smith's practice seems to have centered principally on real estate property transactions and general estate administration. He lived in the Bronx and practiced law there for about 65 years, retiring in the mid-1930s. He seems to have worked out of the same office at 462 East 167th Street for most, and perhaps all, of his career (though the city changed the building number at least once during his ownership). Smith was active in various civic, professional, and religious organizations. As one example, he served a two-year term in 1903-04 as the first president of the Bronx County Bar Association. Smith died in Kingston, NY, in 1937 at age 91.</p><p>(The above note was based on Smith's obituary in the New York Times, other on-line references, and documents in the collection.)</p>  </bioghist>

In addition to the many individuals represented by Smith, the collection includes records related to the real estate transactions of various Methodist Episcopal churches that engaged Smith.</p><p>As a member of the Bronx community himself, Smith's papers also include a sizable amount of correspondence and other documents related to local politics, trade, transit, and charitable causes.</p>  </scopecontent>

It appears that when the W. Stebbins Smith collection was first acquired by N-YHS in 1938, it included much more material related to Smith's father, Chauncey Smith, than is currently in the collection. That material was separated into a different collection, the Chauncey Smith papers. There is no finding aid currently for those papers, but they are cataloged in Bobcat; follow this <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/22u4kq/nyu_aleph000798479">link</extref>. Some W. Stebbins Smith-related documents can also be found in those Chauncey Smith papers.</p><p>A single W. Stebbins Smith document was cataloged in the AHMC collection: W. Stebbins Smith title fee payment, 1907 May 7 (AHMC - Smith, W. Stebbins).</p><p>N-YHS also holds the Mysterious Star Club Minutes, 1864 Sept. 12-1865 Aug. 2 (BV Mysterious Star Club). W. Stebbins Smith was an officer of that club.</p><p>The New-York Historical Society's museum holds W.

The boxes had deteriorated so the contents were removed into archival folders and rehoused in October 2021, but the arrangement of the folders retained that of the letterboxes. </p><p>The series primarily includes incoming letters, and also holds drafts or copies of outgoing letters and various forms of print matter and ephemera (e.g., newspaper clippings, advertisements, pamphlets, political handbills, programs, business cards, solicitations for donations, etc.).</p><p>The correspondence was only skimmed for subject matter content by the archivist. It appears that there is some correspondence here related to Smith's clients/legal matters, but these seem to be mostly of a transactional nature (e.g., arrangements for title searches, inquiries about potential matters, etc.); more client-related correspondence is likely found with the legal files in Series III.</p><p>More extensive here is Smith's correspondence on personal affairs and on matters that lie on the blurry boundary between personal and professional interests. These include documents related to elections and politics (filed under "P") and to Smith's apparent support for the Republican Club of the City of New York (under "R"). A consistently sizable amount of material over the years is found filed under "C" for various churches, most especially those of the Methodist Episcopal denomination in the Bronx and New York City generally, and for various Christian charitable causes, such as the YMCA. Under "T" can be found extensive material from the North Side Board of Trade in the City of New York (renamed in 1914 as the Bronx Board of Trade in the City of New York). While some of this material is of a general solicitation nature, some is specific to Smith and reflects his deeper support of some of these institutions and activities.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f6dc9f76846b6eda7a47b7849b4daea9"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series retains the order of the original letterboxes from which the contents were removed. Based on the original label on the spine of the boxes, most of the letterboxes held documents from one of two 6-month periods for each year (January 1-July 1 and July 1-January 1). It seems likely, though, that some of the boxes held documents from somewhat outside their stated date range. A few letterboxes explicitly held documents from longer periods, that is, one or more years. </p><p><emph render="italic">Within each box, documents were further arranged alphabetically by Smith, but how that was applied by him was idiosyncratic and somewhat inconsistent over time. No rearrangement was done when the archivist rehoused the documents. Although many documents were filed by correspondent surname, much more was filed by a keyword or general subject regardless of the name.</emph> As examples: Banks tend to be under B; miscellaneous Bronx-oriented organizations are also under B; churches and Christian associations tend to be under C; lawyer or legal associations under L; candidates for public office and election matters under P for politics, except those specific to the Republican Party, which is under R; trade or transit organizations tend to be under T. Nonetheless, despite these filing trends, there are some inconsistencies in how names were filed over time. </p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_3008e35e5c2dd88b76ea9e983cae8a46"><head>Processing Information</head><p>The series was processed at a minimal level by archivist Larry Weimer in October 2021.

Stebbins Smith. The series has not been processed and so this description is based on a quick survey of the content of each box. Perhaps half of the series remains in its original condition of tri-folded documents tied together in bundles, often several inches in depth. The rest of the documents are loose and so their relationship, if any, to surrounding documents is unclear.</p><p>Overall, the legal matters appear to center, perhaps exclusively so, on real estate property transactions and general estate matters (i.e., administration of wills). These appear to principally concern Bronx communities such as Morrisania, Melrose, Olinville, Highbridgeville, West Farms, and Wakefield, and others not noted. Property in areas outside the Bronx, such as White Plains, are also represented in the series. Transactions include purchases, sales, and leases of property, as well as claims related to property ownership, such as tax liens, assessments for improvements, damage claims against or on behalf of owners, and the like. </p><p>Generally, it appears that Smith represented individuals, not corporate/institutional interests. One major exception to this is that he seems to have often represented local Methodist Episcopal churches, including the Centreville African Methodist Episcopal Church, in their real estate matters, as reflected in the series. </p><p>Documents in the series include title abstracts, deeds, insurance policies, contracts/agreements, wills, mortgages, assessments, damage claims, property maps, tax bills, and other real estate transaction-related documents. Print matter is found throughout, such as newspaper clippings of real estate auctions and other related matters, auction broadsides, tax lien and other property-related lists, etc. There is extensive, though scattered, correspondence. Much of this relates to legal matters, but much also relates to other matters as reflected in the correspondence of Series I. Some of this appears to have formerly been in letterboxes such as those represented in Series I, while other letters are loose.</p><p>The majority of the documents, dating from the 1880s-1930s, relate to the activities of W. Stebbins Smith. The series also includes many documents from the 1840s-1870s that relate to Smith's father, Chauncey Smith, who was also a lawyer. There is some overlap in the 1870s and perhaps in the early 1880s as the father and son partnered for a brief time. Some documents relate to Smith's handling of Chauncey's estate. It is also likely that some of the early documents do not relate to Chauncey's activities, but were compiled by W. Stebbins Smith as part of his file on matters of a later date.</p><p>In the container list, the phrase "Holds typical mix of tri-folded bundles and loose documents on various matters" is used to indicate that the above-described broad mix of documents is present in the box. In some instances, particular document types or legal matters could be readily discerned on a quick survey and those were also noted in the container list, but should not be taken as encompassing a box's entire content. None of the tri-folded bundles were unbound during the survey so the survey could only perceive the content based on the description from the outermost document (which was often the title abstract with the name of the matter). Date ranges are rough and based on the (relatively few) viewed documents. </p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f8a749197808e1e8062225ff5c73a193"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series has not been processed and generally there is no organization to the documents. Overall, each box in the series holds documents from a wide date range and on various matters. Documents on what appears to be the same or related matters are found in more than one box (e.g., the names John B. Suffern, George Stolz, Jennie Irving, and John Devoe are among the many that appear on documents throughout the boxes in the series). However, much of the material is tri-folded and tied together in thick bundles, with presumably some relationship that can possibly be determined from the labeling on the outermost document.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_a9f71fb79f483dad2717a2322081f3ea"><head>Processing Information</head><p>The series has not been processed.
