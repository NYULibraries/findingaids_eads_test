      <abstract id="aspace_cba7d10b69cfe1d27130f2ff47f350eb">The collection documents the programs and administration of the New York Foundling Hospital, 1869-2009, and the St. Agatha Home for Children, which operated separately from the Foundling beginning in 1884, before merging into the Foundling in 1977. The Foundling opened in 1869, under the auspices of the Sisters of Charity, as a Catholic haven for abandoned babies.  It was one of the principal institutions sending children to live with families in the country, in a program known today as the "orphan train."  That program ended in 1929.  Thereafter the Foundling expanded, diversified, and decentralized. Today the Foundling is an organization providing foster care, adoption, social work, and community-based preventive and health services to children and families in New York and Puerto Rico.

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">The Early Years</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The Foundling Asylum of the Sisters of Charity in the City of New York opened at 17 East 12th Street on October 11, 1869, as a Catholic haven for abandoned babies.  Sister Mary Irene Fitzgibbon (Sister Irene), formerly Superior at St. Peter's on Barclay Street, founded the institution.  The nuns placed a cradle outside the building to receive infants, and almost immediately the shelter was filled to capacity.</p>
      <p>Sister Irene quickly instituted a Boarding-Out Department through which off-site married wet nurses took in one or two babies, and were provided an allowance.  Alternatively, to encourage mothers to remain with their infants at the Foundling for at least three months, the sisters stopped leaving the crib outside the door, requiring the mother to ring the bell and deliver the child to the sister in attendance.  When a mother could be persuaded to stay, she could nurse another infant besides her own, and might ideally choose to keep her baby upon leaving the Foundling.</p>
      <p>The building was too small for the hundreds of children the Foundling received.  The asylum moved to larger quarters at 3 Washington Square in 1870, and moved again in 1873.  The state granted the Foundling an entire block, 68th-69th Streets, Lexington-Third Avenues, which the Foundling developed into a grand Victorian institutional complex.  The main building at 175 East 68th Street was completed in 1873, followed by St. Ann's Maternity Hospital on the corner of 69th and Lexington in 1880, St. John's Children's Hospital on the corner of 69th and Third in 1881, St. Irene's residence (originally built as a quarantine for weaned babies returned from boarding with wet nurses) on the corner of 68th and Third in 1896, and the Hillyer Memorial Building, built ca. 1906-1907 on 68th and Lexington as a dormitory and kindergarten for young children.  </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">The "Orphan Train"</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The issue of how to care for children past infancy was pressing.  In 1873 the Foundling began chartering trains (now known as "orphan trains") to carry children to Catholic families in Maryland, and later to other states in the West and South.  The Foundling's placing-out program was part of a larger movement, run by many organizations from the mid-nineteenth century through the 1920s.  During this period, tens of thousands of children without families willing or able to care for them were transported out of the city to country homes, contributing to the country's westward expansion.  Most children from New York City were sent either by the Children's Aid Society (beginning in 1853) or the Foundling (beginning 20 years later).  Families receiving children from the Foundling signed a document agreeing to raise the child Catholic, and giving the institution legal right to remove the "indentured" child should the placement prove unsatisfactory.  Before children went west, they lived and attended nursery school at the Foundling.  </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Evolution of the Foundling</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1891 the Foundling Asylum changed its name to the New York Foundling Hospital, and amended its mission to formally include not only abandoned children and foundlings but also destitute and dependent children.  Sister Irene died in 1896.  Sister Teresa Vincent McCrystal, who had been with Sister Irene since the inception, took over as Director.  She saw the institution through two crises.  </p>
      <p>The first was an incident in Arizona in 1904, in which a mob of non-Catholic Anglo families forcibly removed children from Catholic Mexican families with whom they had been placed by the Foundling.  The Supreme Court of Arizona ruled against the Foundling, in New York Foundling Hospital v Gatti in 1905, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case.  </p>
      <p>The other crisis was a sensationalized investigation of the city's private (particularly Catholic) child-caring institutions and of the State Board of Charities by John A. Kingsbury, New York City's Commissioner of Charities, in 1916.  Although the Foundling was not singled out for censure, the organization was required to submit to more city oversight and to change its foundational principle that a mother might surrender her child with no questions asked.  </p>
      <p>After Sister Teresa Vincent's death in 1917, Sister Anna Michella Bowen, who had been in charge of the placing-out program, succeeded her.  In 1926, Sister Xavier Maria Hurley became director, and ended the placing-out program in the west and south.  She was followed by Sister Dominica Maria Rochford in 1931 who continued her predecessor's work of professionalizing the Foundling's social work programs.  </p>
      <p>A 60 acre annex, St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea, donated by Charles Schwab of Bethlehem Steel, opened at Huguenot, Staten Island, in 1910 for overflow of mothers and babies.  In 1927 the Foundling charter was amended to advocate that families be kept together whenever possible, and that adopted and foster families reside in the New York area so that more intensive supervision could be maintained.  The policy of "indenture" was discontinued, and the maternity and pediatric hospitals became teaching hospitals.  A School for Baby Nurses began training students that year.  A Social Service Department for unwed mothers was initiated in 1930.  In the 1930's, the Foundling consisted of St. John's Children's Hospital, St. Ann's Maternity Hospital, the Boarding Department, the Adoption Department, St. Mary's Temporary Shelter for unmarried mothers, and the St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea annex.  </p>
      <p>The two hospitals were closed in 1945 and 1946. After that, the Foundling focused less on medical services and emphasized foster and adoption services, nursery care for children and shelter for unwed mothers.  In 1958, they left their Victorian complex on 68th Street, and moved across the street to new modern headquarters at 1175 Third Avenue.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">From the 1960's to the Present</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In the 1960's and 1970's, the organization decentralized into local community based residences, day care centers, family service programs and preventive service facilities, and opened an office in Puerto Rico, while continuing to provide institutional care, boarding home care, and adoption for children, and services to unmarried mothers.  The Foundling merged with the St. Agatha Home for Children in 1977 and the latter became the St. Agatha Home of the New York Foundling Hospital.  St. Agatha, also run by the Sisters of Charity, was founded in 1884 as a home for orphan girls, but had diversified to run group homes for developmentally disabled children, children with emotional problems, refugee children, and others.  </p>
      <p>A 1985 booklet by Sister Marian Healy described the NY Foundling Hospital as "a family-oriented agency administered under Catholic auspices and committed to the preservation of family life, especially those whose family life is disrupted through poverty, sickness, and neglect…All of the services of the Foundling, administered by the Sisters of Charity, are part of the ministry of the Catholic Church in the Archdiocese of New York.  It is our aim to foster the compassion of the Gospel by recognizing the absolute worth of every individual."</p>
      <p>The Foundling moved into a smaller building at 595 Avenue of the Americas in 1988.  The Third Avenue building had been designed as an orphanage, but the new building was built with wide halls and large therapy rooms to reflect a new mission of helping handicapped and seriously ill children, as well as providing a maternity shelter for teens in their last trimester, a crisis nursery for abused or neglected children, and centers for emotionally disturbed pre-teens and teen girls.  The Vincent J. Fontana Center, a separate building dedicated to child abuse prevention and treatment, opened on Christopher Street in 1999.  </p>
      <p>The St. Agatha property in Nanuet was sold in 2005.  That same year, the Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center became an independent entity in the 595 Avenue of the Americas building, separate from the Foundling.  The Foundling no longer managed a hospital, and dropped the word "hospital" from its name. These changes allowed the Foundling to expand its core services of foster care and adoption, and to develop new community-based programs.  In 2007 it embarked on a demonstration project to provide support and guidance to youth in the juvenile justice system and their families, to keep offenders in their homes and communities rather than detained in an institution.  In 2008, the Foundling partnered with the Mott Haven Academy to create the first charter school in the nation specifically designed to serve children in foster care and the child welfare system.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection documents the programs and administration of the New York Foundling Hospital, 1869-2009, and the St. Agatha Home for Children, which operated separately from the Foundling beginning in 1884, before merging into the Foundling in 1977. </p>
      <p>The collection includes minutes and annual reports; correspondence and memos; bound registers and other administrative volumes; pamphlets, brochures and fliers; legal documents; reports; grant proposals; manuals; birth certificates; clippings and periodicals; published books; audiovisual materials including VHS tapes; and photographic prints.  There are a particularly large number of materials by and about Vincent Fontana, Medical Director of the Foundling (1962-2005) in Series IV.6. Unusual items in the collection include circa 1000 notes by mothers and other guardians leaving babies at the Foundling 1869-1884 (Series XIII). There are also yearbooks from the Foundling's nursing school 1948-1970 (Series IV.29), and two nurse's capes (Series XVI).</p>
      <p>The collection is notable for its large number of photographic prints. The majority of prints are 8x10s created by professional photographers for public relations purposes.  There are also many non-professional snapshots documenting activities for internal purposes, from recent years.  Most photographs date from 1950-2000, but there are some prints from earlier decades of the Foundling.  Many photographs are interspersed throughout the collection, arranged according to the department or program they document.  Others are collected in a separate chronological series of visual materials (Series XI).  This arrangement reflects the original order of the materials as they were kept at the Foundling.  Claire Yaffa, James Heffernan and David M. Grossman are the professional photographers most represented in the collection.</p>
      <p>The Foundling is well known for its participation in the "Orphan Train;" however, genealogical researchers should be aware that this collection contains no case files from the placing-out and boarding-out program.  Those records remain at the New York Foundling Hospital.  The collection at the New-York Historical Society includes documents of the 1904 "Arizona Incident" and materials from reunions of Orphan Train riders from the 1960s to the present.  The collection also includes restricted volumes 1869-1958 which contain information on Orphan Train children, among other children and parents.  <emph render="bold">Special permission is needed from the New York Foundling Hospital to view records that include personal information on children, labeled as Restricted in this finding aid.</emph>  Restricted records include books of baptisms and confirmations, registers of mothers, foster home records, etc.</p>

      <p>The collection was donated in 2009 by the New York Foundling Hospital.  Much of the material was collected and assembled by Sister Marilda Joseph at the Foundling, beginning in September 1997.  She sent questionnaires to, and requested materials from, administrators of Foundling programs, and kept these materials grouped by program.  Beginning in late 2006, Richard Reilly of the Ignation Volunteer Corps, in consultation with administrators at the Foundling, rearranged some of Sister Marilda's categories, added new ones, and incorporated other materials from the Sisters of Charity archives, materials from the Vincent Fontana Center, and materials from the basement of 590 Avenue of the Americas.</p>

          <head>Arrangement</head>
          <p>Minutes 1869-1979 are arranged chronologically.  Minutes are followed by reports to the Board of Managers/Trustees in folders arranged chronologically 1936-1978, followed by reports to the Board in binders 1957-1978 (missing 1969-1971).  The reports in binders duplicate some of the material in the folders.  The folders entitled "Administrator's reports to the board..." also contain reports by other committees, as well as some correspondence, memos, and related materials.  The material in the folders was kept together in this way at the Foundling.</p>

          <head>Historical Note</head>
          <p>The Board of Managers existed from 1869 through March of 1974, consisting of members of the Sisters of Charity assisted by a lay advisory board.  The Board of Trustees superceded the Board of Managers in September of 1974.  At this time, the Administrator of the Foundling became known as the Executive Director.</p>

            <p>The subseries contains an incomplete set of reports distributed to the public and potential donors.  There are multiple copies of many reports, including bound copies 1869-1917 and individual copies 1885-2000.  There are some gaps, including no reports 1936-1943 or 1948-1961 (see Series VII.2 to fill in gaps 1958-1962).  Bound copies are arranged first, followed by individual copies.</p>
            <p>Annual Reports from 1958-1966 were published as the March issue of <emph render="italic">Mater Dei</emph>, a monthly publication of the Foundling.  This series includes loose copies of the annual report issues of <emph render="italic">Mater Dei</emph> from 1963-1965.  Bound copies of the periodical, which include annual reports 1958-1962 not represented in this subseries, may be found in Series VII.2 - Newsletters.</p>

            <p>The subseries consists of annual reports of all departments at the Foundling bound together with introductory notes 1934-1972. 1938-1945 are missing, except for a disbound and shorter internal annual report from 1942; there are also gaps from 1949-1963 and 1970-1971. </p>
            <p>These internal annual reports tend to contain more statistical information than the published annual reports in the previous subseries.  This subseries concludes with one folder containing miscellaneous departmental annual reports 1977 and 1981.  The miscellaneous reports were prepared by departments not represented elsewhere in the collection.  </p>
            <p>For separate reports by other departments, see Series IV.</p>

            <p>The subseries consists mainly of annual inspections of the Foundling by the State Board of Charities, renamed the State Department of Social Welfare in 1930.  These are followed by annual reports to other organizations.</p>
            <p>The State Board of Charities performed annual or biannual inspections of the Foundling beginning in 1900.  This New York State government department changed its name to the State Department of Social Welfare in 1930.  The subseries contains inspections by the state agencies of the Foundling's Infant Asylum 1900-1928, the Foundling's hospitals 1900-1910 and 1930-1944, the Foundling's Placing-Out and Boarding-Out Departments 1901-1935, the Foundling as a whole in 1944 and 1951, as well as annual reports by the Foundling to the State Department of Social Welfare 1937-1951. </p>
            <p>The subseries concludes with three other annual reports: an annual report of the Section on Care of Dependent Children to the Welfare Council of New York City (an association of social service agencies including the Foundling), 1936; and 2 annual reports of the Foundling to the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum (1952 and 1953).  Note that Series IV.5 - Boarding Department - also includes annual reports of that department prepared for the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum. </p>
            <p>For State Department of Social Welfare/Board of Charities inspections of the St. Joseph's-by-The-Sea facility, see Series IV.38 - St. Joseph's-by-The-Sea.</p>

          <p>This series contains a variety of different types of records, including the Foundling's constitution and by-laws and revisions to these, a small amount of selected correspondence, reports, policy manuals, grant proposals, strategic plans, and legal documents, arranged in chronological order.  Many records relate to the purchase, construction, or maintenance of real estate.  </p>
          <p>The records most often concern the institution as a whole, as opposed to individual programs or departments of the Foundling.  Records of individual centers, programs, and departments are arranged as Series IV.   </p>

          <head>Scope and Content</head>
          <p>This series consists of 47 subseries, arranged alphabetically by program, center or department, using categories created mostly by Sister Marilda Joseph Aiello or by other representatives of the Foundling.  Many subseries contain only a few folders, or sometimes a single folder, of material.  Materials include correspondence, proposals, reports, pamphlets or brochures, and clippings.  Many subseries contain photographic prints, arranged at the end of the subseries.</p>
          <p>The bulk of the individual programs collected in this series were initiated in the 1970's-1990's.  There are, however, significant exceptions, including the Boarding Department and the Ladies Auxiliary which both began in 1869, St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea which began in 1910, and Nurse Training which began in 1927.</p>
          <p>The records of the St. Agatha Home for Children are not collected in this series.  They are arranged separately as Series V, because the program operated independently from the Foundling from 1884 to 1977.  Thereafter, it became a program of the Foundling.  </p>
          <p>The scope and content notes for some subseries refer the researcher to other subseries which may also have pertinent information. </p>

            <p>The subseries contains proposals, reports, memos, correspondence, a pamphlet, and photographic prints.</p>
            <p>The Abusing Mother-Child project, subsequently known as the Program for the Rehabilitation of Mothers of Abused and Neglected Children, the Program for Neglecting and Abusing Mothers and Their Children, the Abusing Parents and Child Unit, the Temporary Shelter for Abusing Parents, and finally the Child Abuse Rehabilitation Program was a program designed to give counseling and services to mothers to help stop child abuse, and to keep families together.  It began in September 1972, operated in tandem with the Temporary Shelter, and was phased out in 1987.  </p>

            <p>This subseries contains documents related to the Boarding Department, the Homefinding and Placement Departments, which originated as divisions of the Boarding Department, and the Foster Boarding Home Departments of the NY Foundling Hospital, and to foster care in general at the Foundling.

            <p>Correspondence with Special Services for Children (Box 22, folders 14-17) includes correspondence related to Foundling programs that did not provide foster care services, as well as programs that did.  All correspondence is kept in this subseries as per original order.</p>
            <p>From the Foundling's inception to the present day, a large part of the organization's work has involved boarding and foster care services.  Many other series and subseries in this collection contain documents relating to boarding and foster care, including but not limited to the Series IV subseries Adoption, AOBH, Blaine Hall, Bronx Community Services, St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea, and the Westchester Office.</p>
            <p>Newsletters of the Association of Foster Parents 1955-1966 may be found in Series VII.   </p>

            <p>The Crisis Nursery was established in 1982 to provide free emergency crisis care to children and families.  Beginning in 2001 it operated under the umbrella of the Fontana Center of the Foundling.  Children up to age 7 (and some older siblings) could stay in the nursery up to twenty-one days (with some exceptions), and were provided lodging, medical care, clothing, meals, behavioral assessments, and supervised play sessions.  Parents received counseling, crisis intervention, emergency funds, and referrals for additional services.  The Crisis Nursery operated a 24-hour Parent Helpline for parents in crisis.</p>

            <p>The East Harlem Neighborhood Center began in 1975 as a foster care prevention program focusing particularly on adolescent and young parents.  In January 1978 it moved to space on the ground floor of Lehman Houses on 110th Street.  The program has provided assistance to families in the form of health, welfare, housing, and vocational services, individual casework and group counselling, education in parenting and household management skills, mini day care and respite services, and activity groups for teens.  </p>
            <p>Materials include proposals, pamphlets, reports, clippings, and photographic prints. Most prints are circa 1976.  See also Parents as Partners subseries.</p>

            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>The Vincent J. Fontana Center for Child Protection was established in 1999, and opened in a dedicated facility at 27 Christopher Street in Manhattan in November 2004.  The Center was founded to provide community-based preventive services and therapy for children and families damaged by abuse and neglect, as well as training and education programs for child-care professionals.  It also housed a research and devlopment department studying interventions against child abuse to discern best practices.</p>
            <p>The center was initiated by, and named after, Dr. Vincent J. Fontana, Medical Director of the New York Foundling Hospital from March 1962 until his July 2005 death. In his campaign against child abuse, he was the author of <emph render="italic">The Maltreated Child</emph> (1964) and <emph render="italic">Somewhere a Child is Crying</emph> (1973), among other books, articles and papers. He was also an allergy specialist.</p>

Documents specific to the center itself appear in the period 1999-2008.  There are also circa 250 photographic prints of Dr. Fontana and the Fontana Center, arranged at the end of the subseries. A few other photographic prints in this subseries are housed in Box 27, Folder 4.</p>

            <p>The Foster Grandparent Program began as a federally-funded program created by the Johnson Administration's Office of Economic Opportunity in 1965, to enable retirees to earn a small income building one-on-one relationships with needy children.  The Foundling has been a New York host agency for the program since its inception to the present.  The federally-administered program is currently funded by the Foster Grandparent Program of the NYC Department for the Aging. </p>

The clinic also served clients referred by other departments, such as children from Blaine Hall and foster children.

            <p>The subseries contains materials related to four associations that raised money for the Foundling.  Associations are arranged in alphabetical order.  </p>
            <p>The Dongan Guild of N.Y. State Employees held annual Christmas parties and Communion Breakfasts, among other events, to benefit the Foundling.  One folder of materials 1961-1974.</p>
            <p>The Gothams, Inc. was an association which held an annual debutante ball, of which the Foundling was sole beneficiary.  Two folders of materials including photographic prints, circa 1948-1982.</p>
            <p>The Ladies Auxiliary was founded in 1869 simultaneously with the Foundling itself.  The iconic cradle wherein mothers deposited babies was donated by the first president of the Ladies Auxiliary, Mrs. Caroline Gilbert Thebaud, who served as president until 1902.  The Ladies Auxiliary's purpose over the years included, but was not limited to, sewing and knitting clothing for children at the Foundling, hosting benefits, and soliciting donations.  Materials include by-laws, constitution and charter, a volume of minutes, correspondence, donation booklets, programs, reports, invitations, clippings, and photographic prints, 1869-1986.</p>
            <p>Lots for Little, Inc. was a thrift shop created for the benefit of eight Catholic organizations, including the Foundling.  Members of the Foundling's Ladies Auxiliary volunteered at Lots for Little, and served as intermediaries between the Foundling and Lots for Little.  One folder of materials 1960-1987.</p>
            <p>Other records of Foundling fundraising, excluding these four associations, may be found throughout the rest of the collection.  See Series VIII-Events, for programs from Ladies Auxiliary-sponsored events.</p>

            <p>The Mother/Child Program began operating in 1972, at the Foundling's main location. Throughout the decade, it expanded its service at that location, added a facility in the Bronx in 1979, and moved entirely to the Bronx in 1988.  The program's purpose was to provide temporary residence for teen mothers, and to teach parenting and other life skills.  In this respect, it bears a relation to earlier Foundling programs for unwed mothers, such as St. Mary's Shelter.  </p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The subseries is arranged with mixed materials (correspondence, pamphlets, minutes, a textbook, newsletters) arranged chronologically, followed by a nearly complete set of yearbooks from most graduating classes 1948-1965 and 1970, followed by circa 100 photographic prints 1936-1964. Three yearbooks from 1948 also contain photographic prints, attached with photocorners.</p>
            <p>The correspondence in the series appears to have been grouped to reflect the program at three milestone points -- its inception, its shift to becoming a child care training program, and its closing.  There is no correspondence from intervening years.</p>
            <p>For related material, please see Series XVI - Nurse's Capes, as well Series IV.29, Nursery School.  Foundling nurses and nurses-in-training worked with the children of the nursery school, and the programs shared a director and staff.</p>

            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>The Foundling operated a school for baby nurses beginning in 1927.  Between 1941 and 1950 the program went through a state of flux, as St. John's Children's Hospital at the Foundling closed and the mission of the nursing school changed to reflect the mission of the Foundling -- to care for dependent or neglected children, rather than sick children.  State certifying agencies also expressed concern that Foundling students trained in the care of well babies and children should not be confused with practical or registered nurses trained and licensed to work with sick babies and children.  Beginning around 1950, students graduating from the Foundling's year-long residential program were formally known as Infant and Child Care Technicians; informally they were still often called baby nurses. They received a Foundling diploma and pin, recited the Baby Nurse Pledge and wore a nurse's uniform and cap, but were not licensed nurses.  In the late 1960's the program was renamed the School of Child Care Workers, and then the School for Infant and Child Care, with graduates continuing to wear the uniform, cap and pin. The program was phased out in 1973.</p>

            <p>The subseries contains correspondence, blank forms, clippings, and photographic prints related to the program through which children were sent by the Foundling to live with families in the country, arranged chronologically, with newsletters by the Orphan Train Heritage Society and other non-Foundling publications at the end of the subseries.  </p>
            <p>Most of the material relates either to the 1904 "Arizona Incident," in which a mob of non-Catholic Anglo families forcibly removed children from Catholic Mexican families with whom they had been placed by the Foundling, or to reunions, correspondence, or newsletters of former "orphan train riders," 1962-2002.  In between, there is one vintage photographic print of a group of orphan train riders, and one folder of blank forms.  There is no 19th century material.  Case files from the "orphan train" are in the possession of the N.Y. Foundling Hospital and are not part of this collection. </p>
            <p>Volumes from the boarding department are in Series XIV and are restricted.  For unrestricted materials, see also subseries IV. 3 - Adoption, and IV.6 - Boarding Department. There are several published volumes about the orphan train and the "Arizona Incident" in Series XVII.    </p>

            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>In 1873 the Foundling began chartering trains (now known as "orphan trains") to carry children to Catholic families in Maryland, and later to other states in the West and South.  The Foundling's placing-out program was part of a larger movement, run by many organizations from the mid-nineteenth century through the 1920s.  During this period, tens of thousands of children without families willing or able to care for them were transported out of the city to country homes, contributing to the country's westward expansion.  Most children from New York City were sent either by the Children's Aid Society (beginning in 1853) or the Foundling (beginning 20 years later).  Families receiving children from the Foundling signed a document agreeing to raise the child Catholic, and giving the institution legal right to remove the "indentured" child should the placement prove unsatisfactory.  Before children went west, they lived and attended nursery school at the Foundling.</p>

            <p>The Unit of Special Services was founded in 1973 to centralize the Foundling's residential services for children with disabilities.  In 1976 this unit became the Health Related Facility, providing medical care and a range of therapies and social services.  The program continued to evolve, and in 1987 the Sisters of Charity restructured and renamed it the Pediatric Center (aka the Medical Center for Pediatrics and Rehabilitation, or the New York Foundling Hospital Center for Pediatric, Medical, and Rehabilitative Care), an affiliate of the Foundling, located in the Foundling's building.  </p>
            <p>In 2005, now fully independent from the Foundling, the Pediatric Center was renamed the Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center.  It has continued to expand and to decentralize, while temporarily leasing space in the Foundling's building.  As it is not administered by the Foundling, the records of the Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center are not part of this collection.</p>

            <p>St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea opened on Staten Island in 1910 as an overflow center for children and mothers, to supplement the Foundling's facilities on 68th Street.  The property was a gift to the Sisters of Charity from Charles and Eugenia Schwab, and the center was at first known as "the Eugenia Schwab."  The Sisters of Charity repurposed the location as a high school in 1963. The last Foundling children left the property around 1965. </p>
            <p>The subseries includes, but is not limited to, administrative correspondence, inspection reports and legal documents, and photographic prints and other visual materials.  The records document the center from prior to its donation until after it closed as a Foundling facility, but there are no records from its current incarnation as a high school.  Folders are arranged chronologically, with miscellaneous and photographic materials at the end.  Photographic prints are also affixed to a 1935 document.</p>
            <p>Volumes created at the center, including baptism and intake books, are arranged in the St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea subseries of Series XIV - Records of Children and Mothers.  Volumes in that series are restricted.</p>

          <head>Historical Note</head>
          <p>The St. Agatha Home for Children in Nanuet, New York, was founded in 1884 by the Sisters of Charity, on 16 acres of land donated in 1875 by John Reid. Its mission was to be a home and trade school for orphans and neglected children.  Most children were referred by the New York City courts.  Over the years, land adjacent to the original property was purchased, and various buildings and wings were erected, including a building which functioned first as a "Preventorium" for sick children from 1913-1945, and later as a school.  In the 1950's and 1960's, the St. Agatha Home consisted of about two dozen buildings on about 172 acres of land.  In 1950, approximately 600 children lived there, and 358 in 1967.  </p>
          <p>Beginning in 1969, St. Agatha decentralized, operating small group homes in Rockland County, the Bronx and Staten Island, providing community-based care for youth awaiting possible foster placement.  In addition, it ran prevention programs, and opened two non-secure-detention shelters for juveniles in the criminal justice system.  In the 1970's St. Agatha's struggled financially, relying on city funds during the years of the city's fiscal crisis, while the percentage of teenagers and children with severe problems and special needs increased.  The St. Agatha Home merged into the NY Foundling Hospital in 1977.  Consolidation of two Sisters of Charity institutions providing related services would enable more effective coordinated care.</p>
          <p>After the merger, the St. Agatha Home of the New York Foundling established several new critical care programs for developmentally disabled children and adults, programs for Vietnamese boat children, and shelters for homeless youth, among other services.</p>
          <p>The latest material in this series dates from 2001.  In 2005, the St. Agatha Home closed and the property in Nanuet was sold.</p>

          <p>The series consists of one box of materials by or about directors (known variously as Administrators, Superintendents, and Executive Directors) of the New York Foundling Hospital, and members of its Advisory Board.  Materials include, but are not limited to, photographic prints, obituaries, correspondence, memos, a dissertation, clippings, and a photocopied diary.  </p>
          <p>The first 12 folders document directors who served from 1869-2003, arranged in the order in which they served as directors.  Some directors are  not represented.  These folders are followed by 4 folders documenting the Advisory Board 1869-1970's, arranged chronologically. </p>
          <p>Other materials by or about Foundling administrators may be found throughout this collection.  See especially Series I, Minutes, and Series III, Administrative Records, Chronological.  In particular, Michael Garber (Executive Director 1997-2003) wrote many reports in Series III.  For an oral history interview of Sister Cecilia Schneider, Executive Director 1966-1988, see Series IX - Histories.</p>

          <p>The series is divided into two subseries:</p>
          <p>VII.1 - Pamphlets, Appeals, Public Relations Publications, 1909-2007</p>
          <p>VII.2 - Newsletters, 1955-2009</p>
          <p><emph render="italic">VII.1</emph> includes pamphlets and other materials produced both for fundraising purposes, and to promote services to clients.  The materials promoting services describe either an array of Foundling services or else programs for which no other subseries exists in this collection.  Pamphlets for specific programs may be found in Series IV - Centers, Programs and Departments, and Series V - Records of the St. Agatha Home.  Materials are arranged chronologically.</p>
          <p><emph render="italic">VII.2</emph> includes Foundling newsletters published for external and/or internal audiences.  Some newsletters were intended for both groups.  
VII.2 begins with bound copies of <emph render="italic">Mater Dei</emph>, originally a monthly publication of the Foundling's Association of Foster Parents, although the Association's name was dropped from the banner with the April 1963 issue, possibly reflecting the newsletter's more general distribution and wide-ranging subject matter.  <emph render="italic">Mater Dei</emph> published the Foundling's Annual Report as its March issue each year from 1958-1966. </p>
          <p>For other Annual Reports and unbound copies of some of the <emph render="italic">Mater Dei</emph> Annual Report issues, see Series II - Annual Reports.  For newsletters from specific programs, see Series IV - Centers, Programs and Departments, and Series V - Records of the St. Agatha Home.</p>

          <head>Scope and Content</head>
          <p>The series contains four boxes of visual materials representing the New York Foundling Hospital circa 1880-2005.  </p>
          <p>The first three boxes contain mainly photographic prints, but there are a few photomechanical reproductions and drawings as well.  Images include building exteriors, events and people.  Most photographs were created for publicity purposes. 
The fourth box consists of negatives and positive transparencies depicting a Foundling exhibition, mounted circa 1969-1994, tracing the organization's history in photographs and other visual materials.  Most of the images in these transparencies and negatives exist in other formats (photographic prints etc.) in the first three boxes of this series, or in other series in the collection.</p>
          <p>Photographic prints are arranged roughly chronologically.  At each new main location of the Foundling, exteriors are arranged first, followed by interiors grouped in folders by subject.  The series concludes with 7 folders of material by the photographer Claire Yaffa, including photographic prints, printed photo essays, and related material such as consent forms.</p>
          <p>Hundreds of additional photographic prints can be found in other series in the collection, especially Series IV, V, and VI.  This distribution throughout the collection reflects the original order in which the materials were arranged at the Foundling.  A book about the Foundling including photographs by Claire Yaffa is part of Series XVII, Published Books.</p>

            <p>The subseries consists of 15 admissions volumes 1869-1955, including 13 consecutive volumes and 2 additional volumes with some duplicate and some additional information.  The volumes list children in the order they arrived, with each child given a new consecutive case number.   The format of the volumes changed over the years, with different information collected.  In general, the volumes give the child's name, the date of admission, date of birth, health, baptismal status, information about the parents including their religion, information about who committed the child to the Foundling, and information about the disposition of the child - his or her date of indenture, hospitalization, discharge, death, etc.</p>
            <p>Volume 73 includes, on the last pages, lists of colored boys and girls going to Kansas and Baltimore.</p>
            <p>For children listed alphabetically, see Comptroller volumes (Series XIV.5).</p>

            <p>The subseries contains 18 volumes labeled "Comptroller."  The volumes are a complete set (1874-1930) of lists of children arranged alphabetically and by year.  The volumes record each child's time in an unspecified Foundling facility and provide a final disposition (discharged, transferred, indentured, died).  These volumes complement the Children's Record volumes (Series XIV.1) which provide more detailed information.</p>

            <head>Scope and content</head>
            <p>The subseries consists of 11 volumes of patients' records, followed by 86 Birth Registry volumes, followed by 2 volumes of baptismal records from St. Ann's Maternity Hospital.</p>
            <p>The 11 volumes of patients' records are chronological records spanning 1879-1946, with a gap between 1903 December and 1921 May, and another gap between 1926 February and 1936 January.  The records 1879-1926 record the mother's name, maiden name, age, and country of birth; the father's name, age, country of birth and profession; the child's name, birthdate, and case number if applicable; a contact address; a record of payment; and sometimes the doctor's name.  The records 1936-1946 record the mother's name and age, along with a detailed medical report of the labor and birth, signed by the doctor and nurse.</p>
            <p>The 86 Birth Registry volumes contain the birth certificate stubs of children born at St. Ann's, 1881-1946. These birth certificate stubs provide the same information as the birth certificate.  The volumes are roughly chronological, with one child's certificate per page. </p>
            <p>The baptismal records span the years 1910-1934.  The first volume (1910-1926) is organized alphabetically by child.  Most of the entries are from 1910-1913, with a few added entries up to 1926.  The second volume (1926-1934) is arranged chronologically.</p>

          <p>The series consists of 12 boxes containing videotapes in various formats, DVDs, and 16mm film. Materials are arranged by format.  </p>
          <p>The VHS tapes are arranged first, and are organized numerically using numbers originally assigned by Richard Reilly at the Foundling.  Reilly further created a detailed guide to the content of each VHS cassette, which is available at the Manuscript Department of the New-York Historical Society.  The VHS tapes most often contain segments of television news and talk shows.  There are also some "home" videos of Foundling events and some promotional videos.  </p>
          <p>Other formats were not catalogued by Reilly, or viewed by any archivist, and are described in this finding aid according to their labels.</p>

          <p>The series consists of 14 books, kept by the Foundling for historical research. Twelve are published or self-published books, one is a photocopy of a published book, and one is a self-published manuscript.</p>
          <p>One book (Gottlieb/Yaffa) is about the New York Foundling Hospital as a whole.  One book (by Cardinal Spellman) is a novel about a ward of the Foundling.  Two books (Earley) are about the Sisters of Charity.  One book (Walsh) is about St. Vincent's Hospital.  Two books (Gordon and Brophy) are about the Foundling's "Arizona Incident" in 1904.  Seven other books are about the orphan train, and most of these were published via the Orphan Train Heritage Society of America. There are duplicates of some of these orphan train books, as well as related books, in the <extref xlink:actuate="none" xlink:href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/childrensaidsociety_at.html">Children's Aid Society Records, 1836-2006 (bulk 1853-1947)</extref> at the New-York Historical Society.</p>
          <p>The books are arranged alphabetically by title. </p>
