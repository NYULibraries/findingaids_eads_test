    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Joachim Hoffmann (February 22, 1908 - November 7, 1995) was born in Bremerhaven, Germany, and studied law and modern design for three years at the University of Berlin. He left Germany for Paris in 1933, where he practiced interior design for several years. In Paris Hoffmann began to work with the German interior designer Paul Bry; both men relocated to New York in the 1930s. Upon his arrival in New York City, Hoffman worked under the name Jo Kim as a designer and an art photographer both on his own and with Bry. Hoffmann's association with Bry dissolved in 1945, and he began a partnership with Stephen Heidrich in 1946.</p><p>Stephen Heidrich (March 22, 1891? - June 1972?) was born in Connecticut but educated in New York. While a high school student, he was awarded the Pierre St. Godin Medal for fine draftsmanship, and received a scholarship to Pratt Institute. He served in the U. S. Army during World War II. Upon his return to New York, Heidrich worked with interior designer Alfons Bach and then with celebrated decorator Dorothy Draper before forming the firm of Hoffmann and Heidrich.</p><p>In 1946 Hoffmann and Heidrich set up shop at 225 East 57th Street, and began doing interior design work for both commercial and residential clients. The majority of their designs were for New York City businesses and apartments, with some for larger homes in the surrounding suburban areas, and a few for commercial firms in Connecticut and Delaware. In addition to interior design work, Hoffmann and Heidrich designed display units for stores, and also designed furnishings and accessories for a variety of product lines and manufacturers.</p><p>Hoffmann and Heidrich favored a clean, uncluttered modern aesthetic. Their interiors were not dissimilar to those created by more high-end design firms at the same time. Their furniture, made for New York apartment living, was functional yet sleek. For example, tables were able to serve as both tables and benches. Their space-saving closet racks were popular. Both men were fine artists, interested in incorporating contemporary artwork into their residential designs. Both were also members of the American Institute of Designers.</p><p>Hoffmann and Heidrich's designs and interiors were featured in local and national newspapers and magazines such as the <title render="italic" type="simple">New York Times</title> and <title render="italic" type="simple">Vogue</title>, and the two often wrote articles about their designs for trade publications. By 1953 the pair were design consultants for several publications in the United States, Argentina, France, and London. In later years Hoffman gave public talks on interior design and aesthetics and taught several classes at the New School for Social Research. </p><p>Stephen Heidrich died in 1972. Hoffmann gradually stopped being an active interior designer. As late as 1980, however, he was corresponding with companies about manufacturing products to his specifications. Hoffmann died in New York City in 1995.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Kim Hoffmann collection spans the period from 1937 to 1980 and primarily contains photographs of interior and industrial designs by the interior design firm Hoffmann and Heidrich. The collection is divided into five series: Commissions; Installations and Trade Shows; Product Files; Publicity and Correspondence; and Personal Photographs.</p><p>While the collection is primarily concerned with the activity of the firm of Hoffmann and Heidrich, it also contains material associated with Paul Bry, and examples of both Hoffmann and Heidrich's individual work. Photos of individual designs are often stamped as such, i.e. "Design by Stephen Heidrich of Hoffmann and Heidrich." In addition, both Hoffmann and Heidrich created visual art, and photographs of Heidrich's sculptures and Hoffman's paintings are included here.</p><p>The collection was salvaged from the home of Kim Hoffmann after his death, and the photographs, negatives, transparencies, and clippings that were found were foldered by subject. The original folder titles have been maintained; in many cases they remain the only information available about the collected images. In cases where images were loose or clearly mislabeled, they were correctly refiled. However, there are still many images, mainly filed in "miscellaneous" folders, which remain unidentified. It is also unclear how much of the firm's work is documented by these records. Dates for many of the commissions were taken from the Hoffmann and Heidrich office addresses stamped on the verso of the photos. </p><p>Many of these photos were taken for publicity or for publication. Others were taken by Hoffmann or Heidrich themselves (especially their travel photography). Photos throughout the collection were taken by the following photographers: John Brefach, Ben Schnall, Clifford G. Scofield, Richard Averill Smith, William Stelling, and James Vincent. Particularly in Series III, product photographs were often samples distributed by their manufacturers. </p>  </scopecontent>

Many photos cannot be precisely dated, but span from roughly 1950 to 1960, the time of Hoffmann and Heidrich's most profitable period. Some folders contain no pictures of the actual design or renovation, but are merely a file of furniture or patterns collected for the project. Addresses for clients were often found in related clippings or from city phone books consulted for the year(s) of the work. All available material documenting each client is foldered together. </p><p>Folders are organized alphabetically by Hoffmann's original file titles.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref14_9ku" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Residential Commissions</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_89e29637c7ed03144ea67be105f4e83f"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Residential Commissions were undertaken mainly for urban apartments, and generally show living and dining rooms with a few kitchen and bedroom designs. The Melken Nursery is one of the few designs for children's room. Another is in the home of Dr. Margaret S. Mahler, a noted child psychoanalyst, who also requested a multifunctional headboard for her bedroom. The largest collection of photos in the subseries documents the renovation of Kurt and Lola Mann's home, from a heavy Tudor style to a modern and airy design. The file for Albert Drosin includes before and after pictures of the design work. A small apartment designed for Harriet Morrison highlights Hoffman and Heidrich's space-saving ideas and functionalist designs.</p><p>Clients represented here tended to be doctors or businessmen, but also include the novelist James Ramsey Ullman and John Everett, the president of the New School. This subseries also contains a headshot of artist Ilse Getz along with photographs of her apartment redecoration. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref15_a5r" level="otherlevel"

dining rooms, restaurants, department stores, and offices. In instances where the commercial name does not reveal the store's genre, that information is noted in brackets in the container list. Offices shown include those identified as Dubinsky, Elbert, and Factor, as well as the Book of the Month Club, and Realty Associates. Several stores sell apparel, jewelry, or furs. The design of the Paulin Toy Store in Delaware seems to be a departure from Hoffmann and Heidrich's normally staid designs. The firm also designed a conference table for Nelson Rockefeller, which is included in this subseries. Other businesses represented are the East India Curry Shop and the French Government Tourist Office in New York.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref73_g6l" level="otherlevel"

Hoffmann also designed for Grosfeld House, and created a cabinet with copper doors painted by artist Jan Hugo. </p><p>This series includes photographs of Eames furniture designs from an exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Paintings and sculptures (by Hoffmann, Ilse Getz, Lotte Jacobi, and others) are also here, both as a record of artist's work, and as ideas for home decorations. The folder entitled "Swing Table and meubles ingenieus" [sic] contains photographs of furniture pieces that embody Hoffmann and Heidrich's multifunctional aesthetic. Many of these pieces appear throughout the residential commissions. Likewise, the furniture manufactured by Willow Reed was often used by Hoffmann and Heidrich in residential designs.</p><p>Folders are arranged alphabetically by Hoffmann's original file

divided into three subseries: Articles by Hoffmann and Heidrich, Articles about Hoffmann and Heidrich, and Other Publicity and Correspondence. Some of these articles are enlarged and laminated on 18 x 11 inch boards, possibly for display.</p><p>Articles by Hoffman and Heidrich include several series of advice articles written by the pair for design trade magazines. The subseries also includes a few articles written solely by Kim Hoffmann. </p><p>Articles about Hoffman and Heidrich hail from trade publications, newspapers, and foreign periodicals. Articles which refer to individual commissions have been filed with other material relating to that commission. Those here are either general articles about the firm's design ideas, or discuss commissions not represented in the client files in the preceding series.</p><p>Other Publicity and Correspondence includes postcards sent to Hoffmann, flyers for Hoffmann's interior decorating classes at the New School, as well as several letters of reference written by psychoanalysts in support of Hoffmann's educational venture. "Your course should help your students to avoid unnecessary anxieties and compulsions which so frequently occur in the act of planning one's home," wrote Dr. Edith Jacobsen. It is likely that Hoffmann used these letters to assure students of the benefits of studying interior design with him.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref181_grf" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Articles by Hoffman and Heidrich</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref182_1tt" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Articles by Hoffman</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1952-1963</unitdate><container id="aspace_fb692dd749ed2d77e31c47511ced1f45" label="Mixed Materials [1804000043628]" type="Offsite-Box">10</container><container parent="aspace_fb692dd749ed2d77e31c47511ced1f45" type="Folder">186</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref184_mvr" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Articles by Hoffman and Heidrich in <emph render="italic">Display World</emph></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Dec. 1949-Oct. 1952</unitdate><container id="aspace_91daf3653e88c263af3a7ae83f774cc6" label="Mixed Materials [1804000043628]" type="Offsite-Box">10</container><container parent="aspace_91daf3653e88c263af3a7ae83f774cc6" type="Folder">187</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref186_n4e" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Articles by Hoffman and Heidrich in <emph render="italic">Playthings</emph></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Sep. 1955</unitdate><container id="aspace_501a8b115ea7918e900199909ff3a834" label="Mixed Materials [1804000043628]" type="Offsite-Box">10</container><container parent="aspace_501a8b115ea7918e900199909ff3a834" type="Folder">188</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref188_uxq" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Articles by Hoffman and Heidrich in <emph render="italic">Sales Talk: A Digest of the Best in Selling</emph></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Apr. 1950-Mar. 1951</unitdate><container id="aspace_c664f2f1e981cccd54ea05645da73cf5" label="Mixed Materials [1804000043626]" type="Offsite-Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_c664f2f1e981cccd54ea05645da73cf5" type="Folder">145</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref189_axq" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Articles by Hoffman and Heidrich - Miscellaneous</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1951-1953</unitdate><container id="aspace_2738de72c5492ec7898bd471eb03ed67" label="Mixed Materials [1804000043628]" type="Offsite-Box">10</container><container parent="aspace_2738de72c5492ec7898bd471eb03ed67" type="Folder">189</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref191_hcq" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Articles About Hoffmann and Heidrich</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref192_s6e" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>In <emph render="italic">Interiors &amp;
