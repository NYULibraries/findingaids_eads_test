    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Arthur Bates Jennings (1849-1927) was a New York City architect, who received his A.B. in 1870 from the College of the City of New York. He trained under such notable architects as George B. Post and Russell Sturgis, and set up his first independent office around 1876 at 71 Broadway. Early in his career, he worked mostly on residential designs; later he moved on to designs of public buildings, specializing in churches, but also working on buildings for colleges, universities, and a few private companies. Jennings moved his office several times, but always maintained a presence in lower Manhattan between the years 1876 and 1919. His business address at the time of his retirement in 1919 was 253 Broadway. While much of Jennings' early professional work was done in the New York City region, beginning in the 1890s, his multi-turreted churches and other public buildings were constructed across the United States, from Portland, Maine to Seattle, Washington. </p><p>Arthur Jennings married Caroline Jerusha Allen of West Meriden, Connecticut; the couple had three children: Edward Allen Jennings (1882-1958), Arthur B. Jennings, Jr., and Helen Bates Jennings. Arthur Jennings, Jr., became a professional organist, choirmaster, and instructor, eventually becoming a full professor at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>Dr. Edward Allen Jennings attended Wesleyan University and Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, receiving his medical degree in 1913. Dr. Jennings served on the staffs of Harlem, Fordham, and St. Luke's Hospitals in New York, was a First Lieutenant in the Army Medical Corps during World War I, and had an established medical practice in New York City. Dr. Jennings was an avid amateur historian, and researched and wrote on church architecture, local history, and his father's architectural career. He penned several book manuscripts, such as his <title render="italic">Manhattanville: An Architectural Retrospective</title>, which were never published. Dr. Jennings continued to practice medicine until his death in 1958. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Jennings Photograph Collection spans the period from circa 1858 through 1957 and contains photographs, postcards, book manuscripts, scrapbooks, and albums relating to the architectural work, professional careers, interests, and personal lives of members of the family of architect Arthur Bates Jennings. Most of the materials in the collection were gathered or compiled by Dr. Edward A. Jennings, and they reflect many of his professional and personal interests. Dr. Jennings, primarily a medical doctor, was also an amateur architectural historian and local history enthusiast. His interests are reflected in scrapbooks and book manuscripts incorporating photographs, postcards, news clippings, maps, and accompanying descriptive commentary addressing the architectural career of his father, church architecture, Short Hills, NJ, and the history of various west side neighborhoods of New York City. Additional scrapbooks relate to Dr. Jennings' own career and education; one scrapbook relates to the career of Arthur B. Jennings, Jr., a professional organist and professor. The remainder of the collection consists of photographs of various Jennings family members as well as members of the Allen family of Meriden, Connecticut, the family of Carolina Jerusha Allen Jennings.</p>  </scopecontent>

Jennings about the buildings and career of Arthur B. Jennings. The three copies are nearly identical, but a few differences exist; volume two holds more original correspondence than the other volumes, and building coverage differs slightly in each of the volumes as noted in the box listing. The book was never published. A list of buildings depicted is available in the box listing under the first copy; only the differences from copy one have been noted under copies two and three. Three folders of duplicate prints from the volumes are available at the end of the series.</p><p>Photographs are arranged in book manuscripts in their original order. They are listed here alphabetically by state, city and building name. The volume in box 1 includes a page index at the end of the volume. Dates indicate date of each building's erection, not the date the photograph was taken.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref14_4w3" level="subseries"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">Church Designs also Residence and College Buildings by Arthur B.

III. Manhattan Architecture and History consists primarily of unpublished book manuscripts with mounted photographs and clippings compiled and written by Dr. Edward A. Jennings on the history and architecture of Manhattanville, but also includes photographs and other materials relating to the Manhattan neighborhoods of Morningside Heights, Washington Heights, and the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The Manhattanville volumes were written by Dr. Jennings around 1940, incorporating research he did at the New York City Department of Records and his collection of historical photographs of the area straddling Manhattan Street (which was renamed West 125th Street in 1920). Included are descriptions of the history and landscape of the area along with depictions of local residences, including the Jennings family home, and such neighborhood institutions as Manhattan College, St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, the D.F. Tiemann &amp; Co. Color Works, the Dolly Varden Railroad Manhattanville Station, Knickerbocker Hospital, and St. Mary's Church. Copy photographs of lithographs, drawings, and maps are included in the volumes.</p><p>The remaining materials in this series depict buildings in Morningside Heights, including Columbia University, in Washington Heights near Dr. Jennings' home at the time of his death at 2 Pinehurst Avenue, and a few buildings on the Upper West Side. Also included are notes for a slide lecture on the history of Harsenville and Bloomingdale, the current Upper West Side of Manhattan.</p><p>Materials are arranged by Manhattan neighborhood and thereunder alphabetically by subject.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref148_qrx" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Manhattanville</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref149_yb2" level="item"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">Manhattanville: An Architectural Retrospective </title> by E.
