    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes 55 photographs and one poster by photographer Bob Edelson (born 1934). The images were taken in the 1970s-1980s, primarily in the New York City neighborhood of SoHo ("South of Houston Street"), with some from Greenwich Village (north of Houston Street to 14th Street) and from the area where SoHo blends into Little Italy and Chinatown. The photographs primarily capture the exterior views and signage of commercial establishments (restaurants, cafes, stores, music venues), often with direct, head-on shots, but also with wide angle views down street blocks. Pedestrians and customers sitting at sidewalk tables or at window seats frequently appear in the photographs. Wall murals and street art/graffiti are found in many of the photographs. Most of the photographs have identifiable locations through street signs or signage, though some are uncertain. None of the photographs are titled or captioned here, but most, perhaps all, are found in one of Edelson's books, which are also held by N-YHS; the books include the photographer's descriptive captions. Although most of the photographs are black and white, many are color. The container list provides more detail on sizes, color/b&amp;w, and identifiable locations.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>Bob Edelson was born 21 September 1934 in Brooklyn, NY. He earned his B.S and M.A. degrees in psychology, which led to a career of over 25 years as a marketing/creative consultant to several major consumer products companies and advertising agencies. He retired in the early 1980s, moving from New York to South Florida. Although in his retirement years Edelson began pursuing his artistic pursuit of photography more fully, he had  been a serious photographer since some time in the 1970s. His work from the 1970s and into the 1990s led to four books published with his images of streetscapes in lower Manhattan (especially the SoHo, or "South of Houston Street," neighborhood) and street art/graffiti.</p>  </bioghist>
