The Museum of Biblical Art records include curatorial, administration, and exhibition files dating from its time as the Gallery at the American Bible Society in 1997 to its closing in 2015. MoBiA was founded in order to highlight the influence that the Bible has had on art while keeping a secular distance. The majority of the records relate the museums numerous exhibitions over the years including the checklists, condition reports, clippings, and loan agreements as well as other information. There are also documents regarding the administration of the museum and its continual relationship with the American Bible Society. MoBiA closed in 2015 following financial difficulties and its inability to find a new location in New York City.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Museum of Biblical Art (MoBiA) was an institution located in New York City that sought to remain religiously neutral while pursuing its key mission of providing insight into the ways that the Bible has influenced art. It was originally created as the Gallery at the American Bible Society in 1997 with Ena Heller placed as its director. It was not until 2005 that it officially became its own independent institution and was renamed as the Museum of Biblical Art. However, despite the fact that MoBiA was a separate institution from the American Bible Society (ABS), it continued to be located within the ABS headquarters and received a large majority of its funds from ABS as well.</p>
      <p>Its first exhibition was "Coming Home! Self-Taught Artists, the Bible and the American South." Due to that fact that MoBiA did not house a permanent collection of its own, most of its exhibitions over the next decade required loans from other institutions and artists. Other exhibitions included "Biblical Art in a Secular Century," "Chagall's Bible," and "Louis C. Tiffany and the Art of Devotion." Such exhibitions included a broad range of works from several different regions and time periods. Its last exhibition was "Sculpture in the Age of Donatello: Renaissance Masterpieces from Florence Cathedral" which featured pieces that had never before been shown in the United States.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the American Bible Society moved its headquarters from New York City to Philadelphia. Since MoBiA had previously been able to rent its location in ABS for a very minimal price, the museum now found it a challenge to find a new location that it would be able to afford. Therefore, by the summer of 2015, the Museum of Biblical Art officially closed due to financial constraints.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Museum of Biblical Art records include curatorial, administration, and exhibition files from 1997 to 2015. The documents concern MoBiA's time as an independent museum from 2005 to 2015 as well as its original status as the Gallery at the American Bible Society from 1997 to 2004.</p>
      <p>Due to the fact that MoBiA had no permanent collections of its own, the majority of the files relate to the organization of exhibitions. These include loan agreements, checklists, and installation plans as well as other details regarding the realization of MoBiA's displays. The amount of records regarding each exhibition differs greatly, but the majority of the files include numerous documents concerning the acquisition of art works and their layout in the museum.  The majority of the files pertain to exhibitions organized once MoBiA became its own institution, however, there are a few items that date back to its time as the Gallery at the American Bible Society.  There are also records regarding the creation of books and symposiums to accompany some of the exhibitions.</p>
      <p>In addition, the records include information related to the administration of MoBiA. There are agendas, minutes, and meeting notes from the decade long work of the Board of Trustees. These pertain to topics such as finances, programs, and the eventual dissolution of the board in 2015. Items also concern other administrative factors of MoBiA's such as financial, strategic, and operational planning. Although the museum was officially independent from the American Bible Society, MoBiA still received many donations from ABS and was located within their New York City headquarters. Therefore, there are also files related to the relationship between the two institutions. These include financial agreements as well as lease contracts. There are also records regarding meetings in which both MoBiA and ABS discuss what type of relationship they should have and how they should move forward with it.</p>
      <p>Other materials include press clippings about both individual exhibitions and MoBiA in general as well as pamphlets, postcards, and brochures for each of the museum's exhibitions.  </p>

          <p>This series includes records related to the administration of the Museum of Biblical Art (MoBiA). There are files related to the actions of the Board of Trustees.

There are also records of each individual member of the Board of Trustees, which include financial contributions and correspondence.</p>
          <p>In addition, there are several files that concern the relationship between MoBiA and the American Bible Society (ABS).

          <p>Records pertaining to the other administrative aspects of the museum are also present. These related to MoBiA's committees which played a part in the planning of new exhibitions; the strategies that MoBiA should pursue to reach new audiences; the attempts to find a new location for the museum; and the financial goals for the institution. There are also miscellaneous reports, correspondence, and other documents related to other aspects of MoBiA's administration.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series includes records related to the planning and actualization of several exhibitions that the Museum of Biblical Art displayed. The majority of the files relate to exhibitions that were put on after MoBiA became its own organization in 2005. Therefore, there are relatively few records regarding exhibitions that were on display when it was the Gallery of the American Bible Society from 1997 to 2004. Nevertheless, the number of exhibitions following this period appears to be complete, as there are no gaps in the exhibitions until the museum closes in 2015.</p>
          <p>The amount of information regarding each exhibition varies in quantity. However, generally, most files will include the loan agreements, condition reports, checklists, exhibition contracts, shipping information, and climate reports for each exhibition. In addition, there may be label designs, research documents, wall layout plans, and installation strategies as well. There is also much correspondence related to the acquisition of certain works of art and the requests to other institutions for such pieces. If an exhibition travelled beyond its time at MoBiA, then there will be files pertaining to the planning and the condition reports related to that. </p>
          <p>Catalogues were prepared for some of the exhibitions that MoBiA organized and the files hold a copy of those. There are also records related to the development of the catalogue, including planning for works to be featured, the photos to be used, and the scholars that would participate in its publication. At times, there are also files regarding the organization of symposiums and lectures for an exhibition. If there are any unusual or significant additional items in the files, then these will be noted in the Scope and Content note at the folder level below.</p>
          <p>There are some exhibition files that include photographs, however, these are not of the actual exhibitions. Instead, the photos are largely included with condition reports in order to detail certain aspects of a piece for such reports.</p>

        <arrangement id="aspace_00859c2ef466d457a6ed3b26f734fc7e">
          <head>Arrangement</head>
          <p>The series is arranged in chronological order, based on the opening dates of each exhibition. Exhibitions that travelled passed the original dates of their showing will be placed with the folders of the initial exhibition despite their being shown at a later time. If there are records of a travelling exhibition, then this will be noted in the Scope and Content note of the folders.</p>
          <p>Files are labelled by the official exhibition titles and the actual dates of the showings. Note that some of the exhibitions were subject to changes in both titles and dates over the course of their development. In addition, some of the actual folders in the records are labelled with abbreviated versions of the exhibition titles. Therefore, it is important to note that such information in the files may not completely match their description in the finding aid. In the case of the frequent use of a differing title or date, this distinction will be acknowledged in the Scope and Content note.</p>

          <p>The contents of this series were found in file folders with no noticeable arrangement within given exhibitions. Therefore, the files in such folders remain physically unaltered and were simply moved to archival folders, leaving the majority of the files in their original folders.</p>

            <p>"Power and Piety" was not realized in the Museum of Biblical Art due to the fact that it closed shortly before the exhbition was due to begin. Therefore, the exhibition was shown in Palm Beach, Florida later in 2016.</p>

          <p>This series includes numerous press clippings regarding MoBiA's exhibitions and the museum in general. The clippings are organized into booklets depending on either their year of publication or their topic. From 2002 onwards, these booklets are increasingly organized by exhibition. It is important to note that before 2005, these clippings were usually divided into separate booklets as media logs and press clipping archives, but afterwards are organized into one booklet as a press clippings archive.</p>
