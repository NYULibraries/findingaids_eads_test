      <p>The Louisa Merritt Field Stabler family papers span the period 1818 to 1954 and consist of three linear feet of material, the majority of which is made up of correspondence between Louisa Merritt Field Stabler and her daughter, Louise Merritt Stabler Parker.  There is also a considerable amount of correspondence amongst other members of the Stabler and Parker families, though a notable amount comes from Louise Parker's great aunt Hannah of Pine Cottage, the original Field family homestead in Port Chester, Westchester County.  The collection also contains notebooks, a copy of Louisa Stabler's will, various newspaper clippings, and ephemera.  To facilitate better access to the materials, the collections has been divided into three series:</p>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Louisa Merritt Field Stabler (1826-1914) lived with her husband and children in Brooklyn Heights at 135 Willow Street.  Her husband, Edward Hartshorne Stabler (1813-1877), was a drug broker with an office at 44 Cedar Street in New York City.  His commercial specialty was opium, at that time an import from Asia. He was originally from Baltimore and after his move to Brooklyn, his business never recovered.  The Stablers' children included a daughter, Louise Merritt (1868-1954), and a son, Edward.  The Stablers were Quakers with strong ties to the Brooklyn Meeting House and Mission, the Young Friends Society, and the Friends Seminary.  The Stabler family was also highly involved with education on all levels, from local kindergartens to universities. The family had connections to Columbia College, and contributed financial support to the establishment of Barnard College, at the time one of the few institutions in the country to offer a college education to women.</p>
      <p>The Stablers' daughter, Louise Merritt Stabler, graduated from Brooklyn Heights Seminary in 1886 and taught there before attending Barnard College.  She was a member of the first graduating class of Barnard College in 1893.  She later became active in the suffrage movement, and was involved with the League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1894, she married zoologist George Howard Parker (1864-1955), a professor at Harvard College and a member of the American Physiological Society.  The Parkers lived in North Cambridge, MA at 6 Avon Place.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series comprises the bulk of the collection and contains extensive correspondence from Louisa Stabler to her daughter, Louise Parker.  Stabler's letters create a continuous narrative from 1886 until her death in 1914, and offer insight into the culture of upper-middle class life in Brooklyn Heights at the turn of the century.  More importantly, the letters richly illustrate a closeness between mother and daughter during a time of change.  The mother stayed at home but fostered education for women in general and her daughter in particular, and as she did so she filled her frequent and affectionate letters to her daughter with news of neighborhood events and cultural activities in Brooklyn.  She also offered advice on housekeeping, touching upon fabric samples, cooking, and managing servants.  The whole correspondence is one portion of a discourse between mother and daughter that not only illustrates traditional parental values, but also reveals the dramatic social and cultural changes in the late 19th-century United States, the economic power of wealthy females, advocacy of education for females, and the expansion of opportunities for women while nurturing traditional values between generations.</p>
