      <p>John Kissam (1748-1828) was a farmer in Flower Hill, a village in Queens County (N.Y.) at the time, but becoming part of North Hempstead, Nassau County, in the twentieth century. During the American Revolution, Kissam was a Loyalist and was given the rank of major in the Queens County Militia on December 9, 1776, during the British occupation of New York and Long Island. On June 30, 1781, he was kidnapped from his home by revolutionaries and taken to Connecticut. He was paroled and then exchanged for another prisoner in October 1981. Back on Long Island, he continued in the militia. Among other services, he oversaw the delivery of wood from Long Islanders at the order of the British authorities. At the close of the war, Kissam left for Nova Scotia, but returned to Long Island by 1786. He was Clerk of the Board of Supervisors of Queens County from 1797 to 1820. He also served as a vestryman in St. George's Episcopal Church in Hempstead and a warden at Christ Church in Manhasset.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>The documents in this collection were received by the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) along with various objects in 1959. In 1968 the documents were separated from the objects and foldered as individual items. At some point, likely around 1996, the items were refoldered by correspondent or subject. In 2012, the collection was described by Larry Weimer.</p>

      <p>The John Kissam papers principally include correspondence and orders, dating from 1778-1781, to Major Kissam concerning the Queens County (N.Y.) Militia during the American Revolution.

There are a small number of post-war items concerning Kissam including a receipt book (1787-1806), a statement by a Mr. Hart (likely rector Seth Hart of Christ Church, Hempstead) regarding his financial difficulties (undated), and a referral to Kissam of a candidate for the church at North Hempstead (1823).</p>
      <p>The collection also includes election (1865) and discharge (1868) certificates for Corporal Platt Wiggins from the New York State National Guard. The collection includes the August 1864 muster roll of Company K of the 12th Georgia Infantry Regiment, Confederate States of America.</p>
