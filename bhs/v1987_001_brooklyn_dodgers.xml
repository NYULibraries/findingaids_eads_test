      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The Brooklyn Dodgers were a baseball team based in Brooklyn and founded in 1883. Between 1883 and 1931, the team that would become the Brooklyn Dodgers went through numerous monikers including the Bridegrooms, the Superbas, the Robins, and the Trolley Dodgers--purportedly coined for Brooklynites ability to dodge the dangerous streetcars in Brooklyn. In 1913, the team moved to a new home field, Ebbets Field, and the next year hired Manager Wilbert Robinson (hence the name the Brooklyn Robins) who would become the winningest manager in the teams' history. After 18 years at the helm, Robinson retired as manager in 1931. The following year, in 1932, the team officially became the Brooklyn Dodgers and remained so until the end of 1957 season, when the team was moved to Los Angeles. </p>
      <p>Throughout the teams' history, under various names, the team won the National League Pennant nine times between 1916 to 1957. The Brooklyn Dodgers also made history by being the first team to sign a black player into the modern major leagues--Jackie Robinson. Originally signed to the Dodgers minor league team, the Montreal Royals, in October of 1945, Robinson was brought up to the majors in 1947, where he subsequently earned the Rookie of the Year award that same year. Although the team played in the World Series nine times, they won the World Series only once in 1955. Regardless, the teams' fans were nearly as renowned at the team itself, known for their antics and loyalty. In 1958, the Brooklyn Dodgers became the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ebbets Field was demolished in 1960.</p>

      <p>The Brooklyn Dodgers photographs consist of five black-and-white photographic prints dating from 1949 to 1956. The photographs are attributed to the news agency United Press International (UPI). Included are two photographs of Jackie Robinson--one of Robinson sitting alone in the dugout and the other capturing Robinson stealing home against catcher Yogi Berra during the opening game of the 1955 World Series between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees. The collection also includes a photographic portrait of pitcher Hank Casey; a team photograph of the Dodgers in front of Borough Hall in Brooklyn after winning the National League pennant in 1949; and a photograph of Dodgers' fans waiting on line to buy tickets for the World Series after the Dodgers won the National League pennant in 1956.</p>
