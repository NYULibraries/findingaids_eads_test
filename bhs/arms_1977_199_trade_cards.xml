      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>Trade cards were an early form of advertisement that began appearing in the early 18th century and peaked in popularity in the late 19th century. The cards were mass produced, often in color, and distributed by retailers. Most trade cards advertised a good or product, providing insight into material culture, marketing, and business during the era. Because of their small size and vivid illustrations, trade cards became a popular item for collectors and were often saved in scrapbooks.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Brooklyn and New York City trade card scrapbooks date from 1880 to 1889 and measure 1.13 linear feet. The collection consists of three scrapbooks that contain color trade card advertisements. The trade cards represent both businesses in Brooklyn and New York City--including clothiers, tailors, jewelers, and shoe stores--and household products such as soap, cotton, and elixers. Interspersed among the trade cards are drawings and ephemera such as animal portraits, valentines, and greeting cards.</p>
