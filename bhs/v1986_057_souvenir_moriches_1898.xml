      <p>The <emph render="italic">Souvenir of Moriches, 1898</emph> viewbook contains black-and-white non-photographic prints of photographs depicting an area of the hamlet of Moriches, called Centre Moriches, that is located in Suffolk County, Long Island. The view book was published by Frederick F. Purdy, a real estate agent, surveyor, and conveyancer, for the purpose of promoting real estate located in Centre Moriches for sale or for rent, as well as to promote the quality of life of Centre Moriches as a residential destination. The viewbook contains images of hotels, churches, and pastoral and beach views, as well as informational and historical descriptions of the area. A Long Island Railroad time table between Long Island City in Queens, N.Y. and Centre Moriches is also included. The pages of the viewbook are brittle and have separated from the binding.</p>

      <p>Moriches is a hamlet located in Suffolk County, Long Island. It is comprised of three areas, Centre Moriches, East Moriches, and Moriches proper. Long Island, the 118-mile-long island located in southeastern New York State and just east of the island of Manhattan, is comprised of four counties: Suffolk County, Nassau County, Queens County, and Kings County. Suffolk County, occupying the eastern-most portion of Long Island, is by far the largest of the four counties by area and is known for its rich, fertile farmland and vast coastline.</p>
