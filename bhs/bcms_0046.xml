      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection consists of the handwritten birth register and typewritten professional permit of a Brooklyn midwife, Catherine Ling. The register is a canvas-bound volume with leather corners; about one tenth of the pages are filled with records of home births in Brooklyn (and some in Manhattan) delivered by midwife Catherine Ling.</p>
      <p> Each record contains the name of a newborn, the day and date of birth, home address, names of the parents, their addresses, ages, places of birth and occupations as well as total number of living children in the household. Most records also contain a birth certificate number which appears in the ledger as an "R.h." Some records contain additional information, such as the race of the child, mother's maiden names, unusual health conditions, midwife's fees, and the name of the doctor who issued the birth certificate.</p>
      <p> The collection also includes an undated professional permit issued to midwife Catherine Ling by the Department of Health of the City of New York, Bureau of Child Hygiene.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The birth records in this volume are interspersed between stretches of blank pages, presumably left to accommodate future records. The records are arranged alphabetically within the volume and roughly chronologically within each alphabetical section. There is an alphabetical index at the beginning of the volume and a loosely-arranged chronological index at the end of the volume, starting on page 500.</p>
