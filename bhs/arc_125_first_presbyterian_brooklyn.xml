      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The First Presbyterian Church of Brooklyn (commonly referred to as First Church) was founded in 1822.  Its building on Cranberry Street, featuring a distinct 120-foot clock tower, was the first church to be built in Brooklyn Heights.  In 1846, First Church's building was purchased by Plymouth Church, and First Church moved to a property on Henry Street between Pierrepont and Clark Streets.</p>
      <p>First Church had a number of distinguished pastors throughout the 19th century.  One such pastor was Dr. Samuel Hanson Cox, who served from 1837 to 1854.  Cox led First Church through a period known as the "Presbyterian schism," in which controversy erupted among American Presbyterians over a number of theological issues, the prospect of merging with the Congregationalists, and the moral implications of slavery.  Cox, regarded as "Brooklyn's first abolitionist," asserted that God's salvation was open to all regardless of race and allied himself with the more progressive Presbyterian sect known as the New School.  Cox's stance aroused suspicion from more traditionalist members of First Church, many of whom subsequently withdrew to join other churches or establish their own (most notably the Church of the Pilgrims).  Still, membership at First Church under Cox's leadership remained strong.</p>
      <p>Dr. Charles Cuthbert Hall, who served as pastor from 1877 to 1897, is also a notable figure in the history of First Church, having been largely responsible for revitalizing the church in a time when it faced declining membership and severe debt.  Hall brought in over 800 new members, increased revenues beyond expectations, made significant changes to the interior of the church, brought in the gifted organist and choir director Raymond Huntington Woodman (who served for over 70 years), and generally established First Church to a place of prominence in the Brooklyn community.  Hall later became President of Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan.</p>
      <p>Despite varying periods of decline in the 20th century brought on by dwindling finances, low membership, and unstable economic and social conditions, First Church persisted and established a unique identity in the Brooklyn community.  It underwent several architectural renovations and additions, embraced its role as a shelter for the sick and needy, engaged in social action, and fostered an increasingly multicultural congregation.  As of 2010, First Church continues to serve the Brooklyn community from its Henry Street location and is led by Reverend Stephen Phelps, who is serving in the capacity of Interim Senior Pastor.</p>
