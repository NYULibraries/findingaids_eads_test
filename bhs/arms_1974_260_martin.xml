      <p>Charles C. Martin (1831-1903) was born in Springfield, PA and attended the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., from which he graduated as a civil engineer in 1836.  Martin later relocated to Brooklyn, N.Y., where he worked as an engineer at the Brooklyn Navy Yard during the Civil War and was chief engineer of the construction of the Atlantic Docks and Prospect Park.  Martin then worked as assistant engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge from 1870 until the bridge's opening in 1883, and later became Chief Engineer and Superintendent of the bridge.  Martin remained involved with the maintenance of the Brooklyn Bridge in varying capacities until his death.</p>
