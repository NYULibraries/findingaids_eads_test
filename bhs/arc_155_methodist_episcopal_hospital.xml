These documents feature summaries of the hospital's activities and accomplishments for each year, the names of donors and donations made, as well as summaries of the hospital's financial standing for each year. The collection also includes a handful of programs for events benefitting the hospital, dated 1966 and 1967, as well as copies of its charter and bylaws, dated 1888, 1897, and 1905.</abstract>

      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>In 1881, the Reverend James Monroe Buckley, editor of the periodical <emph render="italic">The Christian Advocate</emph>, made an appeal to the publication's Methodist readership to contribute to the establishment of a new hospital that would help to address the health concerns of Brooklyn's rapidly growing population. Buckley's appeal was answered by prominent banker George Ingraham Seney, who contributed $100,000 and several plots of land to begin construction of the hospital, and to incorporate the institution. The hospital was incorporated on May 27, 1881, and opened on December 19, 1887 at the corner of 6th Street and 7th Avenue in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. Originally housed in three buildings with a staff of 16, Methodist Episcopal Hospital grew steadily throughout the 20th century, and as of 2010 it comprises a sprawling complex of buildings with a staff of several hundred. In the 1990s, the institution's name was officially changed to New York Methodist Hospital.</p>
