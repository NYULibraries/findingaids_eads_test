During the park's construction, Culyer was charged by the park's commission to oversee the development of the park's public uses. He also oversaw the construction of Ocean Parkway, the Concourse at Coney Island, and was involved in the construction of several railroads in Brooklyn. Culyer was an eyewitness to the assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln.</abstract>
