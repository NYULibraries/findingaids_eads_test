      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Tide-Water Building Company collection dates from 1910 to 1919, with the bulk of materials dated 1910 to 1911, and contains approximately 80 items. Document types in the collection include photographs, clippings, periodicals, and advertisements. </p>
      <p>A large portion of the collection documents Tide-Water's construction of a section of the 4th Avenue subway line in Brooklyn. The construction project spans 10th to 28th Streets along 4th Avenue in the Gowanus, Park Slope, and Sunset Park neighborhoods of Brooklyn. Photographs show the excavation of underground tunnels, tunnel bracing, and dividers between express and local tracks. Views are from track level, street level, and overhead. Construction workers and steam-driven equipment are depicted. Photographs also show bracing and infrastructure at the Prospect Avenue subway station and platform. Images are identified by cross streets, cardinal direction, and date.</p>
      <p>In addition to 4th Avenue subway photographs, the collection also includes photographs and printed material showing other Tide-Water construction projects. Construction projects are located in New York City, Connecticut, and Ohio, among other locations. Each photograph, periodical, advertisement, or clipping is identified by project or building name and location. Building specifications for two frame houses on Caton Avenue in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, also built by Tide-Water, are included.</p>
