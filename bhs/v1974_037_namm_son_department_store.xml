      <p>Namm's Department Store was founded by Adolph I. Namm, a Prussian immigrant to New York City,</p>
      <p>A.I. Namm &amp; Son Department Store was founded by Adolph I. Namm, a Polish immigrant to New York City. In 1885, Namm moved his upholstery business from Manhattan to Brooklyn, eventually settling on Fulton Street between Hoyt Street and Elm Place in 1891. The Fulton Street building expanded as Namm's business grew into a department store in the early 20th century, eventually covering most of the block and becoming the flagship store of A. I. Namm &amp; Son Department Store. In 1957, the Fulton Street complex of A.I. Namm &amp; Son Department Store closed. The existing portion of the Namm building, 450-458 Fulton Street at the corner of Hoyt Street, received landmark status in 2005.</p>
