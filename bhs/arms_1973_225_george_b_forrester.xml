      <p>This collection spans the period 1847 to 1932 and consists of fliers, programs, and additional ephemera relating to several religious organizations in Brooklyn, including the Baptist Home of Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Baptist Social Union, the Brooklyn Sunday School Union, the Tabernacle Baptist Church, and the Woman's Baptist Missionary Society, among others.  Additional ephemera pertains to Brooklyn fraternal organizations, such as the Freemasons' Altair Lodge No. 601 and the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) U.S. Grant Post No. 327, as well as a number of public schools.  Certain social events, such as the George Washington Inaugural Ball, the Memorial Day ceremony at Ulysses S. Grant's tomb, dinners and banquets held in honor of Brooklyn Mayor Charles A. Schieren, and various concerts are represented as well.  Also included are several illustrated prints of scenes in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery.  The collection is believed to have been assembled by George B. Forrester, and contains a letter from the GAR U.S. Grant Post No. 327 to Forrester's wife commenting upon his death in 1906.</p>
