      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Henry Reed Stiles (1832-1909) was a physician who authored a number of historical and genealogical works in the second half of the nineteenth and into the early twentieth centuries, including the 3 volume <emph render="italic">A History of the City of Brooklyn</emph> (1867-1870). Though his medical career took him to places as disparate as Dundee, Scotland and Woodbridge, New Jersey, Stiles lived most of his life in New York City and in Brooklyn. He was a founder of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) in 1863 and served as the Society's first librarian. Further biographical information on Stiles can be found at his Wikipedia entry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Reed_Stiles.</p>
