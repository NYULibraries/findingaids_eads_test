      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The Brooklyn Art Club was an art society for professional artists. Organized in 1878 and incorporated in 1890, the Brooklyn Art Club held annual exhibitions for both the exhibition and sale of art work created by Club members. Membership was open to both men and women. The exhibitions were held at Sherk's Galleries located at 435 Fulton Street, in what is now the neighborhood of Downtown Brooklyn, and later at the Art Association Galleries on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights.</p>
