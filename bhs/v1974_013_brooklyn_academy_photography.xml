      <p>The Brooklyn Academy of Photography Washington centennial photographs date from 1889 and contain 670 items. The collection includes photographs of Manhattan and Brooklyn taken by Brooklyn Academy of Photography members during the Washington centennial parade and related festivities. The bulk of the photographs show the parade route in lower Manhattan, especially Wall and Broad Streets, with bystanders, marching groups, and President Benjamin Harrison's convoy. The collection also documents a procession of ships in the East River and New York Harbor which commemorated Washington's arrival in New York by boat, as well as views of the Manhattan festivities from Brooklyn Heights. Street views of Brooklyn Heights and Downtown Brooklyn show the neighborhoods and buildings decorated for the celebration. Most photographs are identified by photographer's last name, though few other identifying details are provided.</p>

      <p>On April 30, 1889, the United States celebrated the centennial anniversary of the inauguration of President George Washington. In New York City--the site of the U.S. Capitol at the time of Washington's inauguration--the most prominent event was a parade led by President Benjamin Harrison, which traced Washington's inauguration day route from the New York Harbor through Manhattan to Federal Hall on Wall Street. New Yorkers also hosted pageants and banquets for the occasion.</p>
