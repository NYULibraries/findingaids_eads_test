      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The New York State Society of Professional Engineers was the founding state society of the National Society of Professional Engineers. The Bronx County Chapter, New York State's first chapter, was founded in 1926, followed by the Kings County Chapter in 1928. The Society's mission was to provide engineers with professional development and economic opportunities. The Kings County Chapter held regular monthly meetings at the Brooklyn Engineers' Club, located on Remsen Street in Brooklyn Heights. During the time period covered in this collection, membership grew steadily, from 1600 members in 1949 to 2200 members in the late 1950s.</p>
