Included in the papers are correspondence and other printed materials. The bulk of the correspondence concerns a dinner in McDonald's honor in 1904, and several were written to congratulate McDonald upon his election as President of Nassau National Bank. Materials related to a dinner honoring McDonald's 40 years of service to Nassau National Bank include a program, an invitation, and a seating arrangement. The collection also includes a promissory note from Horatio Fisher to John Ackerman, dated 1888; two printed poems; newspaper clippings of McDonald's obituary; and miscellaneous invitations, programs, and calling cards.</abstract>
