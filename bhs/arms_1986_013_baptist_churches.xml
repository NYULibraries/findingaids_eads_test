      <p>The Baptist faith was practiced as early as the 17th and 18th centuries in the territories and colony that today constitute New York. However, a Baptist house of worship did not come to Brooklyn until 1823, with the founding of the First Baptist Church (later known as the Baptist Temple). In 1847, the first African-American Baptist church in Brooklyn, Concord Baptist Church of Christ, was founded. Baptists were one of the largest denominations in the City of New York during the mid-19th century, continuing to grow with the influx of immigrants into the 20th century.</p>
