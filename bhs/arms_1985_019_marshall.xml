      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>William Marshall (1813-1895) was born in Belfast, Ireland.  He emigrated to America with his parents at age three, and the family lived in Wilmington, DE for four years. In 1820, the family moved to Brooklyn, N.Y., where they settled. Marshall's first job was at the Ropewalk of the John Thursby Company. In 1835, Marshall aided in the formation of L. Waterbury &amp; Company, and through his careful supervision of the company's operation, it became successful. During his administrative years at L. Waterbury &amp; Company, William Marshall became active in other business ventures, and established the Williamsburg City Fire Insurance Company in March of 1853. He served on the Boards of Directors of several companies, including the Mechanics' Bank of Brooklyn, People's Gas Light Company, the Long Island Traction and Brooklyn Heights Railroad Company, and the Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad Company.  Marshall continued his involvement with L. Waterbury &amp; Company until 1887, when his son, Chauncey Marshall, and James M. Waterbury, son of the late L. Waterbury, took control of the business.</p>
      <p>Marshall resided at the corner of 296 Clinton and Greene Avenues for 50 years with his wife, Jane Montgomery, whom he married in 1839. Their four children were Martha A. Place, William Marshall, Jr., George Marshall, and Chauncey Marshall. William Marshall died on June 9, 1895 and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery.</p>
