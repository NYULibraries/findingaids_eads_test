      <p>The Victor M. Drake papers on the U.S.S. Monitor consist of several documents, primarily concerning the <emph render="italic">Monitor</emph>'s crew.

These lists also identify crew members who were residents of Brooklyn. Also included are two newspaper clippings; one dates from 1953 and discusses the history of the Battle of Hampton Roads, and the other dates from circa 1861 and announces the commissioning of the <emph render="italic">Monitor</emph> by the United States Navy. The papers were created and compiled by Drake during the 1950s.</p>
