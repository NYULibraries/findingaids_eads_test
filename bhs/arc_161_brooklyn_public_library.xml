      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The formation of the Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) system was approved by the New York State legislature in 1892 and was officially organized in 1897, just one year before the consolidation of New York City. The BPL system was originally planned as a network of small libraries with the first branch library opening in 1897 at the former Public School No. 3 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. From 1901 to 1923, the BPL system grew rapidly when steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie provided funds ($1.6 million) for the construction of 21 new branch libraries throughout Brooklyn. Carnegie libraries, as they were generally called, were unique in that they were designed to meld beautiful architecture with functional design. Further, to receive Carnegie's funding, a library or library system had to both provide the land on which the library would be built and must also be able to pay for operational and maintenance costs following construction. </p>
      <p>Around the same time as when the Carnegie libraries were being built in Brooklyn, the BPL system also embarked on the establishment and construction of a grand central library. In 1908, BPL hired Brooklyn-born architect Raymond F. Almirall (1869-1939) to design the new central library building. Construction on a classical style Beaux-Arts building progressed until funding difficulties halted construction in 1913. Though the foundation of the building had been dug and the frame of one wall was in place, funding problems prohibited further work on the construction of BPL's central branch. It wasn't until 1938, when a new architecture firm, Alfred Morton Githens and Francis Keally, was hired to redesign a new central library, incorporating Almirall's original foundation and framing (that still stood) as the basis for the new design. On February 1, 1941 the new Modern Classical style Central Library finally opened to public. </p>
      <p>As of 2010, the BPL system consisted of 60 locations including the Central Library, the Business Library (located on the border of the Brooklyn Heights and Downtown Brooklyn neighborhoods), and 58 branch libraries located throughout Brooklyn (18 of which are Carnegie libraries). The BPL system also ranked as the fifth largest library system in the United States, with the Central Library seeing over one million visitors at its Grand Army Plaza location on the northern edge of Prospect Park.</p>

      <p>The Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) publications span the years 1898 to 1965 and are housed in six and one half manuscript boxes. Materials represented in the collection include annual reports; bulletins; newsletters; book lists (bibliographies); and miscellaneous programs, publications, and ephemera.</p>
      <p>Box 1 contains: BPL annual reports for the years 1898 to 1906, 1908 to 1911, 1921 to 1927, 1929 to 1930, 1932 to 1950, 1952 to 1958, and 1961 to 1965. Also included is one publication, <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Public Library Staff Association Benefit for Scholarship Fund</emph>, dated November 1, 1941. The annual reports generally include a list of the Board of Directors (including their home addresses); lists of committees and committee members; names of library staff; laws and proceedings relating to the establishment of BPL; reports from the chief librarian and from various library departments; library statistics for individual library branches; and financial reports.

The <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> was published monthly (except for the months August and September) and contained general library information (such as the names of the Board of Directors, locations of library branches, and library rules and regulations) and lists of newly acquired books. Box 2 also contains several issues of the <emph render="italic">Author Index</emph> for the years 1901 to 1903, including the first issue published in February 1901.</p>
