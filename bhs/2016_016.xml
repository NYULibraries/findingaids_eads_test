      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>Minimally processed to the collection level.  Negatives were removed by the processing archivist from the original envelopes used by Edward B. Watson and placed in archival envelopes.  The archival envelopes were numbered by the processing archivist to reflect the order of the original envelopes in the box comprising the collection that was returned by the New York Transit Museum in 2016.  In cases in which an original envelope contained a large number of negatives, the processing archivist put the negatives into multiple archival envelopes, which were numbered to reflect the fact that the negatives came from one original envelope (e.g., "1a, 1b, 1c").  The original envelopes were attached to the corresponding archival envelopes using paperclips in order to preserve the information written upon them about the negatives by Edward B. Watson.</p>
