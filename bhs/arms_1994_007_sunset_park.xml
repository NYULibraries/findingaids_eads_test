Among the topics that are explored in the interviews are tensions between different groups of Chinese immigrants, crime and safety in the neighborhood, Sunset Park's relationship to Manhattan's Chinatown, and how long-term residents of Sunset Park had adjusted to the area's "newcomers."</abstract>

      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The New Neighbors: Sunset Park's Chinese Community oral history project began as a joint effort between Brooklyn Historical Society and the Chinatown History Museum (now the Museum of Chinese in America), with a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities and additional funding from the Ford Foundation. Awarded in 1992, the grant endeavored to explore how the new community of Chinese immigrants centered at Brooklyn's Eighth Avenue took root and blossomed during the 1980s. By the early 1990s, the community boasted a population of approximately 60,000 people and was known as New York City's third Chinatown. </p>
      <p>The project's initial co-directors, Ellen M. Snyder-Grenier of the Brooklyn Historical Society and Mary Ting Yi Lui of the Chinatown History Museum designed the project to create primary documentation of the new ethnic community at a moment when many of its pioneers were still in place. They hoped to answer who these settlers were, and what political and economic forces brought them to Brooklyn. They could find no other materials which directly answered these questions, and believed this study to be the first of its kind in New York City. </p>
      <p>By July of 1993, the project's staff had restructured to include coordinator Gregory Ruf and lead interviewer Ka-Kam Chui. Fabiana Chiu of Brooklyn Historical Society provided additional assistance in interviews. </p>
      <p>Cantonese-language interviews were translated and transcribed primarily by Ka-Kam Chui and representatives from the Chinatown History Museum, and exist in handwritten form. English-language interviews were transcribed, and exist in typed form. </p>
      <p>For specific information on language please see the scope and content note below for each interview. For the availability of handwritten original-language transcripts for individual interviews, please see transcripts in Box 2. </p>
      <p>The oral history project concluded in June of 1996. The New Neighbors: Sunset Park's Chinese Community public exhibitions at both Brooklyn Historical Society and the Chinatown History Museum displayed the oral histories, photographs, and a narrative.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Brooklyn Historical Society, in partnership with the Chinatown History Museum, initiated the New Neighbors: Sunset Park's Chinese Community Oral History project in 1993. Using funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Ford Foundation, twenty-nine interviews were conducted documenting the experiences of both Chinese and non-Chinese community members whose homes clustered around Eighth Avenue in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. Chinese and non-Chinese members of the community were interviewed. While the ethnically-Chinese narrators were chosen to represent both early (pre-1985) and late (post-1985) waves of immigration, non-Chinese narrators were chosen to represent the different ethnic communities who shared the neighborhood with -- or had been displaced by -- the new arrivals. This included people of Latino, Norwegian, and Italian heritage. </p>
      <p>This collection includes recordings and transcripts of interviews conducted between March of 1993 and June of 1994. Eleven interviews were conducted in English; fifteen were conducted in Cantonese; and three were conducted in Mandarin. Mary Ting Yi Lui and Ka-Kam Chui performed interviews in Cantonese and English; Gregory Ruf conducted interviews in Mandarin and English. Fabiana Chiu aided on one interview which was conducted with assistance in Spanish. The oral histories often contain descriptions of immigration, living arrangements, neighborhood ethnicities, discrimination, employment, community development, political leadership, petty and organized crime, and adjustment to American life. Also included is a small sampling of newspaper clippings, brochures, and administrative documentation of the project's development, management, and exhibition.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection contains the digitized content of twenty-nine interviews, digitized and print transcripts in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin (with English translations where applicable), and printed administrative documentation of the project's development, management, and exhibition. The collection is arranged thematically into 3 series: 1) Oral histories; 2) Oral History Transcripts; 3) Administrative Materials. Interview recordings were originally made on compact cassette tapes and are housed separately.</p>
      <p><emph render="bolditalic">Series 1: Oral Histories</emph> makes up the bulk of the collection. There is audio for each of the twenty-nine interviews, all conducted for the original scope of the project. A complete listing of each interview with a biographical note, scope and content note, and controlled access headings follows. Interviews are also described in the Past Perfect archives catalog, including the audio and transcription where available. Digitized oral histories in Series 1 are in alphabetical order by narrator name.</p>
      <p><emph render="bolditalic">Series 2: Oral History Transcripts </emph>contains handwritten and typed transcripts for each of the twenty-nine interviews, including those in Mandarin and Cantonese along with an English-language translation for most. For a complete listing of translations, participants, and dates of the interview, please see the Interview Lists folder in box 2. Abstracts of the interviews are also included in this series. Folders are organized alphabetically by narrator name. Each folder contains all available transcripts for that interview. When available, digitized transcripts are attached to relevant records in Past Perfect's archives catalog. Contents of box 2 were inventoried and remain unprocessed.</p>
      <p><emph render="bolditalic">Series 3: Administrative Materials </emph>includes all retained materials that went into the funding and implementation for Brooklyn Historical Society and Chinatown History Museum project and exhibition. Materials are arranged as they were found; with separate files pertaining to grant funding, project planning, research, hiring, printed ephemera related to Sunset Park's Chinese community, and choice of narrators. This series has not been inventoried or processed.</p>

      <head>Oral History note</head>
      <p>Oral history interviews are intimate conversations between two people, both of whom have generously agreed to share these recordings with the Brooklyn Historical Society archives and with researchers. Please listen in the spirit with which these were shared. Researchers will understand that:</p>
      <p>1. The Brooklyn Historical Society abides by the General Principles and Best Practices for Oral History as agreed upon by the Oral History Association (2009) and expects that use of this material will be done with respect for these professional ethics.</p>
      <p>2. Every oral history relies on the memories, views and opinions of the narrator. Because of the personal nature of oral history, listeners may find some viewpoints or language of the recorded participants to be objectionable. In keeping with its mission of preservation and unfettered access wherever possible, BHS presents these views as recorded.</p>
      <p>3. Transcripts created prior to 2008 serve as a guide to the interview and are not considered verbatim. The audio recording should be considered the primary source for each interview. It may contain natural false starts, verbal stumbles, misspeaks, and repetitions that are common in conversation, and other passages and phrases omitted from the transcript. This decision was made because BHS gives primacy to the audible voice and also because some researchers do find useful information in these verbal patterns.</p>
      <p>4. Unless these verbal patterns are germane to your scholarly work, when quoting from this material researchers are encouraged to correct the grammar and make other modifications maintaining the flavor of the narrator's speech while editing the material for the standards of print.</p>

            <p>Born in 1964 to a land-owning family of the educated elite, the narrator's family fortune was reversed during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. At twenty-two, she immigrated to America to attend Clarion University in Pennsylvania. After graduation she moved to New York City and found a job as a librarian in Brooklyn. She later married a Chinese man and helped her parents and sister immigrate to New York City from Toronto, Canada. At the time of the interview, the narrator felt stuck between two cultures; both of which she loved.</p>

            <p>In this interview, the narrator discusses Chinese assimilation to American culture by contrasting her own experiences with those of her younger sister and of her parents. She notes class and lifestyle differences among the different Chinese immigrants of New York City and delineates them by their home provinces, their education levels, their native language, and "old" versus "new" immigrants, while also considering "ABCs" or American-Born Chinese. She discusses ethnic tensions between Chinese American and Hispanic American neighbors in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. The narrator also states that she feels she has become culturally American. Interview conducted by Gregory Ruf.</p>

            <p>The narrator was born circa 1950 in Taishan, Mainland China. After a brief stay in Hong Kong, her family settled in Saigon, Vietnam, where she lived for thirty years. As an adult, she worked, married, and had five children. The family lived comfortably until the Vietcong conquered South Vietnam and took possession of her family's considerable financial portfolio. Forced to flee, the narrator and her children were granted refugee status in America and settled in Brooklyn. She started numerous entrepreneurial pursuits, including a real estate business.

            <p>In this interview, the narrator relates her life story with a backdrop of generations of her family's history. She describes Vietnam; living in Saigon, the Vietcong takeover, her family's process of fleeing, and immigrating to America as a refugee.

            <p>The son of an Italian father and an Italian-American mother, Louis Castaldo (nickname Lou) was thirty-nine years old in 1994. Castaldo grew up in Brooklyn. During his childhood, he lived in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn and attended public schools within the area. In the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, Castaldo's father, Vinnie, bought and ran Vinnie's Pizzeria as a family business from 1970 onward. Castaldo worked alongside his father at the pizzeria from his early teen years to the time of the interview in 1994.</p>

            <p>In this interview, Lou Castaldo discusses his father's business; Vinnie's Pizzeria was established during the early 1970s in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. He recounts his father's coming to America and life before starting the business. Castaldo describes the various ethnic cultures and neighborhoods he observed while growing up in Brooklyn; including significant events, activities, hobbies, family life and traditions. Castaldo recalls a significant period of change in Sunset Park, beginning in 1979; from a European American neighborhood comprised of Germans, Greeks, Irish, Italians, and Norwegians to an Asian American neighborhood, largely of Chinese heritage. He evaluates other influences that factored into the changing neighborhood; escalating crime rates and drug use, business closures, new Chinese American ownership of businesses and housing, cultural differences and language barriers, and national politics supporting or allowing illegal aliens to enter and live in the United States. He surveys the Sunset Park community's actions to create a more global and shared sense of community—a melting pot of cultures. Interview conducted by Gregory Ruf.</p>

In 1985 Chan opened Prosperity Video, the first Chinese-language movie rental store in the Chinatown area within the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, because she realized she could care for her new baby while running the shop.

While working three hundred sixty-four days a year at the shop, in the evenings she was an active parent with a particular interest in her children's progress at school.

            <p>Wong Lai Chow was born in 1920 in Guangzhou of mainland China. Although her parents moved to America when Chow was a very young girl, Chow remained in China. As an adult, she married, had three children, joined the National People's Party (KMT) and received a degree in education from Zhong Shan University. During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Chow's mother attempted to rescue her from China; for this, Chow suffered years of public humiliation and three years of hard labor. After her mother successfully sponsored her visa application in 1980, Chow brought her family to America. At the time of the 1993 interview, Chow was an active retiree in a senior hospital apartment in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>

            <p>Born in 1948, Tony Giordano spent his pre-adolescent years in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn. He grew up surrounded by a family of Italian heritage with three siblings as well as Italian American and Irish American friends and neighbors. In 1961, the family moved to Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a neighborhood with a strong Puerto Rican heritage and an influx of Irish and Italian Americans. Giordano attended Brooklyn Technical High School and Staten Island Community College. After a brief foray into engineering work with the New York City Transit Authority, he became a teacher. His civic-minded upbringing led to a role as a neighborhood leader in Sunset Park.</p>

            <p>By outlining the experiences of the two prior generations, Tony Giordano explains in the interview how his family of Italian heritage came to be in Brooklyn. He focuses in on his father's occupations; ultimately one as a bus driver. Giordano describes his upbringing in terms of his family's apartment housing, Brooklyn neighborhoods, vacations on Long Island, education from first grade through college, and his Roman Catholic religious experience. The interview is in depth on his experience of losing faith in organized religion and later discovering a devotion to God. Contributing to this struggle with religion, Giordano talks about a failed first marriage, custody challenges over his son, a rekindled relationship, and a happy, interfaith marriage and family. He focuses on the ethnic heritage and late twentieth century makeup of the Sunset Park community and his role as a civic leader. The influx of large numbers of Chinese into Sunset Park in the late 1980s has created what Giordano calls the "Third Chinatown." Interview conducted by Gregory Ruf.</p>

            <p>Mak Shui Ka was born in Naahn Sehk Village, in China's Guangdong Province, to a wealthy, prominent family. She grew up with servants and attended the country's most prestigious schools. Her family's fortunes reversed during the opium suppression effort, which drove the family business into the ground, and the Communist "liberation," which repossessed her family's estate and brought persecution to her father. Ka relocated to America and eventually settled with her husband and three children in New York City. In Brooklyn, Ka took on odd jobs and experienced poverty for the first time. She persevered and joined the Seamstresses' Union, the Coalition of Women, and became a community organizer; championing the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn's Chinese community and pursuing anti-discrimination activity. At the time of the 1993 interview, Ka lived happily in Sunset Park with her husband; her three adult children lived nearby.</p>

            <p>Edmundo Quinones was born circa 1946 in Manhattan to Puerto Rican immigrant parents, and grew up in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn. As Latinos, the Quinones were discriminated against -- still, he remembers a childhood of mixed play in his working-class neighborhood with stick-ball and water balloons. At age fourteen Quinones moved to Puerto Rico. When he re-settled in New York City he found the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn to be inhabited primarily by Latinos. He married a Puerto Rican woman and had two sons. Around 1985, Quinones stumbled upon Brooklyn's Chinatown and was amazed to find the Chinese American community so quickly well-established.</p>

He reflects on the challenges he's faced as a Latino growing up in a White neighborhood; particularly discrimination, and strengthening his Latino identity while avoiding mainstream assimilation. He provides an overarching view on the American dream: class mobility (both upward and downward), ethnic relations, and neighborhood change. He describes the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bay Ridge's transformation from a predominantly poor Scandinavian enclave, to a Latino area called Sunset Park, to a bustling, predominantly Chinese American community.

            <p>Called by a relative to bring the word of Jesus Christ to Brooklyn's Chinese community, Reverend Fook "Samuel" Wong, at age forty-two, immigrated with his wife to New York City from Hong Kong in 1982. In 1983, they established the Chinese Promise Baptist Church in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. Through the church, Wong and his wife founded an annual Memorial Day Weekend street festival, which they hoped would increase neighborhood vitality and pride, while reducing street crime. At the time of the 1993 interview, Wong's daily activities were spent in community service; preaching, providing charity, organizing the annual street festival, and tending to the needs of his fifty parishioners.</p>

            <p>Married couple Guillermo and Norma Wong immigrated to Brooklyn, New York from Lima, Peru in 1980 to escape political, social, and economic unrest there. Because Guillermo Wong (who was half-Chinese) and Norma Wong both greatly appreciated Chinese culture, the Wong family felt at ease on their mixed Latino-Chinese street in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. At the time of the 1994 interview, the Wongs had been married twenty-four years, had three sons, and felt assimilated into American culture. They had recently begun a network marketing business which they hoped would offer financial freedom and the opportunity to buy a home.</p>

            <p>Yu Rong Zhu, born in 1927 in Taishan, China, lived through the Japanese Invasion of China, the Chinese Civil War, and the Cultural Revolution. Zhu's status as a civil engineer protected him from governmental persecution, and he was satisfied with life. But his children, who lost educational and professional opportunities to the Cultural Revolution, urged him to immigrate to America. With his wife, Zhu moved to San Francisco in 1988; his children soon followed. At the time of the interview, Zhu was sixty-six years old and lived in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn with his wife and eldest daughter.</p>
