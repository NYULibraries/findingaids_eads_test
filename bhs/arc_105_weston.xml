      <p>Martyn Weston (born Martyn Weinstein) was an architect active in Brooklyn and Queens from the 1920s through the 1960s. He and Samuel Malkind formed the firm Malkind &amp; Weinstein at 93 Court Street in downtown Brooklyn around 1927. Weston likely changed his surname during the World War II era. In the 1940s, his son Donald joined his office, which moved to 44 Court Street and became known as Martyn and Don Weston Architects. Weston primarily designed large residential and commercial buildings in Brooklyn and Queens. He was also an active member and president of the Brooklyn Society of Architects.</p>
