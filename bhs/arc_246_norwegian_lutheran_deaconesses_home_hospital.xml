      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Deaconesses' Home and Hospital, originally named the Norwegian Relief Society, was founded by Sister Elizabeth Fedde, a deaconess from Norway, and was incorporated in 1886.  Located at 441 Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, the Society was established to provide relief to Brooklyn and New York City's impoverished Norwegian population.  By 1889, the Society was able to open a 30-bed hospital at Fourth Avenue and 46th Street in Brooklyn, and in 1892 the Society was re-incorporated as the Norwegian Lutheran Deaconesses' Home and Hospital.  It later merged with the Lutheran Hospital of Manhattan in 1956 to form the Lutheran Medical Center.</p>
