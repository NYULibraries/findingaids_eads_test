      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The Council of Churches of the City of New York was founded in 1895 as the New York Federation of Churches and Christian Workers and renamed the Protestant Council of the City of New York in 1943. The Brooklyn Church and Mission Federation (originally formed as the Brooklyn City Tract Society in 1829) merged with the Protestant Council in 1946 to become the Brooklyn Division of the Protestant Council. The Brooklyn Division consolidated the various social services and mission work provided by churches, promoted interfaith church unity, and aimed to strengthen churches in the borough at a time when the Protestant population was shrinking. In 1968, The Protestant Council was renamed the Council of Churches of the City of New York. As of 2011, the Council of Churches still operates as an interdenominational organization and church council that advocates for issues affecting church members.</p>
