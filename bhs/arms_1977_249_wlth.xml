      <p>WLTH was an AM radio station established in Brooklyn in the 1920s.  In 1933 and 1934, WLTH collaborated with the Long Island Historical Society (later the Brooklyn Historical Society) to create a series titled "Looking Back in Brooklyn," which was broadcast on Sunday nights at 10:30 and provided dramatized versions of major events in Brooklyn's history.  WLTH merged with its time-sharing partners in 1941 and became WBYN.</p>
