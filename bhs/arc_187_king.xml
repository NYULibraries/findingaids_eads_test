      <p>The Horatio C. King collection spans the period circa 1850 to 1925 and relates to the activities of Horatio C. King; his second wife, Esther King; and Mary E. Hewitt, a writer and poet who was the mother of King's first wife, Emma Carter Stebbins.  Content also relates to the various organizations in which Horatio and Esther were involved, including the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Association of the United States; the Army of the Potomac after the Civil War; and the Fort Greene Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.</p>

Hewitt, including a valentine poem written for Hewitt by contemporary poet and good friend Francis Osgood.  Folder 2 contains a small assortment of newspaper clippings, mostly dating after 1900, relating to the establishment of the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park, the deaths of Horatio and Esther King, activities and inner politics of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and Horatio C. King's political involvement.  Folder 3 contains a dedication program for the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument, a program for the Society of the Army of the Potomac's 43rd annual reunion, and a memorial booklet for King.  Folder 4 contains King's published writings, including a song book for children, a sketch of the Army of the Potomac, personal reminiscences of Brooklyn, and poetry.  Folder 5 contains two recipe books, one of which also contains clippings of recipes and recipes written on scraps of paper.  Folders 6 and 7 hold two scrapbooks containing clippings covering Horatio C. King's myriad activities, including orations and lectures.  Folder 8 contains 1 framed and 11 loose photographic portraits of King family members and relatives.  Only a small number of the individuals depicted in the photographs are identified, including two of Horatio and Esther's daughters, Emma and Ethel; and Mrs. John T. Howard, Esther's mother.  While the remaining depicted individuals are not identified, most are presumed to be Horatio and Esther's other daughters.</p>

      <p>Horatio Collins King (1837-1918) was born in Portland, ME and graduated from Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA in 1858.  He practiced law for two years, and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1861. He served as a Civil War officer in the Armies of the Potomac and Shenandoah from 1862 to 1865.  He was honorably discharged in 1866 with the rank of brevet-colonel and returned to New York to practice law once more.  He was active in politics, running for Secretary of State for New York as a Democrat in 1895, Congress as a member of the Sound Money Party in 1896, and Comptroller for the Progressive Party in 1912.</p>
