      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>George Rogers Howell, M.A. (1833-1899) was born in Southampton, Long Island, N.Y., and graduated from Yale College in 1854.  He then taught at Princeton Theological Seminary, from which he graduated in 1864.  He worked as a minister in western New York until 1872, when he became the first librarian of the State Library of New York.  He later served as the archivist of the State Library.  Howell was also a prolific historian of New York State and published local histories of the early colony of New York, the capitol of Albany, the county of Schenectady, and the Long Island towns of Southampton, East Hampton, and Southold.  Many of his historical works included detailed family genealogies as well.</p>
