      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Scrapbook of artists' renderings of historical events and places in Brooklyn and New York City was compiled in 1941 and contains roughly 45 color and black-and-white images. The renderings are almost entirely comprised of clippings that document events and places in Brooklyn and New York City dating from circa 1700 to 1900, though there is one series of clippings of the work of American artist David Henderson that documents historical events throughout America. It is not known who compiled the scrapbook. Some of the pages of the scrapbook include handwritten ink notes and captions pertaining to the images. The pages of the scrapbook are brittle and have separated from the binding. Digital versions of some of the images from the scrapbook are available via the image database located in the library.</p>
