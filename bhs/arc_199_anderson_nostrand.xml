He was the son of Samuel Cowdrey Anderson (1849-1908) and the grandson of Peter and Maria Anderson. Peter Anderson was born in New York City and Maria Anderson (nee Nelson) was from Williamsburg. They married on December 20, 1847, moved to Brooklyn circa 1850, and lived on Boerum Street between Broadway and Bushwick Avenue in Williamsburg. Lewis Nostrand Anderson was also the grandson of Lewis Pease Nostrand (1823-1900; born George Lewis Pease Nostrand), a businessman and resident of the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. </p>
