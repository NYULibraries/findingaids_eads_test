    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Records of the New York Institute for the Humanities collection offers access for researchers interested in the history of intellectual life and the humanities in the period between 1974 and 2005. While the Institute's mission focused on intellectual activity in New York City, it also brought noted intellectuals to New York from Latin America and Europe, including those supported by the Exiled Writers program. </p><p>In addition to materials relating to the operation and activities of the Institute, the collection contains a large number of documents generated by Professor Richard Sennett, founder and former Director of the Institute. </p><p>Series I consists of records generated by the Director's Office and its staff. These records are related to both the administration of the Institute as well as non-Institute matters associated with the professional career of the Director. Richard Sennett generated the majority of the documents in this series; many of these relate to his career as an academic and a writer outside of his capacity as Director, such as correspondence with publishers and conference organizers.</p><p>Series II consists of seminars, Lectures and Events consists of records generated in the course of organizing and administering internal and public events; these materials include correspondence, reading lists, seminar minutes, posters, and transcripts of talks. Institute seminar leaders and members created many of the documents in this series. Materials for each seminar can range from one page of information, such as a list of attendees, to multiple folders of documents, sometimes including summary notes from each session and reading packets. Materials relating to Institute events, such as public lectures, include correspondence, transcripts of lectures and discussions, guest lists, and advertising flyers.</p><p>Significant seminars include Thomas Bender and William Taylor's "Culture of Cities", Richard Sennett and Michel Foucault's "Sexuality and Solitude", and the seminar "Sexuality, Gender and Consumer Culture." The year-long Times Square Conferences which evolved into the book "Inventing Times Square" (1991) are also well-documented. A List of all seminars and lectures held at the Institute between its founding and 1987 can be found in the Institute's Ten Year Report (Series I.A: Box 3 Folder 13). </p><p>Series III consists of audiovisual recordings of events sponsored by the Institute ranging from 1974 - 2005. Some of the recordings were previously transcribed, and those transcriptions are contained in Series II.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>History of the New York Institute for the Humanities</head>
<p>In the summer of 1976, New York University Professor of Sociology Richard Sennett chaired a conference on the Humanities and Social Thought in Bellagio, Italy. Sennett and other participants developed the idea for a New York-based institute to foster intellectual discourse and cross-disciplinary communication while at the conference. In December 1976 New York University and Richard Sennett's Center for Humanistic Studies co-sponsored the conference "The Future of the Intellectual Community in New York", which was co-organized by Sennett, New York University President John Sawhill, and New York University Professor Ronald Florence (then Director of the New York Council for the Humanities). Based on the success of the conference, Richard Sennett and President Sawhill co-hosted a series of informal dinners for cultural, labor, and business leaders, writers, and artists. Participants discussed how to continue to redefine and strengthen intellectual life in New York City. The ideas that arose from the dinners provided the structure for the New York Institute for the Humanities. Correspondence about these dinners, and the first proposals for a New York Institute for the Humanities, can be found in the Administrative Papers of President John Crittenden Sawhill (RG 3.0.8), Box 44.</p><p>In 1977 the New York Institute for the Humanities was established as a permanent activity of New York University by an act of the university's Board of Trustees. An advisory board was formed to help with the Institute's early development, while Sennett, <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> editor Caroline Rand Herron, and New York University Humanities Professor Thomas Bender worked with administrative assistant Toni Greenberg on the Institute's day-to-day operations. Rand Herron acted as a publications and communications consultant, creating a series of Institute lunches and Public Forums. Bender also contributed considerable time and organized the Institute's first Gallatin Lectures. In 1978, the Institute received significant funding from the Exxon Education Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, enabling expansion of its Fellowship and Lecture activities. In 1980 the Institute was independently incorporated and formed its own Board of Trustees; however, all daily administrative activities were handled by New York University, with the Institute's Board serving primarily in an advisory role.</p><p>From the time of the Institute's inception, the Fellowship program was the core of the New York Institute for the Humanities, embodying its mission to support the work of individual scholars and intellectuals in an environment which encouraged interaction. About half of the early fellows were academics from New York-area universities, while the rest were artists, writers, journalists, and public officials. In the early years, fellows generally met once or twice a month for informal seminars. As the Institute grew, Sennett worked with Aryeh Neier and Thomas Bender to create a more defined program in which Fellows--elected to either one-year or five-year fellowships--formed interdisciplinary seminars around topics of interest and participated in weekly Fellows Lunches. Most Fellows were unpaid, although some received office space or clerical support. Fellows were responsible for the Institute's internal operations, which were overseen by the Director and three committees: an Executive Committee, a Program Committee, and a Fellowship Selection Committee. </p><p>The Program Committee was particularly active during the Institute's first five years. The Institute hosted public lecture series and conferences, most notably the James Lecture Series and the Gallatin Lecture Series. In a concerted move to counter American isolationist tendencies at the time, the James Lectures brought primarily European intellectuals to the Institute. The Gallatin Lecture Series was created shortly thereafter to provide a diverse public audience for American humanists. The period of 1979-1983 was especially active, bringing such literary and intellectual figures as Michel Foucault, Italo Calvino, Czeslow Milosz, Jorge Luis Borges and Roland Barthes to speak publicly and to participate in seminars. In 1981 the Institute launched a Humanities Exchange Program for writers exiled from Latin American and Eastern European regimes. Many of the Institute's early lectures were published by Columbia University Press in "Humanities in Review" (1982), edited by David Rieff.</p><p>The Institute is still in operation, currently comprising approximately 150 Fellows, and typically holds luncheon-lectures for Institute Fellows every Friday of the academic year. In addition the NYIH organizes a variety of seminars, conferences, discussions, readings and performances that are free and open to the public.</p><p>Only a partial list of Directors of the Institute has been confirmed:</p><p> 1977-78 - Richard Sennett<lb/>1978-79 - Richard Sennett and Thomas Bender<lb/>1979-80 - Loren Baritz<lb/>1980-81 - Aryeh Neier<lb/>1981-82 - Edmund White<lb/>1982-83 - Edmund White<lb/>1983-84 - Edmund White and Richard Sennett<lb/>1984-85 - Jerome Bruner<lb/>1986-87 - William R. Taylor and A. Richard Turner<lb/>1987-88 - A. Richard Turner<lb/> </p><p>As founder of the Institute, Richard Sennett's papers form a large part of this collection. Sennett, an interdisciplinary scholar, novelist, and social critic, is currently Professor of History and Sociology at New York University, and Professor of Sociology and Chair of the Cities Programme at the London School of Economics. Born in Chicago in 1943, Sennett was trained as a cellist at the Julliard School of Music, and later studied sociology at Harvard University. After brief appointments at Yale and Brandeis Universities, he came to New York University in 1972, where he has spent the majority of his career. Sennett has written over a dozen books on subjects ranging from urbanism to modern capitalism, including <emph render="underline">The Hidden Injuries of Class</emph> (1972), <emph render="underline">The Fall of Public Man</emph> (1976), and <emph render="underline">Authority</emph>, as well as the novel <emph render="underline">The Frog Who Dared to Croak</emph> (1982).</p><p> Sources: </p><p><list><item>Benn, Melissa "Inner City Scholar" The Guardian Saturday February 3, 2001</item><item>Rieff, David. <emph render="underline">Humanities in Review</emph> Cambridge: New York Institute for the Humanities, 1982</item><item>Administrative Papers of President John Crittenden Sawhill, 1974-1981, (RG 3.0.8) New York University Archives</item></list> </p>  </bioghist>

Institute seminar leaders and members created many of the documents in this series. Materials for each seminar can range from one page of information, such as a list of attendees, to multiple folders of documents, sometimes including summary notes from each session and reading packets. Materials relating to Institute events, such as public lectures, include correspondence, transcripts of lectures and discussions, guest lists, and advertising flyers.</p><p>Significant seminars include Thomas Bender and William Taylor's "Culture of Cities", Richard Sennett and Michel Foucault's "Sexuality and Solitude", and the seminar "Sexuality, Gender and Consumer Culture." The year-long Times Square Conferences which evolved into the book "Inventing Times Square" (1991) are also well-documented. A List of all seminars and lectures held at the Institute between its founding and 1987 can be found in the Institute's Ten Year Report (Series I.A: Box 3 Folder 13). </p></scopecontent><c

Princeton University professor Anthony Grafton hosts and leads the lectures. Grafton discusses Kircher in general terms, then focuses on how Kircher thought about history, tradition, and the past, particularly Kircher's thoughts on how the Egyptian tradition was recorded in hieroglyphs. Next, Paula Finland discusses Kircher as a global figure, focusing on his deep and intimate connections around the world maintained through correspondence. After Finland, Michael John Gorman discusses Kircher the "engineer and magician", the creater of magnificent machines. Finally, David Wilson "channels" Kircher to close things out.</p></scopecontent><altformavail id="aspace_d2f90df0196e245ef91269234766c537"><head>Access copy</head><p>Access copy available on four CDs: ACCESS 7:24 - ACCESS 7:27.</p></altformavail><relatedmaterial id="aspace_949ab9f129179a1e8fb76e04c335c035"><head>Related materials</head><p>Tony Grafton discussed the symposium on an episode of "All Things Considered" on NPR.

Weschler explains the title by pointing out a common thread in the seemingly very different authors' works. Kapuscinski's The Emporer, on the surface was about an an anti-communist, Ethiopian regime being toppled, but was allegorical to the situation in Poland in the late 1970s. Oliver Sacks' Awakenings was about his patients with "locked in" syndrome, but could be compared to the result of liberation of nations, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, previously trapped under strict authoritarian rule.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Communism.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Psychology.</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Poland</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Psychology and philosophy</subject><subject source="local">Psychology |x Cases, clinical reports, statistics.</subject><persname role="spk" source="naf">Sacks, Oliver, 1933-2015</persname><persname role="spk" source="naf">Kapuściński, Ryszard , 1932-2007</persname><persname role="spk" source="naf">Weschler, Lawrence</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref2256" level="file"><did><unittitle>Discussing The New York Times design challenge for the World Trade Center site; a lecture by Herbert Muschamp </unittitle><unitid>cuid4114</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 sound cassettes</extent><extent altrender="carrier">56 minutes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2002/2002" type="inclusive">27-Sept-2002</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_2b8dbb7520b68d26183bdd615cc5b4f8" label="Mixed Materials [31142062736684]" type="Box">72</container><container parent="aspace_2b8dbb7520b68d26183bdd615cc5b4f8" type="Folder">8</container><container altrender="Card box, large" id="aspace_b220172f2df518eba2d8c547617ecbc1" label="Audio [31142062902252]" type="Box">Shared University Archives 110</container><container parent="aspace_b220172f2df518eba2d8c547617ecbc1" type="Item">30</container></did><altformavail id="aspace_29b00b5ad72efd27fd802dacb1f65dff"><head>Access copy</head><p>An access copy of this tape is available on CD: ACCESS 7:30.</p></altformavail><bioghist id="aspace_5a1cae60e8fbab9096c88030bc8c3ca0"><head>Historical Note</head><p>The content of this lecture is based on a design challenge put forth to architects in New York Times Magazine in June of 2002 to imagine the new use of space of the World Trade Center.

Intellectual goals stated in a letter of invitation were to better "understand how the productive processes of modern society are changing in ways not anticipated in past social theory" and to "expand the meaning of the term 'production' itself, so that it appears as a cultural, psychological, and epistemological category as well as a category in political economy." The final desired outcome of the conference was to set up an ongoing working group to pursue whatever develops during the sessions.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_91fa194cb4a602218fd4f0f0f938bd0e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Session 1: "The Production of Meaning" lead by Anthony Giddens and Bernard Williams.
