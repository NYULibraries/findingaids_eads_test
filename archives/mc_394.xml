    <head>Biographical</head>
<p>Joseph Delafield (1790-1875) was a New York City resident, lawyer, and soldier who fought in the War of 1812. From 1817 to 1828, Delafield worked as part of a commission charged by the Threaty of Ghent to establish the Northwest border of the United States.  As a member of this commission, Delafield traveled throughout North America and began collecting minerals; his mineral collection was eventually considered one of the best private collections in the United States.</p><p>Delafield was active in scientific associations and served as president of the New York Lyceum of Natural History from 1827 to 1866. He was also involved in the founding of New York University; he served as an early member of the University Council and was a signatory to "Considerations upon the expediency and the means of establishing a university in the city of New York, addressed to the citizens," one of NYU's founding documents.</p>  </bioghist>
