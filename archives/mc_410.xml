    <abstract id="aspace_04ae7942dbb3f5730c4c6231e74835a2">Merideth Wright attended the University Heights campus at New York University from Fall 1967-Spring 1969, and was involved in the inaugural class of the Metropolitan Leadership Program, which was devoted to interdisciplinary education. The Merideth Wright Collection on University Heights (dated circa 1967-1969) consists of photographs (prints, negatives, and contact sheets) of NYU students at the University Heights campus, including students at demonstrations on campus in 1968, and students attending the 1967 March on the Pentagon against the Vietnam War. The photographs document specific actions of student activism and organizing at the University Heights campus, as well as the broader context of campus activism in the late 1960s.</abstract>
