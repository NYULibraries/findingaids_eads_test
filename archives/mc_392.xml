    <abstract id="aspace_8bffe0b0898837a1d4119b51e5a9acf7">The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences serves as New York Unviersity's mathematics research school. It grew from the Graduate School of Arts and Science's Department of Mathematics starting in 1935, when Richard Courant joined the faculty. The Institute was named the Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in 1946. In that year and in 1954, research projects led to the establishment of the Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics and the Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics, respectively. NYU's first computer was installed at the Courant Institute in 1952, and its Computer Science program rapidly developed to include research on programming languages, computer graphics, parallel architectures, and theory. In 1965, the Institute was renamed after Richard Courant and moved to the newly constructed Warren Weaver Hall, where a majority of its activities still take place. The Division of Computational Fluid Dynamics was created in 1978. This collection consists of collected clippings, ephemera, and published writings documenting the career of Richard Courant, as well as the history of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. The collection also includes one audio reel.</abstract>
