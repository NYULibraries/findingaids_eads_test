Schutte' paused his studies after being drafted into military service during World War II, where he served as a medic in the Pacific theater of the war. After he completed his service he re-enrolled at NYU under the G.I. Bill. Schutte' continued his graduate education alongside teaching positions in Long Island. He later worked for the Long Island Rail Road to develop a training school for engineers and operators. Schutte' returned to teaching after completing his PhD and held adjunct professor roles at Hofstra University and Alephi University. He also developed classroom materials for the PBS documentary series <emph render="italic">Connections</emph>, ran programs within the New York State Education Department, and examined international educational funding expenditures with the United Nations Development Programme. Until the COVID-19 pandemic, Schutte' volunteered with students in Suffolk County to assist their entry into the workforce. The Al Schutte' Papers (dated 1938-2023) consist of materials created and collected by Dr. Al Schutte' documenting his education, military service, and professional career as an educator and school administrator. Materials include correspondence, ephemera, handbooks, handwritten notes, photographic prints and slides, and publications.
