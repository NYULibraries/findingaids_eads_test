Included in these documented programs is the NYU lecture series and the Arthur K. Salomon lecture, which broadcast speeches by prominent individuals made on the NYU campus. Many of the educational programs and talk shows emphasized an urban theme in keeping with the University's emphasis on building a positive public image as an exciting urban campus. These subseries illustrate both the educational and public relations functions of radio and television at New York University and reflect program management activities as well as administrative functions of the office. Subseries D contains files from the NYU Office of Public Affairs, of which the Office of Radio of Television is part, from 1976-1982. They are subject files arranged in chronological order. The subseries consists of correspondence, memos, press releases, drawing and diagrams, maps and charts, plans and blueprints. It deals with the administrative and functional aspects of the NYU Office of Public Affairs. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Office of Radio and Television was created in 1952 to oversee the development of University-sponsored and -produced radio and television programs. In addition to producing educational programs, the Office of Radio and Television advised NYU faculty members on developing their prospective programs. The office also acted as a liaison between NYU and the media.</p><p>Between 1957 and 1980, the Office of Radio and Television underwent several changes of administrative jurisdiction. On April 22, 1957, the Board of Trustees amended the New York University By-Laws to create the Office of Vice President for University Relations. In 1957, the Office of Radio and Television was one of several functions placed under the jurisdiction of the Vice President for University Relations. The director of the Office of Radio and Television, Warren A. Kraetzer, became one of the vice president's assistants. Ralph Rourke served as assistant to the director of the Office of Radio and Television from 1957-1965. In 1960, Thomas J. Brophy succeeded Kraetzer as Director of Radio and Television. </p><p>The decade from 1965-1975 saw increased administrative influence over radio and television activities. In 1965, the administrative jurisdiction of the office along with other public relations functions was transferred to the office of the Vice President for University Development, and the post of Director of Public Relations was created. The Director supervised radio and television productions and reported to the Vice President of University Development. Although the News Bureau, which included radio and television functions, was under the supervision of the Director of Public Relations, it is unclear if the News Bureau manager, Paul T. Herte, had any control over the Office of Radio and Television.</p><p>As a result of these administrative changes, the position of Director of Radio and Television disappeared, and Thomas Brophy became the assistant manager for the Office of Radio and Television. Ralph Rourke's title changed to producer/writer.</p><p>In the 1970s, the educational and public relations functions of the Radio and Television Office were divided. Brophy became "Sunrise Semester" producer, and Rourke became assistant manager for the new Bureau of Radio and Television, promoting NYU to the media, and arranging radio and television appearances for faculty and administrators.</p><p>The Office of Radio and Television underwent a third transfer of administrative jurisdiction in 1975 when a new Senior Vice President for External Affairs was appointed. His responsibilities included supervising the director of public affairs, who oversaw all public relations activities, including radio and television. </p><p>From 1975-1980 it is uncertain whether public affairs activities were supervised by a vice president, director or both. In 1975, Michael Blumenfeld is referred to as both "Director of Public Affairs" and "Vice President of Public Affairs."</p>  </bioghist>

The show evidences the University's interest in television as an educational medium. The show was a joint effort with NBC, whose contract did not allow for the show to be rebroadcast and who destroyed the tapes; as such, these files provide some of the only access to the shows.

records of the Office of Radio and Television from 1956-1980. The materials are arranged chronologically within each file.  The bulk of the collection consists of correspondence, memos, scripts, prospectuses, cue sheets, handwritten notes, program outlines, news clippings and press releases. These records reflect program management activities rather than administrative functions or policy decisions. They are primarily concerned with program research, public relations, arranging hosts and guests, and recording productions. </p><p>This subseries illustrates both the educational and public relations functions of radio and television at New York University. Many educational programs and talk shows emphasized an urban theme in keeping with the University's concern for building a positive public image of itself as an exciting, urban campus. The increasing importance of the Office of Radio and Television as a public relations vehicle is evident in the records of "Wisdom Bank," a clearinghouse for promoting media appearances by NYU faculty and administrators and of "College Career Clinic."  </p><p>Although the collection does not fully document the Sunrise Semester program, several files contain materials pertaining to the program. The materials also document the management of the University Broadcast Lab, a series of programs developed and produced by NYU students. Students wrote, directed, and performed original works and adaptations of well-known plays. The records of University Broadcast Lab include production meeting notes, which show organizational methods and the students' relations with faculty advisors and administration. </p></scopecontent><c

and Contents </head><p>The bulk of these records consists of correspondence, primarily of Ralph Rourke, then the Assistant to the Director of Radio &amp; Television, show scripts, program formats, budgets news clippings and press releases. These records reflect program management activities. They are primarily concerned with program funding and research, guest lists, guest questions, public relations, program scheduling and production. This series illustrates both the educational and even more important the public relations aspects of the office. Shows such as "Soul of Reason" and "Black Depths" examined topical aspects of black life, culture, politics and history. Shows like "Stock Market Observer" and "Taxpayers Clinic" provided the general viewing public with financial and investment information as well as forthcoming income tax filing changes. </p><p>Minutes from meetings of the University Television Committee, committee member names, early proposals and funding tactics are included here. The materials also document the University Broadcast Lab series. This was a highly successful endeavor which aired on WNYC-TV Channel 31 on Sundays from 6:00 to 6:30 am. In this series NYU students directed produced and performed in various productions. Included here are script samples, directors' kits and make-up techniques. The materials also document the NYU weekly radio show "Sound of Science," which first aired on WRCA on February 19, 1958. An early production of the office of Radio and Television, the show sought to promote the recognition and encouragement of scientific talent.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref289" level="otherlevel"

office files from the NYU Press Office from 1976-1982. These are subject files arranged in chronological order, earliest year first, with documents in each folder arranged in the same fashion. The bulk of the collection consists of correspondence, memos, press releases, drawing and diagrams, maps and charts, plans and blueprints. This series deals with the administrative and functional aspects of the NYU Office Of Public Affairs. Items include day to day activities of the office such as moves, equipment and furniture requirements, telephone needs, fire and safety issues. This series also illustrates the importance of the Office Of Public Affairs in terms of input to the annual report, commencement exercises and university advertising campaigns. For example, the materials document the Chet Huntley Memorial Lecture Series. This annual program was a joint venture between NYU, NBC News and the advertising firm of Levin, Huntley and Schmidt. A committee headed by Dr. Sawhill and NBC news correspondent John Chancellor selected the speakers for the annual event. Other materials document the 1981 and 1982 NYU Commencement Exercises. Included here are the president's remarks to the graduating class, the trustees dinner ceremony, press releases on the event and the commencement exercises program itself.</p></scopecontent><c
