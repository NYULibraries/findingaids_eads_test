    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Robert Raymo (1925-2009), a scholar of medieval English literature, served the majority of his academic career at New York University. He arrived at the University in 1964 as a professor of English and was named professor emeritus in 2002. Raymo chaired NYU's English Department (1969-1972) and Dramatic Literature Department (1969-1974) and served as the founding director of NYU's Medieval and Renaissance Studies Program.  He also served as dean of NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science from 1974 to 1979.  </p><p>Born in Pelham Manor on January 23, 1925, Raymo earned a B.A. at Fordham University in 1945. He received a scholarship from the American Academy of Classical Studies in Rome and a grant in aid from Columbia University to continue his studies at the graduate level. He received an M.A. in English from Columbia University in 1947 and used his two consecutive Fulbright Awards (1949-1957) for research to earn a doctorate at Cambridge University in 1953 in medieval and modern languages. He began his academic career in 1953 when he was appointed an instructor of English at the University of California at Los Angeles. Two years later, UCLA appointed him assistant professor of English, a position he held until 1957, when he joined the faculty at Rutgers University. By 1960 Raymo attained a full professorship at Rutgers, leaving 4 years later (1964) to join the NYU English faculty at the Graduate School of Arts and Science.  In 1964 he also received the Lindback Foundation Award for Excellence and Distinguished Teaching and the Rutgers University Alumni Distinguished Teacher Award.  </p><p>Raymo's administrative career with NYU encompasses his responsibilities as Head of the All-University Department of English, a post that discontinued in 1972 as a result of sale of the University Heights Campus in the Bronx. In 1969 he was named Chairman of the Department of English at Washington Square College, a position he retained with the merger of NYU's entire undergraduate and graduate faculty at the Washington Square Campus in 1973.  He also served as a member of  NYU's University Senate from 1969-1972, representing the interests of Washington Square College. From 1971 to 1973, he sat on the Budget Committee and advised the Chancellor on University budgetary policy. For several months he also served as member of the Committee on the Financial Emergency where he reviewed and commented on the 1972 Report of the Task Force, offering independent suggestions to improve the University's financial situation.</p><p>As a linguist and manuscript editor, Raymo focused his academic pursuits on medieval English literature of the 14th and 15th centuries and on works of Chaucer. As a book collector, he held memberships at both the Grolier Club, where he curated an exhibit of his collection commemorating the 600th anniversary of Chaucer's death, and the Lotos Club. During the last years of his life, he worked on compiling a comprehensive bibliography of Chaucer editions from 1447 to the present, based largely on his private collection. Raymo died on July 16, 2009 of cancer at New York City's Calvary Hospital.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection includes a number of publications that Raymo authored, contributed to, or edited, as well as multiple bibliographical texts relating to "Manuscripts of Religious and Philosophical Instruction," his chapter in <emph render="italic">Manual of Writings in Middle English vol. 7</emph> (1986). His other publications include: two manuscript copies of his 1953 dissertation, <emph render="italic">The Mirror for Fools By Nigel de Longchamps. A Translation into English with an Introduction and Commentary</emph>; <emph render="italic">Speculum Stultorum</emph>, ed. John H. Mozley and Robert R. Raymo (Berkeley, 1960) – a critical edition of the Latin text; and <emph render="italic">A Mirror for Fools: The Book of Burnel the Ass</emph>, trans. John H. Mozley – English translation, (2 hardcover copies (Oxford, 1961) and 1 softcover (University of Notre Dame Press, 1963)).</p><p>Also included are annotated secondary material, notes, and photocopies of scholarly articles relating to Raymo's work on <emph render="italic">The Mirror for Fools/Speculum Stultorum</emph> (1953 – 1963), "Middle English Works of Religious and Philosophical Instruction" (1986), <emph render="italic">The Mirroure of the Worlde</emph> (2003), and "Sources and Analogues of the General Prologue," in  <emph render="italic">Sources and Analogues of the Canterbury Tales, Vol. 2</emph> (2005). For his authoritative chapter "Middle English Works of Religious and Philosophical Instruction" in <emph render="italic">A Manual of the Writings in Middle English, 1050-1100, Vol. 7</emph> (1986), Raymo compiled 1800 bibliographic entries gleaned from his research in approximately 250 western European and American libraries.  He recorded many of his bibliographic findings on the index cards and notebooks contained within this series.   </p><p>
Materials include correspondence, and notes and articles relating to the John Donne Colloquium Raymo conducted at the Grolier Club, award certificates and scholarship letters he received over the course of his career, various offprints signed by authors, a published schedule of the 38th International Congress on Medieval Studies listing two sessions honoring Professor Raymo, a pewter plate celebrating the 90th Anniversary of NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science, and annotated texts and books inscribed to Raymo. As a bibliophile and book collector, he specialized in the works of Chaucer and curated an exhibition of his collection at the Grolier Club (of which he was a longtime member) in 2000 to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Chaucer's death. This series reflects his affinity for book collecting, and includes a number of annotated texts and inscribed books and offprints Raymo acquired through his various associations in medieval scholarship circles, spanning the years 1928 – 2007.</p>  </scopecontent>

As a bibliophile and book collector, he specialized in the works of Chaucer and curated an exhibition of his collection at the Grolier Club (of which he was a longtime member) in 2000 to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Chaucer's death. This series reflects his affinity for book collecting, and includes a number of annotated texts and inscribed books and offprints Raymo acquired through his various associations in medieval scholarship circles, spanning the years 1928 – 2007. The dates presented in Series V. represent the books' copyright dates. Inscribed/signed books have the date of inscription on the folder title.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref117" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">An Introduction to
