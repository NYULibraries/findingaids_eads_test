    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The records of the Edwin Berry Burgum Academic Freedom Case contain administrative and faculty materials assembled between 1952 and 1961. The bulk of the material falls between the years 1952 and 1953, the period of Burgum's suspension and dismissal following his refusal to answer questions before the McCarran Committee of the United States Senate. The contents of the Burgum records consist primarily of administrative and council minutes; bound transcripts of the legal hearings between Burgum and New York University; internal administrative correspondence; correspondence with the American Association of University Professors; and exhibits of legal evidence presented at litigation by both Burgum and the administration under the direction of Thomas Clark Pollock, Dean of Washington Square College between 1947 and 1962. The exhibits contain a great deal of published material, such as books, newspapers, journals, court transcripts, articles and essays. They have been included with the other exhibit items within the Senate Faculty Committee series.</p><p>The Burgum records reflect the difficult debates and conflicts in American higher education during the Cold War period. Since the material is administrative in provenance, the collection's series offer insights not only into the scope and nature of the Burgum controversy, but also into the administration's strategies and actions.</p><p>While the suspension of Burgum by Chancellor Henry Townley Heald was rendered by executive fiat only hours after Burgum's appearance before the Senate subcommittee, neither the Chancellor nor the Vice Chancellor and Secretary, Harold Oliver Voorhis, played an active role in the subsequent hearing of charges against Burgum. The Chancellor's role was to formulate and state the administration's position. The Vice Chancellor acted as a public relations officer who helped to correspond with the University community, the American Association of University Professors and the public at large. Dean Thomas Clark Pollock of Washington Square College recommended the actual dismissal of Burgum and preferred the charges against him. Pollock played the most active role of any administrative official involved. To hear Dean Pollock's charges, the University Council assigned the case to the faculty members of the University Senate. A Senate Faculty Committee was formed consisting of one representative from each of the twelve divisions of the University. This committee had the obligation to render a decision on the Dean's charges, although it did not have the right of final judgment. That Executive Committee of the University Council held that right.</p><p>Central to the records, and of particular interest, is the Senate Faculty Committee series. Box 1 contains transcripts of the University's legal trial against Burgum, while boxes 3 and 4 contain trial exhibit material, including exhibits from Burgum's defense and Dean Pollock's prosecution. Also of interest is correspondence in the Office of the Chancellor series. It contains letters of support and protest from the general public, educators, students, alumni, and faculty, and a lengthy set of correspondence between New York University and the American Association of University Professors over AAUP's investigation and censure of the administration's action in the Burgum affair. A particularly valuable overview and critical analysis of the Burgum case can be found in the 1957 report of New York University's investigation committee on the Burgum and Bradley cases. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Edwin Berry Burgum (1894 - 1979) was born in Concord, New Hampshire. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree at Dartmouth College (1915), a Master's from Harvard (1917), and his Ph.D. at the University of Illinois (1924). In 1924 Burgum began his career as an Associate Professor of English at New York University. In March 1927 he married Mildred Rabinowich.</p><p>His accomplishments included the publication of many books and articles in the field of literary criticism such as <title render="italic">The Literary Career of Edward Bulwer Lord Lytton</title> (1926), <title render="italic">The New Criticism</title> (1930), <title render="italic">Ulysses and the Impasse of Individualism, </title> (1941) and <title render="italic">The Novel and the World's Dilemma</title>, (1947). From 1936 to 1938 Burgum was an active contributor and editor of the Marxist quarterly <title render="italic">Science and Society.</title> Burgum served as president of the College Teachers' Union of New York City.</p><p>During the McCarthy era Burgum was one of five collegiate faculty members subpoenaed by the McCarran sub-committee of the Senate, organized to investigate communism in American schools. At a hearing in October 1952 Burgum invoked the First and Fifth amendments in response to Senate questions concerning his political beliefs. Arguing that his refusal to answer was a matter of principle, he was subsequently suspended from his teaching post. In April 1953, following his request for a hearing before the NYU Faculty Committee hearing, he was dismissed.</p><p>Over the next several years, the Committee for the Reinstatement of Professor Burgum, made up of lawyers, teachers and unions, continued to advocate on his behalf. The publication, <title render="italic">Academic Freedom and New York University: the Case of Professor Edwin Berry Burgum</title>, resulted from their efforts. Despite NYU's refusal to reinstate Burgum, he continued to publish and pursue his former interests. However, the outcome of his trial took a tragic toll on his family and led to a new career as a lay analyst and psychotherapist. In July of 1979 Burgum died after a long illness.</p><p>The following are excerpts from Senate Council minutes and provide a chronology of events: </p><p><emph render="bold">Oct 27, 1952, p. 4 </emph></p><p>Associate Professor Edwin Berry Burgum has been suspended from University duty because of failure to answer questions concerning affiliation with the Communist Party put by a duly constituted committee of the U.S. Senate.

    <head>Provenance</head>
<p>The administrative records of the Edwin Berry Burgum academic freedom case were received by New York University Archives from the Office of the Secretary, Bobst Library, in June of 1984 upon recommendation by an ad hoc committee appointed by Chancellor L. Jay Oliva in September of that year. The records had been restricted and sealed prior to the committee's decision to make them available for research. </p><p>The Burgum records are closely related to the records of the Lyman R. Bradley academic freedom case (1924-1961); the two collections were formerly housed together and are similar in character and content. Oversized material has been removed from the collection and is noted in the separation sheet. There are no restrictions on the collection's use. An attached synopsis of the Burgum case taken from Senate Council minutes is provided to offer an overview of the events.</p>  </custodhist>

While some of the material consists of copies and duplicates of records from other series, such as Dean Pollock's statement before the Senate Faculty Committee, Senate Faculty Committee reports, and Burgum's correspondence with the administration among others, much of the material is unique. This includes statements and reports from Rutgers and Harvard Universities concerning academic freedom and tenure cases; correspondence between Dean Pollock and Allan Riggs, Pollock's legal counsel from New York University's School of Law; and a transcript of Burgum's testimony in 1941 before the Rapp-Coudert Committee, an investigation undertaken by the New York State Senate into the assumed existence of teachers of communist affiliation within New York City's municipal school system.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref131" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Transcript of Burgum's testimony before Rapp-Coudert Committee</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Apr 1941</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_d292b0042ae606ed9a439327934de28e" label="Mixed Materials [31142062996031]" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_d292b0042ae606ed9a439327934de28e" type="Folder">19</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref132" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Aurther Lovejoy re: Academic Freedom vs. Communism</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1949/1953" type="inclusive">1949-1953</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_cc00843f692c48be5110b76b1e42d734" label="Mixed Materials [31142062996031]" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_cc00843f692c48be5110b76b1e42d734" type="Folder">20</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref133" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Letter to Dr. M.
