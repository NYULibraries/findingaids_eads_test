    <head>Historical/Biographical Note:</head>
<p>John R. Lamarsh, an eminent nuclear physicist and a longtime member of the New York University faculty, was born in Hartford, Connecticut on March 12th, 1928 and died on July 26th, 1981. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in General Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1948 and attained his doctorate in Physics from this same institution in 1952.</p><p>Dr. Lamarsh's first academic appointment was as Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Kentucky from 1953 to 1954. Following a brief appointment at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, he joined the faculty of New York University and served as Assistant Professor of Physics for one academic year. In 1957 he accepted the position of Assistant Professor of Engineering Physics at Cornell University, where he remained until 1962. Upon concluding his term at Cornell, Dr. Lamarsh returned to New York University's College of Engineering as Associate Professor of Nuclear Engineering and was also appointed Director of the Nuclear Engineering Program.</p><p>New York University's College of Engineering had offered courses in Nuclear Engineering since 1950. During the 1962-63 academic year the Nuclear Engineering Program was reorganized and the position of Director of the Nuclear Engineering Program was created. Under Dr. Lamarsh's direction the curriculum in Nuclear Science and Engineering was reorganized and expanded. During this same academic year the College of Engineering was renamed the School of Engineering and Science, taking effect in the 1963-1964 academic year. In 1967 the University's Board of Trustees approved a proposal to elevate the Nuclear Engineering Program to full departmental status, effective on September 1st, 1967.Professor Lamarsh, who was instrumental in organizing the department, was appointed its first chairman.</p><p>Dr. Lamarsh held the title of Associate Professor of Nuclear Engineering until 1966, when he was promoted to the status of full Professor of Nuclear Engineering; he held both these positions until 1973, when the New York University School of Engineering and Science merged with the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute to become the Polytechnic Institute of New York. Dr. Lamarsh served as Professor of Nuclear Engineering and headed the Department of Nuclear Engineering from 1973 until his death in 1981. While at the Polytechnic Institute, he maintained his ties with New York University by serving as Adjunct Professor of Environmental Medicine at the New York University Medical Center from 1973 until 1981.</p><p>During his tenure at New York University Dr. Lamarsh published Introduction to Nuclear Reactor Theory (1966). This graduate-level textbook was based upon lectures which he gave at Cornell and New York Universities on the topic of nuclear reactor theory. While at the New York Polytechnic Institute, he published his second major work, which was entitled Introduction to Nuclear Engineering (1975). This publication was based upon classroom notes prepared for courses he taught at New York University as well as at the Polytechnic Institute of New York. In addition to these two substantial publications Dr. Lamarsh published several reports, essays and articles during his illustrious career as an educator and renown nuclear physicist.</p><p>Aside from his academic duties, Dr. Lamarsh maintained several other professional positions with various federal, state and private organizations. Among these affiliations was the Brookhaven National Laboratory, where he served as Associate Physicist from 1954 to 1956. His consulting activities were numerous; among the agencies he served were: United Aircraft Corporation (1952-1953); Atomic Power Development Associates, Detroit, Michigan (1959-1960); The Gmelin Institute, Larchmont, New York (1957-1960); Picatinny Arsenal, Dover, New Jersey(1966-1972); Township of Lower Alloways Creek, New Jersey (1973-1978); International Nuclear Service Research, Inc. (1976-1978);the Federal Office of Technology Assessment (19761979); the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress(1976-1981); the United States General Accounting Office(1977-1981); the National Science Foundation (1979-1981); and the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company (1980-1981).</p><p>Furthermore, Dr. Lamarsh served on the Mayor's Technical Advisory Committee on Radiation for the City of New York(1974-1981), the Advisory Committee on Engineering Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (1977-1981) and the Visiting Committee in Nuclear Science, Maritime College, State University of New York (1979). Dr. Lamarsh's affiliation with professional agencies and societies in an administrative capacity was also extensive. He served as president of International Nuclear Service Research, Inc. from 1979 to 1981. He was elected chairman of the Education Committee of the American Nuclear Society's New York Metropolitan Section in 1966 and held this title until 1981. From 1975 to 1981 he served on the Executive Committee of the American Nuclear Society's Education Division. Dr. Lamarsh served as chairman of the American Nuclear Society's New York Metropolitan Section from 1977 to 1978 and chairman of the Society's Education Division from 1978 to 1979. Moreover, he was appointed administrative judge of the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, just prior to his untimely death in 1981.</p><p>Dr. Lamarsh's research, which dealt primarily with nuclear power development, was considerable. He undertook and produced extensive studies in the following areas: floating nuclear power plants in Korea, breeder reactor technology, nuclear non-proliferation policy, implementation and impact of the Nuclear NonProliferation Act, nuclear proliferation and the implications of educating foreign nationals, alternative fuel cycles and the Three Mile Island accident.</p><p>Dr. Lamarsh's firm belief in the advantages of nuclear power was clearly reflected inhis published research as well as in the speeches he addressed to varied audiences. His primary concern was to ensure the rational realization of nuclear power. He was very concerned with keeping issues of reactor safety and the control of nuclear weapons proliferation up-to-date. Moreover, Dr. Lamarsh made a concerted effort to clarify the relevance of nuclear technology in an attempt to benefit policy making decisions.</p>  </bioghist>

subjects: acid rain, cancer, civildefense, coal, cosmic rays, earthquakes, electric automobiles, energy and legislation, fires, fusionpower, hydrogen, magnetism, nuclear generating stations, nuclear NonProliferation policy,nuclear power, the Oklo phenomenon, ozone, radiation monitors, solar energy, thermo nuclearphenomena, transportation of nuclear fuels, transport theory, turbines, wind power and xrays. Insome cases these folders contain a considerable proportion of materials that document thesubjects, but in others the documents are scanty, often containing only a few pieces of printedmaterial. The folders on Thermo Nuclear Phenomena and Transport Theory contain lecture notesand other material that Dr. Lamarsh apparently used for teaching purposes. The contents of someof the other files suggest that perhaps Dr. Lamarsh utilized these documents in his variousresearch projects.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref316" level="otherlevel"

as an educator. In addition to lecture notes used by Professor Lamarshduring his early teaching career, this series contains material which relates to his involvement inrevising and updating various academic programs at New York University. His keen interest inacquiring an Aerojet-General Nucleonics (AGN-201M) critical nuclear reactor in order toenhance the educational opportunities offered by the Engineering School at New York Universityis also illustrated. Other material in this series reveals Dr. Lamarsh's interest in establishing aNuclear Activation Center at New York University. Moreover, Dr. Lamarsh's concern for therelationship between energy technology and public policy is apparent in his promotion of aCenter for Energy Technology and Public Policy, at New York University as well as at thePolytechnic Institute of New York.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref427" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>General: Lecture Material I</unittitle><unitdate

Proposed Publications. The subseries "Books"documents Dr. Lamarsh's two major publications: Introduction to Nuclear Reactor Theory(1966)and Introduction to Nuclear Engineering (1975). Aside from such technical matters asobtaining permission to use another's work, this subseries consists of correspondence with thepublishing company, some preliminary research material, comments on the two books andmaterial concerning second editions and translations. The subseries "Other Publications" includescopies of various editorials and articles penned by Dr. Lamarsh at various points during hisillustrious career. "Proposed Publications" consists of material, such as handwritten manuscriptsor typescripts that suggests Dr. Lamarsh's interest in publishing certain works which, for onereason or another, were not realized during his lifetime. The four works are: "The Elements ofNuclear Reactor Theory," "Nuclear Engineering Tables," "People, Power and Pollution: AnIntroduction to the Environmental Aspects of Electric Power Production," and "Radiation: OurUnseen Environment." "People, Power and Pollution" was apparently based on a non creditcourse which Dr. Lamarsh gave at New York University during the 1971-72 academic year.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref640"

SUMMARY The Lamarsh Papers contain a great deal of valuableinformation for the researcher. The series Consulting Services provides a wealth of informationabout Dr. Lamarsh's work as a consultant to various agencies and reflects his nuclear energypolicies. It includes studies and reports on research projects which he undertook for governmentand private agencies. The material documenting Dr. Lamarsh's work on advisory committees alsoreflects his attitudes towards several nuclear energy issues. Although the series Research Interestsis not particularly rich, it may suggest the wide variety of subjects in which Lamarsh took aninterest and it may also provide information as to how his research interests evolved during hiscareer. Regardless of his long tenure at New York University and the Polytechnic Institute ofNew York, the material in the series Academic Affiliations is not very extensive. It may,however, give the researcher a perspective of Dr. Lamarsh's involvement as an educator, as theseries on Professional Associations may provide a perspective of his activities in variousprofessional societies. The series on Publications and Speeches may suggest Dr. Lamarsh's senseof obligation to educate people about nuclear energy as well his concern with contemporaryattitudes towards nuclear issues. The Lamarsh Papers offer a rich resource for those interested inthe history of nuclear physics, in general, and in the career and point of view of a worldrenowned physicist in particular.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref901" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Photographs</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1955/1968" type="inclusive">1955-1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_5c738c3d4b2da3d52b8e18e84926b3f1" label="Mixed Materials [31142042258890]" type="Box">30</container><container parent="aspace_5c738c3d4b2da3d52b8e18e84926b3f1" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref904" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>News Items I</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1943/1981" type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_13dc207e5ae513c831348df7661a57b5" label="Mixed Materials [31142042258890]" type="Box">30</container><container parent="aspace_13dc207e5ae513c831348df7661a57b5" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref907" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>News Items II</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1959/1981" type="inclusive">1959-1981</unitdate><container id="aspace_f760858824d572728b5061b4ad277834" label="Mixed Materials [31142042258890]" type="Box">30</container><container parent="aspace_f760858824d572728b5061b4ad277834" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref910" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Tapes of BreederTechnology Seminar</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1981/1981" type="inclusive">1981</unitdate><container id="aspace_9f364c0464865007511c9aa797fb9dad" label="Mixed Materials [31142042258890]" type="Box">30</container><container parent="aspace_9f364c0464865007511c9aa797fb9dad" type="Folder">4</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref915" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series X: Photographs, Clippings, and Recordings Appendix I</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref916" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Speeches: Sarah Lawrence College;
