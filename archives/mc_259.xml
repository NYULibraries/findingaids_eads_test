    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Robert Landy Papers document Landy's work in theatre and education between 1967 and 2016.  The collection includes paper, born-digital, and audiovisual material documenting his professional and artistic activities in theatre, his work as a professor of drama therapy, and his scholarly writing on drama therapy.  Material in the collection includes draft and published scripts, articles, and books written by Landy and others; audio recordings of plays and theatrical events directed by Landy; material related to classes taught by Landy at NYU; and material related to trainings in drama therapy led by Landy in the United States (US), Europe, and Asia.  The bulk of the collection documents, "Drama in Education", Landy's class taught through NYU's television program <emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph> (1979-1981); his files on classes taught through NYU's Drama Therapy program in the 2000s; and his book <emph render="italic">God Lives in Glass</emph> (2001), which he later adapted for the stage.  The <emph render="italic">God Lives in Glass</emph> paper material includes original artwork by children, forms used during interviews with the children, drafts of the book and play.  There are also audio recordings of the play <emph render="italic">God Lives in Glass</emph> and scanned copies of notes and forms used by Landy in the course of his research for the book.

The scripts include original compositions by Landy and plays adapted by Landy from works by Horatio Alger and William Shakespeare.

This also includes video and audio recordings of "Drama in Education", a class taught by Landy during the academic year of 1979-1980 for NYU's television program <emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph>, as well as paper course outlines, notes, and study guides for the classes.

This material dates from the mid 1990s through the mid 2010s, and includes correspondence regarding planning of events, printed publicity materials, video recordings of trainings, and documentation on methods taught at the trainings.</p><p>Other material in the collection includes correspondence with colleagues, some files include publications by correspondents and notes by Landy; clippings and publications with articles by and about Landy; and issues of <emph render="italic">Arts in Psychotherapy</emph>, a scholarly journal edited by Landy in the 1990s.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Appraisal</head>
<p>In December 2020 the following were identified as candidates for deaccessioning and were removed from the collection: off-air recording of PBS' Independent Lens, a video introduction for a Chilean drama school, duplicates of Sunrise Semester recordings from Landy's class (not off-air recordings, the original footage), raw footage of healing ceremony in Korea, and video outtakes of play practice and scenes around a theatre.  These were removed from the collection because they were materials to which the University Archives could not provide access to, of little or no research value, not related to the collection, or were duplicative material.</p>  </appraisal>
