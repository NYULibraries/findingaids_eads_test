<p>All series except Series IV (Records of The Society of Cinematologists)and Series VIII are arranged alphabetically. Series IV is arranged chronologically. When there was an original folder title, it is shown in quotes; otherwise, a title has been assigned to the folder based on its contents.</p><p>Original order has been maintained within each folder. The collection arrived at the NYU Archives in folders labeled with an alphanumeric code (A1, A2) on a label that obscured handwritten folder titles. There were no discernible series, and the creator's original order was not evident at the folder level; however, there was evidence that within each folder the original order had been maintained. The alphanumeric code has been written on the folders.</p><p>To gain control over the collection, it was grouped into 8 series:</p>    <list numeration="upperroman" type="ordered">

<p><emph render="bold">Robert Gessner</emph></p><p>Robert Gessner was a pioneer in film education, a film professor at NYU, and a published poet, novelist, and screenwriter.</p><p>Gessner was born October 23, 1907, in Escanaba, Michigan. He received a B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1929 and an M.A. from Columbia University in 1930. Gessner started teaching at NYU in 1930, replacing Thomas Wolfe as an English professor. In the early 1930s he was a screenwriter in Hollywood, and his book "Massacre" was made into a film by Warner Brothers in 1934. Gessner began teaching cinema studies in 1935 in NYU's Division of General Education, and in 1939 he taught the first cinema course for credit in a liberal arts college, "Cinema as a Literary Art," at Washington Square College. Gessner founded the Motion Picture Department at NYU in 1941, the first four-year film curriculum leading to a B.A. degree in motion picture studies in the United States.</p><p>Gessner's articles on cinema were published in <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph>, <emph render="italic">Variety</emph>, <emph render="italic">Theater Arts</emph>, and other publications. His published books include: <emph render="italic">Massacre; A Survey of Today's American Indian</emph> (1931), <emph render="italic">Broken Arrow</emph> (1933), <emph render="italic">Upsurge</emph> (1933), <emph render="italic">Some of My Best Friends are Jews</emph> (1936), <emph render="italic">Here is my Home</emph> (1941), <emph render="italic">Treason</emph> (1944), <emph render="italic">Youth is the Time</emph> (1945) and <emph render="italic">The Moving Image, A Guide to Cinematic Literacy</emph> (1968). He won The New Republic International poetry contest in 1934.  In 1959 he became the founding president of The Society of Cinematologists (now called the Society for Cinema and Media Studies) a professional organization of film educators, filmmakers, historians, critics, and scholars. He was the first visiting professor to lecture in Israel (at Hebrew University), and he also lectured at film centers around the world, including universities in Rome, Vienna, Poland, Paris, Yugoslavia, and England. He received two Ford Foundation grants: one to produce a series of experimental films at Harvard university in 1962-63, and one to lecture at film academies in Eastern Europe in 1962. In 1964 he was Chairman of the Jury at the International Film Festival in Cork, Ireland, and appeared on the CBS television program Camera Three. In 1966 he was a fellow at Kings College, Cambridge University. He finished his book The Moving Image, A Guide to Cinematic Literacy before he died in June 1968. </p><p><emph render="bold">George Amberg</emph></p><p>George Amberg received his Ph.D. from the University of Cologne in 1930.

<p>The Robert Gessner Papers were donated to NYU by Doris Gessner in 1969. George Amberg oversaw the donation of the Gessner papers to NYU, and his papers were eventually intermixed with Gessner's. The George Amberg and Robert Gessner papers were transferred to the NYU Archives from the George Amberg Memorial Film Study Center (Tisch School of the Arts) in 2006.  Robert Gessner's scrapbooks, comprising Series VIII of the collection, were transferred from the Fales Library and Special Collections at NYU in 2010. A third scrapbook (compiled by Gessner on instruction at NYU) was found in the New York University Archives clipping collection and integrated into this collection in April 2019.</p>  </custodhist>
