    <abstract id="aspace_fe2a52e337b71fd8c7f8ddc140fa15d9">Bruce Chandler is an alum of New York University, and a retired professor of Mathematics at the College of Staten Island. The Bruce Chandler Collection of NYU Protest Posters (dated 1970, undated) consists of student-made posters and large flyers collected by Bruce Chandler. The materials document student activism on NYU concerning issues of civil rights, student rights, foreign policy, and university governance during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Topics prominently featured in this collection include the peace movement, opposition to the United States involvement in the Vietnam War, the shooting of college students at Kent State University by the Ohio National Guard, the presence of military and law enforcement officers on campus, and the Black Panther Party, particularly the trial of Bobby Seale. Many items document demonstrations and the occupation of university buildings by students in solidarity with a national student strike in 1970 following the Kent State shootings. The materials document specific actions of student activism and organizing at NYU, as well as the broader contexts of campus activism and the solidarity built amongst students across institutions.</abstract>
