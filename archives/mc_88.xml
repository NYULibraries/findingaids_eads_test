    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The John G. Mason Papers are a personal collection of records that document NYU student activity and the student movement. The collection is the result of selective recordkeeping on the part of the collection's creator and donor. Mason was an active or ex-officio member of many of NYU's student organizations during the late 1960s. As a result, several students and faculty members entrusted him with their materials regarding this period. The collection covers the period 1962-1978, although the bulk of the materials are concentrated upon the period from 1965 through 1971. It is also important to note that while there are some materials from the University Heights campus in the collection, the bulk of the material is from the Washington Square campus.</p><p>The primary collection materials include: leaflets, organizational position papers, flyers, posters, handbills, public-relations pamphlets, university and student publications, newsletters, newspapers, analytical, financial, and strategic documents, and multiple analyses of the university's structure, officers, trustees, financial activity, professoriate, and curriculum. The collection also includes ephemera such as buttons and organizational membership cards. Included as well is 16mm film footage of a student and faculty protest against Dow Chemical Corporation recruiters on campus. This footage was filmed by NYU Campus Security. These materials exist as manuscript, typescript, mimeographic reproduction, printed matter and freehand drawings.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>A member of the interdepartmental Albert Schweitzer Program in the Humanities for undergraduates at New York University, John G. Mason was active in the Students for a Democratic Society and other university student organizations of the 1960s-1970s. Like many other students of the period, Mason was involved in organizations which were funded and/or organized by the university, and also in organizations which were external to the university and self-funded.</p><p>Mason was strongly affected by his matriculation in the Schweitzer Program, which was established by New York State in 1965 and given an endowed chair. The Schweitzer Program was led by Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien from 1965-1969. Dr. O'Brien, a Left-opposition politician in the Republic of Ireland (Eire), and a longtime contributing editor to the <emph render="italic">Atlantic Monthly</emph>, had a significant intellectual influence upon Mason and other members of his student leadership cohort (see the general history of NYU contained within the collection).</p><p>In his collected correspondence Mason also attributed a portion of his political views to his experiences in Paris, France, which he visited in 1968 in the aftermath of the "Paris Commune" and the national students' strike, which strongly affected French educational policy through the mid-1970's.</p><p>After his involvement with NYU and the student movement as an undergraduate, Mason went on to get a M.A. from NYU's Politics Department and then a Ph.D. from CUNY.</p>  </bioghist>

Students active in the Anti-War Movement also played a significant role in the organization. NUC-NYU's activities fully reflected the national organization's concerns with providing leftist education alternatives for undergraduate and graduate students. Some of the NUC-NYU projects documented in this series are: the publication of NYU Inc., a financial and social analysis of NYU's Trustees Council, endowment investments, Law School, and financial ties to war contractors and the South African government; the early research for and support of the "University Without Walls" program at Washington Square, and involvement in the creation of the Metropolitan Studies Program; and finally, the Ivan Bennett Affair, to name only a few of the more prominent examples of NUC's activities.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref50" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>NUC: National &amp; Regional Materials I</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1968-1971</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_0246acf1d0dd45c9cbe19aea0c947de6" label="Mixed Materials [31142062999084]" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_0246acf1d0dd45c9cbe19aea0c947de6" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref51" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>NUC: National &amp; Regional Materials I</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1968-1971</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_87de64ffe30c746f710866f98ea938bb" label="Mixed Materials [31142062999084]" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_87de64ffe30c746f710866f98ea938bb" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref52" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>NUC: National &amp; Regional Materials II</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1971</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_cc65ecf17d3c16d1590a8b25e5926a26" label="Mixed Materials [31142062999084]" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_cc65ecf17d3c16d1590a8b25e5926a26" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref53" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>NUC: N.Y.U Chapter (NUC-NYU)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1968-1974</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_61e4c697a1a044a3132fa6516892379b" label="Mixed Materials [31142062999084]" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_61e4c697a1a044a3132fa6516892379b" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref54" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>NUC-NYU: Ivan Bennett Affair Papers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1970" type="inclusive">1970</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_38ebfadba0bf4ec4d5b81a9957adba76" label="Mixed Materials [31142062999084]" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_38ebfadba0bf4ec4d5b81a9957adba76" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref55" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>NUC-NYU: Raw Data for NYU Inc.

For an analysis of these events which is based primarily upon the records of the Cafeteria and Library workers' union local, and upon oral histories, see Peter Miller's video "Violets on the Picket Line."
