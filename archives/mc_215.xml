    <abstract id="aspace_b32d0ee941fe8f40fa2d8b2a2cdeebd0" label="Abstract ">This collection documents the legacy of Edith Kramer, a woman artist, author, teacher, and practitioner who used art with disadvantaged children in a variety of settings before founding the graduate program in art therapy at New York University. After immigrating to the U.S. from Vienna in 1938, she taught art and practiced art therapy at several institutions before coming to NYU in the 1970s. The collection includes her personal and professional papers, publications, photographs, slides, and works of art.</abstract>

<p>This collection reflects Edith Kramer's work as an artist, art therapist, and teacher. The collection is comprised of research materials, correspondence, lectures, publications, and works of art created and collected by Kramer.

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection was processed by several University Archives staff members over a period of six years. An organizational structure for the collection was devised based on the first three accessions of material (received in 2010 and 2011). Additional accessions were added to the appropriate series as they were received. The biographical note was written by David Henley, long-time collaborator of Kramer's and executor of her estate.</p><p>Artworks contained within the collection are referred to by their formal titles when those titles are known. Many of the artworks contained within the collection--both works completed by Kramer and by her patients--are not titled. These works are referred to by date or distinguishing feature, some have descriptions of the work in brackets.</p><p>In August 2017, 14 items were prepared to be moved to offsite art storage in September 2017. In 2018 an accretion of materials donated by 2011 was incorporated into the collection as a new series.</p><p>In 2019, materials in Subseries V.B received conservation treatment. This treatment involved covering personal health information in ways that can be reversed after the collection is fully open. </p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Edith Kramer was born in 1916 in Vienna, Austria. At the age of 13, she began studying art under the tutelage of Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, an artist who worked within the Bauhaus movement. Dicker-Brandeis moved to Prague in 1934, and Kramer traveled there with her. While in Prague both women taught art to the children of families who had fled Nazi Germany. Kramer credited this formative experience with inspiring her interest in art therapy. Kramer grew up in a family with strong interests in Freudian psychoanalysis, and neo-Freudian concepts regarding attachment, aggression, and libidinal impulses later influenced her views on art therapy. </p><p>In 1938 Kramer fled Austria and arrived in New York City as a refugee. In 1938 she began teaching art and shop classes at the Little Red School House in Greenwich Village and she later went on to work in a machine shop during World War II.</p><p>In 1950 she was appointed art therapist at the Wiltwyck School for Boys in Eposus, New York. This appointment marked her first formal position as an art therapist. Her experiences at Wiltwyck inspired her seminal book, <emph render="italic">Art Therapy in a Children's Community</emph>, published in 1958. Over the next decades she made a name for herself as one of the pioneers of art therapy and worked to develop art therapy programs in a number of children's institutions including the Leak and Watts Children's Home, the Turtle Bay Music School, the Guild School of the Jewish Guild for the Blind, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Department of Child Psychiatry. These experiences informed her 1971 work, <emph render="italic">Art Therapy with Children</emph>.</p><p>In 1971 Kramer was part of the team that founded an art therapy program at George Washington University. She then came to New York University in 1973 to create a graduate program in art therapy at the School of Education, Health, Nursing, and the Arts Professions (now the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development). By 1976 the program had obtained approval from the New York State Department of Education, and in 1979 it was one of the first programs to receive approval from the American Art Therapy Association.</p><p>Kramer was also an artist during her time in academia; she worked part-time as a professor and continued as a working artist. Kramer worked as a painter, sculptor, printmaker, mosaicist, and collage-maker and her works include landscapes, industrial paintings, sketches, etchings, and a number of sculptures. A mosaic she created for the Metropolitan Transit Authority may be found in the Spring Street A/C/E subway stop.</p><p>Kramer retired from NYU in 2005. She continued to lecture and make art until her death in 2014 at the age of 97.</p>  </bioghist>

Some slides were labeled by the donor, and where it was possible, the original label was retained and put in quotation marks. The majority of slides are of Edith Kramer's adolescent patients' artwork, sometimes organized by patient, by institution, or by psychotherapy principle. A good portion of the slides are also of Edith Kramer's own work, ranging from late 1930s paintings to works completed as recently as 2001. The photographs mainly comprise pictures of Edith Kramer, pictures and prints of her artwork, and photographs of her young patients' artwork. Also included are examples of artworks created by other art therapists or their patients that were given to Kramer.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_ca43600cd20823b8103178ce425ed79b"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The photographs and slides are organized roughly by format. Slides are arranged in sleeves as they were received from the donor; when slides were rehoused, this arrangement was preserved.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_48576dcc96d8502efde9fb59437fe114"><head>Processing Information</head><p>The titles of some files in this series have been redacted to remove personal health information.

Her lecture was a feature of her own exhibition that was on display there at the time, and a celebration at the beginning of Women's History Month. The exhibition featured subway-related art Kramer had created between 1940 and 1994. She discusses her artwork and life in New York City. </p><p>The event is apparently sparsely attended as the Museum Curator Tom Harrington says in his opening remarks, "the world's situation has kept the crowd down to just a few." He does not specify what situation he means, but it is possible he is referring to the shooting attack on a bus full of Orthodox Jewish students that had taken place on the Brooklyn Bridge that morning, which would eventually result the death of 16-year-old Ari Halberstam. At the time of this recording, the shooter, Rashid Baz, was still at large.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Art.</subject><subject source="aat">subway trains</subject><subject source="lcsh">Subway stations.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Subways in art</subject><subject source="lcsh">Subways.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Artists.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Art -- Study and teaching.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Art therapy.</subject><corpname authfilenumber="(lccn)n2001104273" source="naf">New York Transit Museum</corpname><persname role="spk" source="naf">Kramer, Edith, 1916-</persname><corpname authfilenumber="(lccn)n80050217" source="naf">New York (State).

"Das Lied ist aus" is the original title of a 1930 German film. The title translated into English as The Song Is Ended. Elisabeth Neuman-Viertel was a German actress. While she was active at that time, she was not in the cast. Neuman-Viertel was active at the time of these recordings and was in a 1988 film entitled, Wie kommt das Salz ins Meer? The beginnings of both sides is identical, a female voice speaking in German fading out as the sound of goose-stepping soldiers fades in. Based on this identical content, the consecutive dates and the serial notation of "parts 3 and 4," these are probably recordings of two episodes of a radio show of some kind, possibly focusing on 1930's German cinema. Without the ability to translate, it is impossible to tell.</p></scopecontent><altformavail id="aspace_24302ba6b635ffe060ce8fa2599262cb"><head>Access copy</head><p>Access copy available on CD: ACCESS 10:31</p></altformavail><controlaccess><genreform source="aat">Film.</genreform><persname source="naf">Neumann-Viertel, Elisabeth, 1900-1994</persname><persname source="naf">Bolváry, Géza von, 1897-1961</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref295" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="doublequote">Gauz Ich Daheim be Edith Kramer</emph> </unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 sound cassettes</extent><extent altrender="carrier">Approx. 15 minutes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2003/2003" type="inclusive">11 July 2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="ger">German</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Card Box - 8 x 15.25" id="aspace_eadf7de5d52ed016a0d4d944f36f4773" label="Audio [31142062748911]" type="Box">9</container><container id="aspace_9d2cc463d8ed43b57dd547a84f0f0219" parent="aspace_eadf7de5d52ed016a0d4d944f36f4773" type="Cassette">16</container><container altrender="Card box, large" id="aspace_8e1861aada836e30d74e2eb682df1807" label="Audio [31142062902153]" type="Box">Shared University Archives 113</container><container id="aspace_530333c06f2070923cb812572e2c6be1" parent="aspace_8e1861aada836e30d74e2eb682df1807" type="Item">32</container></did><altformavail id="aspace_52f15346b487d75b23d70f9572cdfa2a"><head>Access copy</head><p>Access copy available on CD: ACCESS 10:32.</p></altformavail><scopecontent id="aspace_cd092cc70511c8ce01b02359d84914d6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Recording is in German.

This school was founded by the Episcopal City Mission Society in 1936 as a school and residential treatment facility for Black boys who were diverted from the juvenile justice system. In 1942 the Episcopal City Mission Society announced it could no longer financially support Wiltwyck and group of concerned citizens including Eleanor Roosevelt recognized the value of the school and banded together to fund the school and reorganize it under the State Department of Social Welfare. After the reorganization the school was non-secular and racially integrated, and in 1953 Wiltwyck began to accept students with emotional disabilities. </p><p>After leaving Wiltwyck, Kramer worked as an art therapist at the Leak and Watts Children's Home, the Turtle Bay Music School, the Guild School of the Jewish Guild for the Blind, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Department of Child Psychiatry.</p></bioghist><c id="aspace_16af4aa51e0521bc59f1fe53d91f435e" level="file"><did><unittitle>[angel and devil]</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1951/1957" type="inclusive">ca. 1951-1957</unitdate><container id="aspace_9634fd6d2fdbd920a3824c709157c670" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">99</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_5b8a60ad9ef8b009d443ea949e53b383"><head>Historical</head><p>This artwork was created at Wiltyck School for Boys between 1951 and 1957.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_e62369878d2079646b42e96ed897a9da"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>18 x 22 inches, matte opaque paint on paper, varnished.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_a7d527c87c5c19f4c7fddb2c01c75412"><head>Processing Information</head><p>This item received conservation treatment.
