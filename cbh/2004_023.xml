    <abstract id="aspace_59a48e263a012a0809b0e1394fa85535" label="Abstract">This collection contains seventeen scrapbooks and one incomplete index compiled by Arthur I. Okanst (1886-1965) of Brooklyn, New York (N.Y.).  These scrapbooks document the personal life and interests of a Jewish Brooklynite during the middle third of the twentieth century.  The scrapbooks consist mainly of newspaper clippings, programs, menus, newsletters and other printed ephemera that cover the topics of domestic and international news, Jewish-American life, celebrities, theater, radio, and sports.  The collection includes materials from various Jewish charities and organizations, and from Okanst's Temple.  The collection also contains many greeting cards, as well as bar mitzvah and marriage announcements.</abstract>

    <head>Scrapbooks Index Note</head>
<p>Okanst's Index</p><p>Terms
Arthur I. Okanst's incomplete hand-compiled index consists of nearly 600 entries.  Less than 200 are subject terms; the remaining two-thirds are personal or family names.  The index that appears below was copied from Okanst's manuscript index.  Duplicate terms have been consolidated, and the terms have been separated into two classes (subjects and names) and alphabetized.  Corrected or expanded terms appear in [brackets].</p><p>Location notation
Locations associated with each index term appear as a fraction.  The first number is Okanst's scrapbook number designation.  The second number refers to the foliation.  Each page has been numbered in the upper right corner of the recto.  The number refers to that leaf's recto and the previous leaf's verso.  </p><p>Because the first and last scrapbooks are not part of the collection, Okanst's locations match the scrapbook titles in the following manner (these numbers represent the first half of Okanst's fraction-like notations):</p><p>1	Not present

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The seventeen scrapbooks were once part of a larger series of nineteen.  The first and last scrapbooks were not donated to Brooklyn Historical Society.  The inclusive dates of the first scrapbook are unknown, but the final scrapbook covers May to September, 1965, and it is likely that it was largely uncompleted.  The presence of the two missing scrapbooks was ascertained by deciphering Okanst's hand-compiled index, also included in this collection.</p><p>The scrapbooks are common lined composition notebooks, hand foliated.  They contain clippings and published obituaries; theater and event programs and playbills; souvenirs, menus, leaflets and other printed ephemera; greeting cards (especially Birthday and Anniversary cards), telegrams, and invitations to weddings and bar mitzvahs.</p><p>The scrapbooks provide indications as to Okanst's life and interests.  He was an active member of his Temple, and followed politics and Jewish relations at a local, national, and international level.  He enjoyed entertainment, especially the theater, and was interested in radio, television, celebrities, and sports, especially boxing and baseball.  There is unfortunately no record of his professional life included in the scrapbooks.  </p><p>Most items are newspaper clippings and most items are pasted in.  Many items are dated, either by hand in a large script or, later, by stamp.  Some newspaper articles have portions underlined, though there are few, if any, annotations.  Items that Okanst indexed have been marked with a check.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Arthur I. Okanst was born on 22 March 1886, and married Helen Newman on 31 July 1910.  The family lived in Flatbush, Brooklyn (at 1625 East 13th Street, from at least 1940 through at least 1961), and raised a daughter, Harriet.  Harriet married Avery Grossfield, and they had two daughters: Anne Faith and Rena Ellen.  At some point, the Grossfield family moved to Texas.</p><p>Okanst actively followed news related to the world and national state of Jewish affairs.  In the scrapbooks, he kept many clippings on famous Jewish Americans, as well as news articles on anti-Semitism and the events leading up to and during World War II.  Okanst was an active member of his Jewish community – the scrapbooks contain programs, menus, and other materials from the United Jewish Appeal, the Young Men's Hebrew Association, American Palestine Campaign, the Federation of Jewish Charities in Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Zionist Region, and other Jewish charities.</p><p>Okanst attended the Reform Synagogue Temple Ahavath Sholom of Flatbush.  He was close to Rabbi Alexander Alan Steinbach there, and they exchanged intermittent correspondence beginning in the mid 1930s.  Okanst attended and kept the typescript lectures of Rabbi Steinbach's Adult Education Courses throughout the thirties and forties.  He also saved the monthly newsletters published by the Temple's Men's Club.  Although an active parishioner, Okanst does not seem to have held any offices or served on any committees at the Temple.</p><p>
The Okanst family likely took at least two vacations: it is probable that they visited Niagra Falls in the summer of 1936, where souvenir leaflets from the Old Fort Niagra and Shredded Wheat factory were obtained,  and Miami, Florida in the winter of 1948.  Additionally, Okanst seems to have enjoyed popular entertainment:  he attended at least one Worlds Fair (1939), from which he kept printed ephemera,  and frequently attended the theater.  He also followed celebrity news, as is evidenced by numerous clippings on the various marriages, divorces, and legal cases of the contemporary stars.  </p><p>Almost nothing is known about Okanst's professional life.  He attended the 10th annual lawyer's club dinner in 1943, and may have been in the legal profession.  He retired in 1955, and a cocktail party was given in his honor by friends and colleagues.  No records of employment or professional affiliation have been found in the scrapbooks to date.  </p><p>After at least two surgeries and a painful decline, Arthur Okanst died in September 1965.  Helen joined their daughter's family in Texas after his death, where she died on 13 September 1970. </p>  </bioghist>
