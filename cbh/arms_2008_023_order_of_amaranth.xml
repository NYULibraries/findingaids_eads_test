    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Order of the Amaranth, an international women's social and philanthropic society closely affiliated with the Freemasons, was officially organized on June 14, 1873 in New York City by Robert Macoy, Master Mason and first Supreme Royal Patron of the Order. The name and theme of the society is taken from the Court of Queen Christina of Sweden (1632-1654), though there is no direct connection between the two entities.  Originally part of the Order of the Eastern Star, a fraternal organization open to both men and women, the Order of the Amaranth became an independent organization in 1921.  Membership in the Order of the Amaranth was limited to Master Masons and their female familial relations.</p><p>Brooklyn Court No. 4 of the Order of the Amaranth, one of many courts in Brooklyn and New York at the turn of the 20th century, was established in 1897.  Regular meetings for Brooklyn Court No. 4 were held at the Johnston Building at 6 Nevins Street in Brooklyn.  The court held regular fund raisers to benefit both the Order of the Amaranth and selected charities.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
