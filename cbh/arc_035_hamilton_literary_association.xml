    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Hamilton Literary Association was a prominent debating society established for the purposes of "mutual improvement in writing, criticism, and forensic discussion."  Originally formed in 1830 as the Young Men's Literary Association of Brooklyn in a small building on Cranberry Street, it changed its name to The Hamilton Literary Association in 1831.  Among the Association's original founders were some of Brooklyn's most distinguished citizens, including Alden J. Spooner, Henry C. Murphy, A.A. Low, Judge J.M. Van Cott, Judge Greenwood, A.B. Baylis, and Samuel McLean.  The Association remained active as a separate entity until 1883, when it merged with the Hamilton Club, a men's social and literary club. The Hamilton Club had been formed only a year earlier in 1882 and was located at its clubhouse at the corner of Clinton and Remsen Streets in Brooklyn Heights, the entance of which was adorned with a bronze statue of Alexander Hamilton.  In 1931 the Hamilton Club became part of the Crescent Athletic Club, a prestigious Brooklyn country and sporting club.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
