<p>Emma Toedteberg (1857-1936) joined the staff of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) at the age of 13. Following the tenure of George Hannah, she served as the Society's third librarian from 1889 until her death. Toedteberg was an avid proponent of animal rights and a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Nativity in Brooklyn. She also inherited from her father a passion for collecting bookplates.</p><p>Augustus Toedteberg (1824-1909), her father, emigrated from Germany in 1844 and worked as an inlay illustrator in New York City. He married fellow German immigrant Catherine Lager (d. 1905) in New York City in 1849. In addition to Emma, the couple had another daughter, Louise Toedteberg (1853-1938). The family resided at 274 Vanderbilt Avenue in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, and later at 628 East Delmere Place (now known as East 23rd Street) in Flatbush.
Harriet Stryker-Rodda was the Long Island Historical Society librarian in the 1960s, and published books on genealogy research, Brooklyn church records and a guide to colonial handwriting.</p><p>Harriet Styker-Rodda was the Long Island Historical Society librarian in the 1960s, and published books on genealogical research, Brooklyn church records and guides to colonial handwritting. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Emma Toedteberg bookplate collection is comprised of an estimated 7,000 bookplates dating back to the early 18th century.  Originally created by Miss Toedteberg's father, Augustus Toedteberg, the collection was expanded in the 1960s by librarian Harriet Stryker-Rodda, wife of the Society's then vice president Kenn Stryker-Rodda.  Loosely alphabetized and organized by subject, the collection includes armorial, heraldic and presentation bookplates of individuals and institutions, and the works of numerous engravers such as Edwin Davis French, Charles W. Sherborn and John W. Evans.  Arranged with the bookplates is a series of previously compiled indexes, which provide a comprehensive point of entry into researching the collection, along with related papers and correspondence.</p><p>The collection represents the culture of American and British book collecting for both personal and institutional libraries, from the colonial era through World War I.  The abundant patterns of artistic styles, bookplate types and printing techniques reflect a unique modern history of the graphic arts.  As many of the bookplate owners are persons of artistic, financial and political consequence, the collection offers a distinct perspective on social and class history. </p><p>Included are the bookplates of prominent Brooklyn figures such as Bishop Cadman and Henry Ward Beecher; early New York figures colonial like Governor Cadwallader Colden, Mayor James Duane, and John Pintard, a founder of the New York Historical Society; and artistic personalities such as magician Harry Houdini, Hollywood performers Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, and Broadway impresario David Belasco.  Included are the bookplates of United States Presidents John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren and Theodore Roosevelt; Adam Smith, author of <emph render="italic">The Wealth of Nations</emph>; Captain James Cook, the eighteenth-century explorer, and Marie Antoinette.  Also featured are the institutional bookplates of the Brooklyn Historical Society; The New York Society Library, the oldest private library in New York City; The American Museum of Natural History; and the Brooklyn Club.</p>  </scopecontent>

Born in New England, French attended Brown University for one year before finding work as an engraver of silverware for the Whiting Company in Massachussetts.  In 1876, French relocated to New York City and studied at the Art Students' League, where he later served as President.  He was introduced to the art of bookplates by his sister-in-law, Helen Elvira Brainerd, who organized a collection of American and European ex-libris for the library of Columbia University.  In addition to the over 200 bookplates French engraved and designed for collectors and institutions, French designed plates for his personal collection of international language books, with an emphasis on Volapuk, a constructed language devised in 1879 by a German priest.  Among French's work are bookplates for St. Paul's Chapel, on Lower Broadway in Manhattan; Fraunces' Tavern, a Revolutionary War eatery and museum; and the New York Police Department's Central Booking, known as 'The Tombs."</p><p><emph render="bold">Sources:</emph></p><p><emph render="italic">The Autobiography of Edwin Davis French</emph> (1901)</p><p><emph render="italic">Edwin Davis French, A Memorial</emph> (1906) by Mary Brainerd French</p></bioghist></c><c id="aspace_ref34_zee" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 2: Charles W.

W. Spenceley of Boston, who has etched and engraved many notable book-plates during the last dozen years. The cottage is on a hillside, just above the quiet New Hampshire village of Chocorua…. I found him sitting beneath an apple tree, making studies of a grape vine that climbed over a boulder near by…. We passed through the spacious living-room, where hung water-colors, and prints from the book-plate work of some of the noted engravers, and continuing upstairs, reached the studio…. Mr. Spenceley placed four copper plates before me, each different in design. 'You see the variety, but each holds my interest. Perhaps I like landscape plates best, and grace and treatment of the sixth-century French designs appeal to me especially. However, to incorporate artistically the ideas of my clientele, I find it better to use various forms of design rather than to hold to any one style'…. It is small wonder one feels the exquisite harmony in his book-plates, for he is one of Nature's most earnest lovers, and only embodies in his work the happiest and most beautiful aspects of life."</p></bioghist></c></c><c id="aspace_ref8_mr4" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 2: Non-Illustrated Bookplates</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">9.5 Linear Feet</extent><extent altrender="carrier">in 19 manuscript boxes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1701/1936" type="inclusive">1701-circa 1936</unitdate><container id="aspace_624b528972b063caa5b9677b6aa09bae" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">Box 10-24, 44-45</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_545333b5998617d170e5dae745f9847a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Except where noted, these plates are mounted and do not include associated information about the subject.  The American bookplates were owned by men who lived primarily during the mid-19th century through the early 1930s, and include bookplates owned by surgeons, professors, bankers and editors.  The English owners lived primarily in the 19th century.  The unmounted plates include individual men's and institutional plates, and Box 44 and 45 have "unmounted duplicates," which include numerous Emma and Augustus Toedteberg duplicates and presentation plates to the Long Island Historical Society. </p><p>The plates of various states are printed directly to the paper rather than mounted. The "oversize" plates are printed on 8 x 11 cardstock. A "state" refers to the printing process, where an impression is made from the original design to create a print. Different states result from changes to the original design. Copies of many of these plates are boxed elsewhere in the collection. Included are several duplicates of Emma Toedteberg's personal bookplates, as well as the bookplates of ladies and institutions.</p><p>Box 45 includes correspondence between librarian Edna Huntington and the College of Arms in London, dated 1951, regarding Ms. Huntington's research request to identify a coat-of-arms depicted in a particular bookplate. The box also includes a letter to Emma Toedteberg from Northwestern University Library, dated April 24, 1922; and a handwritten note dated January 29, 1925, lacking letterhead.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e3e16c0a6e83fd8ce017c795781d7fb2"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Organized according to an original order of American bookplate owners, followed by English owners, unmounted bookplates, and bookplates of various states and sizes.

Some of the ladies' mounted plates include a handwriting sample.  While the men's bookplates are often of a more stately and familiar design, employing armorial patterns rooted in Western Europe, the ladies' bookplates tend to be of a more expressive and original nature, unconstrained by tradition. Topless sirens call to distant ships on the ladies' bookplates, where the men's show shields, lions' heads and foliage. Also, this collection includes the joint bookplates of married couples, which have been filed according to the wife rather than the husband.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref22_r5v" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mounted</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">0.75 Linear Feet</extent><extent altrender="carrier">in 1.5 manuscript boxes.</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation">1700s-1936</unitdate><container id="aspace_4810ce8369326e38692f9f0867edbaed" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">41-42</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref23_764" level="file"><did><unittitle>Unmounted</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">0.5 Linear Feet</extent><extent altrender="carrier">in 1 manuscript box</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation">1700s-1936</unitdate><container id="aspace_b13191476e954f3681c7d0b821d4009f" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">25</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref11_vl9" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 5: Institutional Bookplates</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">0.75 Linear Feet</extent><extent altrender="carrier">in 1.5 manuscript boxes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1759/1936" type="inclusive">1759-1936</unitdate><container id="aspace_2b2bd9cbe001be210c9ede522bd2ad2a" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">42-43</container></did><arrangement id="aspace_5d3335995491a2dffde6c86489a71f4b"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Loosely alphabetized by bookplate owner.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_718bbe83b310e68b762e5ae138b3651f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>These institutions include libraries, societies, colleges &amp; universities, private clubs and museums: the Brooklyn Historical Society (previously known as the Long Island Historical Society); the Bohemian Club, San Francisco, CA; the Newark, NJ Free Public Library; the Salmagundi Club; the gift-plate of the YMCA; and the Society of Mayflower Descendants.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref12_ive" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 6: Indexes and Papers</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 Linear Feet</extent><extent altrender="carrier">in 3 manuscript boxes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1930s-1982</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_12874215fde645ec383dc92c58bfd890"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The indexes are filed in original order by subject, and arranged according to either a primary (Box 46) or supplementary (Box 47) relationship to each series in the collection.

However, these indexes are sometimes inconsistent with the physical collection at the item level. For instance, the "Illustrated" index lists both the owner and the engraver, and though the particular plate is indexed under "Illustrated," it will be filed in the collection under the series "Engravers of Bookplates." Lionel W. Rothschild is indexed under "Illustrated," yet his bookplate is boxed under Sherborn (in which index Rothschild is not listed). The same is found for several other "Illustrated" plates, which are boxed under the engraver.  Conversely, Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt is indexed in "Illustrated" and though engraved by Sidney L. Smith, Mrs. Roosevelt is also boxed in "Illustrated." Such cross-indexing recurs in the collection, and requires the researcher to check multiple indexes and boxes before finding the physical location of a particular plate.</p><p>The J.W. Spenceley index is marked at the top in pencil, "not in Miss Toedteberg's list," which description may also apply to the indexes for all engravers' collections. The French index is pencil marked to note that Emma's bookplate has been added to the collection. The Sidney L. Smith index has been previously amended in pencil where the listings are out of alphabetical order. However, the bookplates in the boxes are alphabetized according to the pre-amended indexing order, which might suggest that the author of the original index also boxed the collection. Unlike the French collection, which indicates a post-Emma stage of processing, here the Smith box follows the original index.</p><p>Finally, many of the indexes show traces of having been updated. For example, some are marked in pencil to indicate mistakes in alphabetization, and some show typewritten amendations to the lists.  A reference to the "unmarked green box" remains a mystery.</p><p>Box 48 contains bookplates and correspondence acquired by Harriet Stryker-Rodda, Long Island Historical Society librarian in the 1960s. Numerous unmounted and uncollected bookplates are included, as well as a one-page outline of the materials and a detailed index of the bookplates.</p></scopecontent></c></dsc>
