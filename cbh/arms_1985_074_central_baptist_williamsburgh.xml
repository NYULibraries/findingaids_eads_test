    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Central Baptist Church of Williamsburgh was founded in July of 1865 by former members of the First Baptist Church of Williamsburgh. By July of 1866, the church was able to purchase the building formerly occupied by the Reformed Church, located on South Second Street in what is now the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. In the same year, the church appointed Thomas A.T. Hanna to serve as its first pastor. During Hanna's first three and a half years of ministry, membership grew from 57 to nearly 200. The church also gained attention for drawing in new members who were originally from other religious denominations.</p>  </bioghist>
