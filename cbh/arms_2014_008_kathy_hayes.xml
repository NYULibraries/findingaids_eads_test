He was born on January 1, 1913, in New York City and was raised in Hurleyville, NY. He graduated from Brooklyn College (1931-1935), New York University (1936), and the University of Michigan (1937-1938), where he won the Avery Hopwood Award for his drama and poetry. He returned to New York in 1939, and was named a winner in the Yale Series of Younger Poets in 1940. In 1941, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. His work was published and performed from the 1940s to the 1980s. His poetry was published in The New Yorker, and his play, "Mister Johnson," opened on Broadway in 1956.
