    <head>Oral History note</head>
<p>Oral history interviews are intimate conversations between two people, both of whom have generously agreed to share these recordings with the Brooklyn Historical Society archives and with researchers. Please listen in the spirit with which these were shared. Researchers will understand that:</p><p>1. The Brooklyn Historical Society abides by the General Principles &amp; Best Practices for Oral History as agreed upon by the Oral History Association (2009) and expects that use of this material will be done with respect for these professional ethics.</p><p>2. Every oral history relies on the memories, views and opinions of the narrator. Because of the personal nature of oral history, listeners may find some viewpoints or language of the recorded participants to be objectionable. In keeping with its mission of preservation and unfettered access whenever possible, BHS presents these views as recorded.</p><p>3. Transcripts created prior to 2008 or by a thrird-party serve as a guide to the interview and are not considered verbatim. The audio recording should be considered the primary source for each interview. It may contain natural false starts, verbal stumbles, misspeaks, repetitions that are common in conversation, and other passages and phrases omitted from the transcript. This decision was made because BHS gives primacy to the audible voice and also because some researchers do find useful information in these verbal patterns.</p><p>4. Unless these verbal patterns are germane to your scholarly work, when quoting from this material researchers are encouraged to correct the grammar and make other modifications maintaining the flavor of the narrator's speech while editing the material for the standards of print.</p>  </odd>

    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Patricia Carino Pasick was born in Queens, New York to a Filipino American father (born and raised in Brooklyn) and a mother of Scotch-Irish and English descent (born and raised in Tennessee). Her family moved to West Islip (Long Island) when she was a young child. Later her family relocated to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where her father worked in the aerospace industry. She is a graduate of the University of Michigan (bachelor's degree and PhD.) and Harvard University (Master in Education). As a psychologist, she became interested in her own heritage, and began investigating the roots of the Filipino American community, which resulted in this collection of oral histories. Pasick also contributed historical essays on the Filipino American community in In Our Uncles' Words: We Fought For Freedom, which was published by the Filipino American National Historical Society - Hampton Roads Chapter.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>In the years following the Philippine-American War (1899-1902), many Filipino men found work with the U.S. Navy and Merchant Marine as cooks and stewards (the only positions Filipinos could hold until 1973). As a result, Filipino American communities began to arise in U.S. port cities. In Brooklyn, these men resided in boarding houses near the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Some of the men married American women and started mixed ethnic families. The community generally resided on Johnson Street in the Downtown neighborhood of Brooklyn, and a Filipino American community center on Fulton Street served as a gathering place for families. By the mid-twentieth century, the community began to leave Brooklyn for suburban communities in Queens, Long Island, and beyond.</p><p>Source:

The area where she resided was very ethnically mixed at the time. She explains that it was not until junior high school (by which time she had moved to Brooklyn) that students started to categorize each other into different ethnic groups. She then recounts how both her parents died in 1952 and being taken in (along with her brother) by her mother's close friend, Aunt Marion, who was of mixed Filipino/German descent and married to a Filipino. The interview was conducted by Patricia Carino Pasick at Ball's home in Lakewood Ranch, Florida.</p><p>Please note that the recording of the interview is cut short by approximately one minute.

Her mother, Ella Santos, was born in Hungary in 1912, into a mixed family. Her maternal grandmother was Hungarian and her maternal grandfather was Filipino. Her father, Luciano Pineda, was also born in the Philippines, in 1908. She attended PS 112 Grammar School for two years and Santa Maria Catholic School for two years in the Bronx. After losing both parents to illness in 1952, Ball and her brother moved to the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn to live with their mother's godmother, Marion del Rosario (who was of mixed Filipino/German descent) and her husband Herman (a Filipino). There she attended PS 12, Montauk Junior High School (JHS 223), and Bay Ridge High School. After school she worked as a secretary for New York State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz, and then as a secretary in the Patent Department of the Union Carbide Corporation. She married Louis Tochet and then relocated to Chicago, Illinois. They had two children, Noelle (born in 1965) and Peter (born in 1966). She and Louis divorced in 1983, and she then married Robert Ball in 1987, who had four children from a previous marriage: John, Jeffrey, Judy, and Jim.
