On December 2, 1905, Mrs. Tunis G. Bergen brought together a group of Brooklyn residents at the Barnard Club House on Remsen Street to form New York City's first borough-based Red Cross organization. With an initial membership roster of 300, the Brooklyn Chapter of the American Red Cross embarked on its first major campaign to aid victims of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, collecting over $100,000 and thousands of articles of clothing to contribute to the relief effort.</abstract>
