      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>Emmanuel House was located at 131 Steuben Street in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. As a civic center and place of outreach run by the Young Men's League of the Emmanuel Baptist Church, the Emmanuel House offered Sunday school, Kindergarten and recreational classes to children of the church and neighborhood. Emmanuel House was demolished in the mid 20th century during an expansion of the neighboring Pratt Institute, at which time outreach and recreational activities were resumed at the Emmanuel Baptist Church.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Emmanuel House lantern slide collection contains 87 slides dated circa 1900 to 1914. The slides contain photographs of children at the Emmanuel House, their activities, interior and exterior shots of the building, as well as a small number of illustrations and reproduced sheet music. The majority of the images in the collection are group portraits of clubs and classes at Emmanuel House, such as the Kindergarten, Sunday school, sewing school, scouts, and baseball team. In addition to group portraits, the collection includes informal photographs of the clubs' recreational activities, such as camping and swimming. Some slides originate from commercial slide studios, namely the Radio Mat Slide Company and Charles A. Beseler.</p>
