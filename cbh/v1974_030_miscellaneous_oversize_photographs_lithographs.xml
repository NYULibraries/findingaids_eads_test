    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Miscellaneous oversize photographs and lithographs consists of 32 items, dating from circa 1870 to 1965, and measuring .5 linear feet. The majority of images are black-and-white, though there are several hand colored photographs. The collection is comprised of both photographic prints and lithographs. Subjects range from studio portraits, to views of buildings located in New York City, to views of parks and waterways in Brooklyn and New York City. The only cohesive element shared by all of the images is their size, though most are also related in that they are primarily depicting locations and people related to Brooklyn and New York City.</p>  </scopecontent>
