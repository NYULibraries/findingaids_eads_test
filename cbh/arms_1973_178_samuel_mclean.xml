<p>Samuel McLean (1820-1893) was a Brooklyn merchant who worked in the dry goods trade with the firm William Turnbull &amp; Co.  He later went into partnership with Frank Woodruff in the storage warehouse business.  McLean was an active member of the Hamilton Literary Association, a Brooklyn debating society, and was the first president of the Hamilton Club, a social club that later absorbed the Hamilton Literary Association.  McLean was also active in the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) and was a member of Brooklyn's Grace Church.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
