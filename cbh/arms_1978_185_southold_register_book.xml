    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The area that is now Southold, Long Island, NY was originally inhabited by the Algonquin people. The first European settlers arrived in 1638 and established two small farms in the Hashamomuck area. In 1640, Reverend John Young, originally from Southwold, England, gained the backing of the Colony of New Haven in what is now Connecticut to establish a "plantation" or sub-colony across the Long Island Sound on the North Fork of Long Island. </p><p>New Haven Colony provided the funds to purchase rights to use the land from both the local Native American Sachems and from James Farrett, the representative of the Earl of Stirling, who had been given the island by the British Crown. The community was first known as Yennicott. The government of Southold Town was formed in 1649, when the plantation felt established enough to purchase its independence from New Haven. </p><p>At that time, the town stretched across approximately 63 miles from Fishers Island to what is now Wading River. In 1792, the town petitioned New York State to divide into two parts. Southold Town went on to have success as farming and fishing community.  Since the mid- 20th century, viniculture has become one of the largest crops of the North Fork, including in Southold.</p>    <list type="ordered">
