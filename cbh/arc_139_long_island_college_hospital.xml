    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Long Island College Hospital was founded in 1858 and functioned as both a hospital and medical school.  Its original building was located on the west side of Henry Street between Pacific and Amity Streets in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Cobble Hill.  </p><p>Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, as the Hospital acquired additional departments and facilities, it achieved several distinctions in the advancement of institutional medical care: in 1860, for example, the Hospital became the first in the United States to implement bedside teaching as an integral part of its medical curriculum.  Later, the Hospital helped pioneer the early use of the stethoscope and anesthesia.  </p><p>In 1931, the Hospital's medical school became independent of the Hospital and was incorporated as the Long Island College of Medicine.  Later in 1950, the College became part of the State University of New York (SUNY), and in the ensuing years the College's campus was relocated to the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in the Brooklyn neighborhood of East Flatbush.  </p><p>As of 2010, the College remains a unit of the SUNY Downstate Medical Center, though it continues to have a teaching affiliation with the Long Island College Hospital, now located at 339 Hicks Street.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
