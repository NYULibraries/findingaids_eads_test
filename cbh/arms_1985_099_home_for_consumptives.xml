    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Home for Consumptives was incorporated as The Garfield Memorial Home on October 6, 1881 with the mission of providing shelter and care for tuberculosis patients and sufferers of other chronic ailments who could not find adequate care elsewhere. It was renamed the Brooklyn Home for Consumptives in 1882, and again renamed The Brooklyn Thoracic Hospital in 1938. The Home was originally located at 219 Raymond Street, and subsequently moved to a new building on Kingston Avenue in 1887, where the Home would remain until it closed in 1955. In 1956, the Brooklyn Thoracic Hospital merged with the Brooklyn Hospital, bringing the staff and trustees of both institutions together under one roof. As of 2010, the Brooklyn Hospital is still in operation and is known as the Brooklyn Hospital Center.</p>  </bioghist>
