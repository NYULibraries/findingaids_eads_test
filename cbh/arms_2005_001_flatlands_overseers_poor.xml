<p>Late eighteenth and early nineteenth century laws, such as those of New York State, established that local municipalities were responsible for relief of their poor residents. Overseers of the Poor were elected or named by each municipality to manage the program. "Outdoor relief," or direct support of the poor outside of an institutional structure such as an almshouse, was a common approach for towns to use. Such support could take the form of cash or goods provided to individual residents, but might also include arranging for their boarding. (See Raymond A. Mohl's <emph render="italic">Poverty in New York, 1783-1825</emph>, especially Chapter 4.)</p><p>In Flatlands, Overseers of the Poor existed from at least 1807 when the records in this collection indicate the establishment of a poor fund with 75 dollars. The Overseer position was abolished by the town on April 5, 1831, and the fund closed shortly after. (See the Garret Baxter entry for that date in the abstracts from his journal; typescript version in BHS at call number F129.B7.F529, page 109.) Among the individuals holding the position of Overseer over time were Garret Baxter, Abraham Wyckoff, and John H. Lott.</p>  </bioghist>
