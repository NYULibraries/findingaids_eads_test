    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Carlo and Elisa Rainone immigrated from Italy in 1890 and 1888 respectively. In 1910 they were settled at 100 Ralph Avenue in Brooklyn, with a large family, supported by Carlo's work as a barber. Their daughter Mary, born around 1898, would later marry pharmacist Ernest Morra, some of whose papers are included in this collection. Other family members were Lucy Beatrice (b. September 29, 1898,), Michael C. (b. 1900), Carmela (b. 7 Jan 1901), Adelina (born Feb 2 or 7, 1902), and Julia A. (b. 1903).</p><p> Michael C. went to Bushwick High School and studied medicine at the New York Homeopathic Medical College and Flower Hospital, graduating in 1928, and obtaining his New York State license to practice medicine in 1930. He enjoyed bowling and was President of the Silver Dollar Club of Kings County in 1942.</p><p> Julia, born 23 Feb 1903, worked in the New York City School system, whether as a teacher or a clerical assistant is not clear. Lucy was a stenographer who aspired to be a published author, with little or no success. She seems to have enjoyed reading horoscopes, belonged to a Republican Club, was a practicing Catholic and gave money to at least one Catholic charity.</p><p> By 1930 Mary was married and the rest of the family had moved to 844 Putnam Avenue. She and her husband Ernest Morra (born 24 Feb 1894), a pharmacist sometimes referred to as "Dr. Morra," lived at 259 Stuyvesant Avenue. Ernest Morra managed a branch of Liggett's Drug Store located at 954 Madison Avenue in Manhattan. Evidently a successful businessman, he received numerous letters from the management of Liggett's congratulating him on increased revenues, and by the late 1920s was buying shares in pharmaceutical companies.</p><p> Carlo Rainone died on February 23, 1945 at the family home on Putnam Avenue and was interred at St. John's Cemetery. At some point thereafter, Julia, Lucy, Carmela (sometimes called Camilla) and Adelina moved to 11201 84th Avenue, Jamaica, Queens, where Lucy died in June of 1973. Camilla followed in March 1976. Adelina passed away in February 1980 and Julia in October 1981. Ernest Morra also died in Queens in March 1984.</p>  </bioghist>
