    <abstract id="aspace_2413f6de4936edbb5b6fae91010f56b2">Epher Whitaker (1820-1916) was pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Southold, Long Island, for more than forty years, retiring the pastorate in 1891. He was also an author and historian. The Epher Whitaker papers (1864-1900) include manuscripts of fourteen of Whitaker's sermons, lectures and short writings dating from the late 1800s. There is also a small amount of correspondence from 1864 concerning religious revival among children. Most of the lectures and sermons concern historical topics, including past ministers at Southold and Shelter Island; preachers who appeared in the pulpit of the First Presbyterian Church of Southold, including African-Americans; the history of the First Presbyterian; and a survey of Suffolk County history. A summary of remarks entitled "The Proper Work of the Ministry" is an autobiographical account of Whitaker's career (1891). Other manuscript remarks include reflections on "The Rise of Woman" and the relation of church and state, as well as religious themes.</abstract>

<p>It is unknown as to how the material came to Brooklyn Historical Society. Whitaker was a councillor of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) so it is plausible that the documents were donated by him.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Epher Whitaker papers include manuscripts of fourteen of Whitaker's sermons, lectures and short writings dating from the late 1800s. There is also a small amount of correspondence from 1864 concerning religious revival among children. Most of the lectures and sermons concern historical topics, including past ministers at Southold and Shelter Island, Long Island; preachers who appeared in the pulpit of the First Presbyterian Church of Southold, including African-Americans; the history of the First Presbyterian; financial relief for ministers in historical context; and a survey of Suffolk County history (1900) with Whitaker's thoughts on commerce, agriculture, seafaring, churches, public schools, and other developments over time in the county. A summary of remarks entitled "The Proper Work of the Ministry" is an autobiographical account of Whitaker's career (1891). Other manuscript remarks include an argument for an endowment to fund a department at the Suffolk County Historical Society for the study of "The Rise of Woman"; reflections on the relation of church and state, and sermons on religious themes, some noting the various locations and dates the sermons were delivered.</p>  </scopecontent>
