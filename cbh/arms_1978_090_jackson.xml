<p>Theodore F. Jackson (1830-1913) was a prominent lawyer in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg.  He studied law in Manhasset, Long Island under Judge Onderdonk and in 1852 was admitted to the bar. He formed a partnership with Paul J. Fish in Williamsburg, which was dissolved in 1860.  After practicing alone for 14 years, Jackson formed a partnership with Joseph A. Burr in 1874.  In 1881, Jackson was appointed Registar of Arrears by Brooklyn Mayor Seth Low, and in 1889 he was elected Comptroller.  He was also Director of the First National Bank of the City of Brooklyn, the Williamsburgh Trust Co., the Long Island Loan and Trust Co., and the New York and East River Ferry Co., of which he was also President.  He was also a member of the Sons of the Revolution and the Hamilton and Hanover Clubs.  Jackson retired in 1893.</p>  </bioghist>
