    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>James Albert Riley (J.A.R.) Elliott (1854-1924) was one of the premier live-bird and trap shooters in America from the late 1880s until his retirement in 1915. In the late 19th century, live pigeon shooting was a popular competitive sport and Elliott was a celebrated national champion.  Elliott earned a living by competing for prize money and through his longstanding employment as a representative of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.  By about 1910,  shooting live birds was increasingly considered cruel and the sport began to shift to shooting clay targets or skeet shooting. Elliott's shooting career became less active and in 1911 he launched a new business venture, Elliott's Perfect Ear Protector. The ear protector, which he patented in the U.S. and eight other countries, was designed to protect the inner ear from the damage caused by the shock of loud noises, such as gun fire. The business was a commercial success and Elliott's customers ranged from local gun clubs to the U.S. military. Elliott moved from Kansas City, MO to Brooklyn, N.Y. in about 1910 and purchased a large stone mansion at 122 76th Street in the neighborhood of Bay Ridge. He died in Brooklyn on August 7, 1924.</p>  </bioghist>
