    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Cadman Plaza Complex refers to a series of apartment buildings and townhouses located between Cadman Plaza West and Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights. These buildings--Cadman Plaza North (140 Cadman Plaza West), Whitman Close (75 Henry Street), and Cadman Towers (101 Clark Street and 10 Clinton Street)--were constructed in the late 1960s where the Brooklyn Bridge trolley terminal once stood. The buildings were funded as part of the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program, providing affordable housing to middle-income residents. During the time period covered in the collection, the buildings were newly inhabited.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Cadman Plaza Complex resident newsletters date from 1969 to 1981 and measure 0.21 linear feet. The collection consists of tenant and owner newsletters, titled <emph render="italic">Cadman Views</emph> and <emph render="italic">Cadman Complex</emph>. From its first issue to November 1970, <emph render="italic">Cadman Views</emph> was published by Cadman Plaza North tenants and co-op owners. In December 1970, <emph render="italic">Cadman Views</emph> absorbed the neighboring Whitman Close resident newsletter, evolving into a publication for both properties. With the February 1978 issue, <emph render="italic">Cadman Views</emph> was re-named <emph render="italic">Cadman Complex</emph> and devoted an equal amount of space to residents in Cadman Plaza North, Whitman Close, and Cadman Towers. The newsletters contain editorials, letters from residents, and brief articles. Information in the newsletters detail the activities and social gatherings of residents as well as neighborhood issues such as schools, sidewalk maintenance, and security.</p>  </scopecontent>
