    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Miklos Suba was an Hungarian-American artist, born in Szatmar, Hungary, on April 1, 1880. He studied architecture at the Royal Hungarian Technical University of Budapest, graduating in 1902. In 1903, he studied painting at the Vienna Academy, before returning to Budapest to work as an architect. In World War I he served in the Astro-Hungarian army. He married an American woman, May, and in 1913 fathered a daughter, Susanne. The Suba family immigrated to the United States in 1924, settling in Brooklyn, New York. Inspired by his new surroundings, he began painting in what would become known as the Precisionist style. His work has been exhibited in numerous galleries and museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston), the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Brooklyn Museum. He died on July 18, 1944.</p>    <list type="ordered">
