    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Edna Glyde photography collection dates from circa 1940 to 1967 and contains 197 items. The collection consists of color slides, negatives, contact sheets, and black-and-white prints by resident Edna Glyde, with cityscapes and images of urban conditions in Brooklyn during the mid 20th century.  </p><p>Prints, contact sheets, and film negatives date from the World War II and postwar era, and document the Brooklyn Heights, Downtown, Fulton Ferry, and Navy Yard areas of Brooklyn. A large portion of the prints and negatives are street scenes, with images of sidewalks, storefronts, street vendors, and residents. Many street scenes show snowstorms and winter scenes in the neighborhoods. Exterior shots of Brooklyn Heights homes concentrate on architectural details, such as ironwork, stoops, and decorative accents. In addition, rooftop views from Brooklyn Heights provide limited skyline views of Brooklyn. These images also show signs of change and growth in the borough during the 1940s and 1950s, such as food ration notices during World War II, the elevated subway lines prior to demolition, the newly-constructed Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, and abandoned or demolished buildings. Businesses, warehouses, and small construction projects in these neighborhoods are also depicted. A small number of prints and negatives show the Coney Island and Bath Beach neighborhoods of Brooklyn as well.</p><p>Color slides in the collection date from 1964 to 1967. These images concentrate largely on the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, especially around Columbia Heights and the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. These slides show views of the New York Harbor, Manhattan skyline, piers, and the Brooklyn Bridge. A small number of slides also show the Margate, NJ attraction, Lucy the Elephant.</p>  </scopecontent>
