    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Lexow Committee was a legislative committee from 1894-1895, named for and chaired by State Senator Clarence Lexow. Driven by Charles H. Parkhurst's City Vigilance League, the committee exposed widespread corruption in the New York City police force, including vice operations, rigged elections, and physical brutality. As a result, Tammany Hall was defeated in the following election and reform Mayor William Strong was elected. Theodore Roosevelt took over as police commisioner and instituted extensive reform efforts.</p><p>The Sun newspaper was printed from 1833 to 1950.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
