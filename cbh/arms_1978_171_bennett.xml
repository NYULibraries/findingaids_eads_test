<p>On October 17, 1911 the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that negotiations were under way to bring Daniel H. Burnham, then president of the Fine Arts Commission of the U.S., to Brooklyn to consult with a committee of citizens on the borough's development and city planning. In January 1912 the committee was formalized and held its first meeting. The by-laws then established named the organization the Brooklyn Committee on City Plan and its officers were chosen, including president Frederic B. Pratt. The committee consulted with both Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett in its work to develop Brooklyn.</p>    <list type="ordered">
