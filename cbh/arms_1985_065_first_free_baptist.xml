      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The First Free Baptist Church of Brooklyn was established in 1885 and was located at Marcy Avenue and Keap Street in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg.  The church's prior history had been filled with several name and location changes.  It was originally named the Lee Avenue Baptist Church, but due to the liberal views of its pastor, the Reverend J. Hyatt Smith, the church was expelled from the Long Island Baptist Association and was removed from its Lee Avenue building.  Several members of the dispersed congregation then regrouped as the South Baptist Church.  After purchasing a building on Hooper Street and Harrison Avenue, the church acquired the leadership of a new pastor, the Reverend Rivington D. Lord, and became the Hooper Street Free Baptist Church.  The church later took on its final name of the First Free Baptist Church of Brooklyn, and moved into its Marcy Avenue location to house its growing congregation.  Under Reverend Lord's leadership, the church continued to enjoy steady growth and was notable for being the only church in Brooklyn to allow members of other Christian denominations to receive communion (this being the reason for the inclusion of the word "free" in the name of the church).  In 1915, the church consolidated with the First Baptist Church of Williamsburg.</p>

      <p>The First Free Baptist Church of Brooklyn records span the period 1858 to 1918 and contain five bound, handwritten volumes documenting the church's activities throughout its many name and location changes.
