    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Gramercy Park is a neighborhood on the East Side of Manhattan.  Originally called Krom Moerasje (little crooked swamp) by Dutch settlers, it was renamed Gramercy by the English.  In the early 19th century, the swamp was drained and streets were laid out in an English style around a private park, leading to the present-day name of the neighborhood.</p>  </bioghist>
