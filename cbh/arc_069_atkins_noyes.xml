      <p>Th James Atkins Noyes collection spans 1865-1890, though the bulk of the collection pertains to Noyes' early life spent in Brooklyn, N.Y., 1865-1874. Included in the collection are 11 copybooks, one scrapbook, and one letter of correspondence. </p>
      <p>The copybooks consist of ten penmanship copybooks and one arithmetic copybook, 1865-1873. The scrapbook, compiled by Noyes from 1872-1875, contains advertising, trade, and calling cards, novelties including playing cards, printed images, postage stamps, playbills, tickets for admittance to events, and transportation tickets. Local subjects include the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Second Unitarian Church. Although most of the items in the scrapbook pertain to events or activities in Brooklyn or New York City, there are also admittance tickets for events in Boston, MA, 1873-1875. The scrapbook documents Noyes' activities and interests at the time of its compilation which included attending lectures on topics such as astronomy and religion. He was also interested in magic and printing.</p>
      <p>The correspondence consists of a letter sent from John White Chadwick (1840-1904) to Noyes, dated March 23, 1890. In the letter, Chadwick describes a recent sermon he gave at the Second Unitarian Church located in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. Chadwick was pastor at the church from 1864-1904.</p>
