    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Drake's Cakes was a brand of snack cakes founded in Brooklyn by Newman E. Drake in 1888. The company originally sold pound cake by the slice. An early iteration of the company was called Drake Brothers Co. located at 1006 Wallabout Market in Brooklyn. Around 1900, the company became Drake Bakeries, Inc. In 1903, the company built a factory and offices located at 77 Clinton Avenue on the border of the Fort Greene and Clinton Hill neighborhoods of Brooklyn. Well known products produced by the company included Ring Dings, Yodels, Devil Dogs, and coffee cake, all of which are still available today. Drake Bakeries were also one of the few kosher snack cake companies in the United States. In the 1960s, the company was sold to a large food manufacturing company. Over the years, the brand has been resold to various corporations. Today, the brand, now known just as Drake's, is owned by Hostess Brands. As of 2011, the Drake's Bakeries, Inc. factory is the home of the Benjamin Benneker Academy for Community Development.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Drake Bakeries photographs, dating from circa 1917 to 1949 and measuring .26 linear feet, consist of 61 black-and-white photographic prints documenting Drake Bakeries, Inc. Nearly all of the photographs measure 8" x 10" with the exception of three smaller prints and two oversize prints. Images include exterior and interior views of the factory that was located at 77 Clinton Avenue in Brooklyn. Front and back exterior views are included, as are interior views of the mixing room and mixing machines, dough production areas, wrapping machines, ovens, and shipping rooms with conveyor belts. Some of the photographs depict workers on the job at the factory. The collection also includes photographic copy prints of illustrated advertisements for Drake's Cakes, as well as photographs documenting Drake's Cakes 9th annual "Kiddy Party"--a three day benefit for underprivileged children of the New York City metropolitan area. The event was held at Luna Park in Coney Island and it featured a no hands cake-eating contest that was held on September 8, 1941. Over 50,000 children attended the three day event. Images of local celebrity cake-eating contest judges, a NBC radio show during production, and two group portraits of Drake Bakeries employees--one of the Drake's Cakes sales force in front of the factory in June 1933 and the other of the 14th annual dinner for salesmen and department heads held on January 13, 1917--are also included in the collection. Descriptive information identifying people, places, and dates are glued to the back of some the photographs.</p>  </scopecontent>
