      <abstract id="aspace_f26fdca9f2cb9d9146ec4f021dd779eb">This collection includes recordings and transcripts of oral histories narrated by those in the Puerto Rican community of Brooklyn who arrived between 1917 and 1940. The Long Island Historical Society initiated the Puerto Rican Oral History Project in 1973, conducting over eighty interviews between 1973 and 1975. The oral histories often contain descriptions of immigration, living arrangements, neighborhood ethnicities, discrimination, employment, community development, and political leadership. Also included are newspaper clippings, brochures, booklets about Brooklyn's Puerto Rican community, and administrative information on how the project was developed, carried out, and evaluated.</abstract>

      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Puerto Rican Oral History Project began with grant funding from the New York State Council on the Arts. Awarded in 1973, the purpose of the grant was to conduct interviews with Puerto Ricans who settled in Brooklyn between 1917 and 1940. Sixty-nine individuals were interviewed as part of the original scope of the project with each individual assigned a number identifier from 1 to 69. The number of participants later expanded due to the continued interest of project interviewer John D. Vazquez. Mr. Vazquez, the Director of the Department of Puerto Rican Studies at New York City Community College (NYCCC), taught an oral history course in the Spring of 1975 that required his students to interview Puerto Rican residents of Brooklyn: these interviews are also included in the collection. </p>
      <p>Of the first sixty-nine interviews, nine were conducted between April and August 1973 before the project was shelved until 1974. The 1973 interviews were usually conducted in paired teams by Elba Correa, Mayda Cortiella, Pedro Rivera, Tomas Rivera, Ms.Torres, and Ms. Ruiz. Other than their names, little information is available about these interviewers. When the project resumed in January of 1974, it had difficulty retaining staff. Project coordinator Anthony Cucchiara hired two college students to conduct interviews. These students left the project after one month having conducted only one interview. They were replaced by Roberto Rosado, an instructor at NYCCC, who was able to carry out two interviews before leaving the project in May 1974. In June, another instructor from NYCCC, Monte Rivera, another NYCCC instructor conducted an additional seven interviews over the course of one month before resigning. Finally, Jaime Barreto, a Brooklyn Public School Coordinator, and John Vazquez conducted the remaining fifty interviews that comprised the project's original scope. </p>
      <p>Interviews were conducted in Spanish, English, or both. In 1974, Maria C. Ramos and William Santos were hired to transcribe and translate interviews. These transcriptions are handwritten. Additional interview transcriptions come from a typed series which were done by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College when the interview tapes were on loan to that institution in 1984. Typed transcripts are in the language of the interview, without English translation. There is some overlap between handwritten transcriptions done by Ramos and Santos and those from the Hunter series resulting in interviews with multiple transcripts attached to them. </p>
      <p>The interview with José Ramón Giboyeaux in the original scope was transcribed only. Two interviews in the original scope were found to have no extant content on audiotape or in transcription. It is not known whether interviews with Rosendo Acosta or Gregorio Martínez were erased by accident or entirely redacted on purpose.</p>
      <p>Of the interviews done as part of Mr. Vazquez's course at NYCCC, four participants carried over from the original sixty-nine. Transcripts of two interviews in this series were possibly made as a result of the loan to Hunter College. Besides these two transcripts the rest of the interviews recorded for Mr. Vazquez's course are not transcribed. In 1983, four additional interviews were added to the collection, in transcript form only.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Long Island Historical Society initiated the Puerto Rican Oral History Project in 1973. Using funding from the New York State Council on the Arts, over eighty interviews were conducted documenting the experiences of Brooklyn residents who arrived from Puerto Rico between 1917 and 1940. This collection includes recordings and transcripts of interviews conducted primarily between 1973 and 1975.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement id="aspace_729feba166f2a8405f1f1d9457f97add">
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection contains digitized content of ninety-six interviews, printed transcripts for sixty-four interviews, printed ephemera including newspaper clippings, brochures, booklets, and administrative materials. The collection is arranged thematically into five series: 1) Oral Histories, 1973-1975, 2) Oral Histories, 1975-1983, 3) Transcripts, 1973-1975, 1983, 4) Puerto Rican Community, 1960-1983, and 5) Administrative materials, 1968-1984. Interview recordings were originally made on compact cassette tapes and are housed separately.</p>
      <p><emph render="bolditalic">Series 1: Oral Histories, 1973-1975</emph> makes up the bulk of the collection. There is audio for sixty-six interviews and a transcript only for one interview, all conducted for the original scope of the project. A complete listing of each interview with a biographical note, scope and content note, and subject headings follows. Interviews are also described in the Past Perfect archives catalog, including the audio and transcription where available. Digitized oral histories in Series 1 are in alphabetical order by narrator name. </p>
      <p><emph render="bolditalic">Series 2: Oral Histories, 1975</emph> is a series of audio recordings for twenty-five interviews and transcripts for two of those interviews, all conducted as follow-up to the original scope of the project by students of John D. Vazquez. Digitized oral histories in Series 2 are not arranged. </p>
      <p><emph render="bolditalic">Series 3: Transcripts, 1973-1975, 1983</emph> is a series of handwritten and/or printed transcripts for fifty-nine of the sixty-nine original participants and an additional six transcripts from interviews conducted outside the original scope of the project. For a complete listing about translations, participants, and dates of the interview, please see the Index file in this series. Abstracts of the interviews conducted with the original sixty-nine are also included in this series. Folders are organized according to the project number assigned to each narrator. Each folder contains all available transcripts for that interview. See separate appendix for inventory of recordings. Transcripts in Series 3 are arranged according to the original project number assigned to each narrator. Those transcripts outside the original project are in chronological and alphabetical order. </p>
      <p><emph render="bolditalic">Series 4: Puerto Rican Community, 1960-1983</emph> consists of printed ephemera related to the Puerto Rican Community. Items include brochures, booklets, and fliers for Puerto Rican Studies programs at academic and cultural institutions in the New York City area and in Puerto Rico. Newspaper clippings in this series are divided into those focusing on New York's Puerto Rican community and press on Long Island Historical Society's Puerto Rican Oral History Project. This series also includes a booklet published in English and Spanish entitled "Danger in Puerto Rico." The work is by Ramon Colón, one of the original sixty-nine interviewed for the project. Folders in Series 4 are arranged chronologically and thematically when appropriate.</p>
      <p><emph render="bolditalic">Series 5: Administrative materials, 1968-1984</emph> includes all retained materials that went into the funding and implementation of the project. Several folders in this series are devoted to information about the project's participants. Interviewer John Vazquez created critique forms for all the sixty-nine original participants. Those worksheets and any background information material collected on narrators are included here and organized according to the project number assigned to the individual. Background information on those narrators outside the original scope of the project are filed together and arranged alphabetically. These materials were most likely generated as part of course taught by Mr. Vazquez at New York City Community College. Any information worksheets filled out on individuals who were not interviewed are filed separately. Also found in this series is information on project personnel, financing, and other oral history projects. A file of project reports consists of updates from three different perspectives: project coordinator Anthony Cucchiara, interviewer John Vazquez, and student worker Julio Gonzalez. Folders in Series 5 are arranged chronologically and thematically when appropriate.</p>

      <p>Las siguientes historias orales son conversaciones íntimas entre dos personas quienes generosamente han consentido a compartirlas con el archivo del Sociedad Histórica de Brooklyn e investigadores. Por favor escuche con la intención con que las entrevistas fueron compartidas. Investigadores deben entender que:</p>
      <p>1. La Sociedad Histórica de Brooklyn se rige por los Principios generales y prácticas óptimas para historia oral como acordadas por la Asociación de Historial Oral (2009) y se espera que el uso de este material se lleve a cabo respetando estas éticas profesionales.</p>
      <p>2. Cada historia oral depende de las memorias y opiniones del narrador. Dada la naturaleza personal de la historia oral, los oyentes podrán encontrar que algunas opiniones o lenguaje utilizado por los narradores es objetable. De acuerdo la misión de preservación y acceso ilimitado, cuando posible, la Sociedad Histórica de Brooklyn presenta estas opiniones tal como fueron grabadas.</p>
      <p>3. Transcripciones creadas antes del 2008 sirven como guía a la entrevista y no son consideradas exactas. El audio debe ser considerado recurso principal de esta entrevista. La transcripción puede incluir comienzos falsos, tropiezos verbales, pronunciaciones incorrectas y repeticiones comunes en conversación. Esta decisión ha sido tomada ya que la Sociedad Histórica de Brooklyn da prioridad a la voz hablada y también porque algunos investigadores encuentran información valiosa en estos patrones verbales.</p>
      <p>4. A menos que estos patrones verbales sean pertinentes a su trabajo investigativo, se les exhorta a los investigadores a que corrijan la gramática y hagan otras modificaciones cuando citen, manteniendo el estilo de oratoria del narrador mientras editen el material para los estándares de escritura.</p>
      <p>Oral history interviews are intimate conversations between two people, both of whom have generously agreed to share these recordings with the Brooklyn Historical Society archives and with researchers. Please listen in the spirit with which these were shared. Researchers will understand that:</p>
      <p>1. The Brooklyn Historical Society abides by the General Principles &amp; Best Practices for Oral History as agreed upon by the Oral History Association (2009) and expects that use of this material will be done with respect for these professional ethics.</p>
      <p>2. Every oral history relies on the memories, views and opinions of the narrator. Because of the personal nature of oral history, listeners may find some viewpoints or language of the recorded participants to be objectionable. In keeping with its mission of preservation and unfettered access whenever possible, BHS presents these views as recorded.</p>
      <p>3. Transcripts created prior to 2008 serve as a guide to the interview and are not considered verbatim. The audio recording should be considered the primary source for each interview. It may contain natural false starts, verbal stumbles, misspeaks, repetitions that are common in conversation, and other passages and phrases omitted from the transcript. This decision was made because BHS gives primacy to the audible voice and also because some researchers do find useful information in these verbal patterns.</p>
      <p>4. Unless these verbal patterns are germane to your scholarly work, when quoting from this material researchers are encouraged to correct the grammar and make other modifications maintaining the flavor of the narrator's speech while editing the material for the standards of print.</p>

            <p>Ramón Acosta was born in Puerto Rico in 1880. He arrived in Brooklyn in September of 1927 aboard a German steamship. He first lived in the apartment of his brother-in-law Ramón Rodríguez on Hudson Avenue in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Vinegar Hill, later moving to Sands Street in what is now the neighborhood of DUMBO, and eventually settling in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Acosta worked for Acme Packing Corporation for decades, eventually retiring in 1955 when the company moved to St. Louis, Missouri. With his wife Flora Acosta, he was a parent of Celia Vice (1919-1993), a businesswoman, elected official, and community activist in the Puerto Rican community of New York.</p>

            <p>Ángel Arroyo arrived in New York City in October 1929 at the age of seventeen. He had a two-year college education, was a journalist for twenty years - including a stint as an editor and then columnist for Spanish-language daily El Diario - and considered himself a writer by trade. At the time of the interview in 1973 he was president of the Puerto Ricans Writers Association, had three of his poetry collections published, and was busy composing a book of poems on the Puerto Rican experience in New York City.</p>

            <p>In the interview, Ángel Arroyo looks back on his professional life - including twenty years as a journalist - reviewing events he helped to publicize for the mid-twentieth century's Hispanic population of New York City. He recalls his early work experience in factories and in the import-exporting business. While the interview's primary focus is autobiographical, there is significant attention paid to socioeconomic and political concerns of the Puerto Rican community, as well as Spanish-language media in the city. His career as a professional writer and poet is one that stands in contrast with that of many other migrants who, due to financial and familial obligations, were often unable to pursue a formal education.

            <p>Sister Carmelita Bonilla was born in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico in 1908. She journeyed to Brooklyn in 1923, becoming the first Puerto Rican Roman Catholic nun in New York City. During the height of the Great Depression of the 1930s, Bonilla ran a community center on Gold Street in the Vinegar Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn; organizing clubs and activities for impoverished residents - many from European immigrant backgrounds - and providing vital social services, both for existing ethnic enclaves as well as the fledgling Puerto Rican community. She was stationed at Saint Peter's Church at 117 Warren Street in Brooklyn's Columbia Waterfront District, where she offered religious instruction to parishioners, including many new arrivals from Puerto Rico. In 1967 she was assigned to St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church on Pacific Street in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. By that time, she had completed a bachelor's degree from the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras, and a master's degree from Santa María in Ponce. In 1991 she moved into the motherhouse of the Blessed Trinity Mother Missionary Cenacle in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She remained a member of the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity until her death in 2003.</p>

            <p>In the interview, Sister Carmelita Bonilla describes conditions for the residents of Brooklyn's waterfront during the 1920s and 1930s. The interview pays particular attention to the various personalities - including police, politicians and gangsters - she had to deal with in order to accomplish her social and religious work with the Catholic community at large, with the narration focusing on Bonilla's work with newly arrived migrants from her native Puerto Rico. She discusses neighborhood life and some local institutions, such as the Cumberland Hospital, and their relationship with the community. Bonilla also recalls details from her initial training and decision to join a religious order, her education, as well as her personal role in helping the poor and needy, particularly among New York's Puerto Ricans.

            <p>Julio Ferrell begins the interview by recounting the lives of family members who raised him in Puerto Rico. He shares his experiences as a rebellious young man who, on a whim, left Puerto Rico as stowaway in 1924 and wound up making a new life for himself in Brooklyn. Ferrell recounts the working conditions in Brooklyn's factories and describes his relations with bosses and co-workers of different ethnic backgrounds. He recalls housing conditions and rent prices in the 1920s and 1930s. Ferrell also touches on the subject of racial discrimination; both in Puerto Rico and in New York.

Loperena mentions specific factories which employed Puerto Ricans along with other ethnic groups. He gives a vivid account of discrimination faced by Puerto Ricans from Irish and Italians, and also touches on how the arrival of labor unions may have helped to alleviate prejudice against Puerto Ricans in the workplace.

            <p>Ángel Meléndez was born in Puerto Rico in 1897. He arrived in New York in 1923, briefly working at the Vanderbilt Hotel in Manhattan. After obtaining a better paying job at pharmaceutical company Pfizer's Flushing Avenue plant, he moved to Brooklyn in 1925. Meléndez was one of the first Puerto Ricans hired at Pfizer - which was located between the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant - and he lived in close proximity to the facility for the next forty-three years; thirty-five of which were spent working there. Meléndez retired in 1960 and eight years later moved to Corona, Queens. He was residing there at the time of the interview in 1974.</p>

The personal connections he made while working in local shops and delivering groceries throughout Brooklyn served him well, as he went on to found and/or participate in several civic and social organizations revolving around the Puerto Rican community. These include the Baldorioty Democratic Club, the Puerto Rican Civic Association, the Puerto Rican Merchants Association - in which Rivera served as the first president - and the Pan American Civic Association, which he founded after relocating to Eastern Long Island.</p>

            <p>María Rodríguez was born in Juana Díaz, Puerto Rico in 1911. She arrived in Brooklyn in 1945 and has lived there since her arrival. The daughter of farmers from the Puerto Rican countryside, she had limited educational opportunities and trained as a sewing machine operator. Rodríguez followed in the footsteps of an older sister and cousin by coming to New York, a move she says was made for the adventure rather than economic reasons. After first residing in the Bronx, she moved to Fulton Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.

            <p>Georgina Santiago was born in Coamo, Puerto Rico in 1890. She arrived in Brooklyn in April 1925 aboard the steamship San Lorenzo, and continued to reside in the borough at the time of the interview in 1974. Her husband Ramon Santiago - who died in 1944 - was a pioneering "Bodeguero" who opened up grocery stores that catered to the growing Spanish-speaking and Latin American population. He was also considered a benefactor among the Puerto Rican community. Santiago spent her first years in Brooklyn living in the Downtown area, later moving to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg - near the family store, which was located at the corner of Flushing Avenue and Bedford Avenue - and then a few blocks away in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant.</p>

Early and mid-20th century Puerto Rican political and social clubs - as well as Spanish-language news media - are also touched on.

            <p>Celia Maria Vice was born in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico in 1913. She arrived in Brooklyn at Pier Nine aboard a steam ship, and resided with her family in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of DUMBO and Vinegar Hill, later moving to the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant (where she lived at the time of the interview in 1974). Vice worked several factory and office jobs - including a position at a defense plant during World War II - before going into business for herself. She performed services including translating, as well as selling real estate - as the first Puerto Rican woman broker in Brooklyn - and insurance. She also remained extremely active in the community during her lifetime as a member of multiple citywide committees, including the New York City Human Rights Commission. Vice helped found a number of civic and cultural entities including the Puerto Rican Heritage Publishing Company, the Fernando Sierra Vardeci Independent Democratic Club, and el Museo del Barrio (a community museum) and was the first Latina grand marshal of the Puerto Rican Day Parade. She relocated back to Puerto Rico in 1979, establishing the Kiosko Cultural in the Plaza de Las Americas. Celia Maria Vice died in 1993.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>In the interview, Celia Vice discusses the social and economic situation for Puerto Ricans - and New Yorkers in general - during the 1920s and 1930s. She touches on work, health and housing conditions, as well as describes the ethnic composition of Downtown Brooklyn and its surrounding waterfront, which was the initial area of settlement for Brooklyn's Puerto Rican community. Vice provides detailed information on the cohesion, self-sustainability, and ultimate socioeconomic progress of Brooklyn's early Puerto Rican migrants; including descriptions of mutual aid, religion, child development, education, work ethic, cultural heritage and community organizing. Interview conducted by Ms. Torres and Ms. Ruiz.</p>

            <p>Born in 1922, Betty Villa (one of the few narrators in this collection to be a borough native) was raised in the Downtown section of Brooklyn. She later lived between the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant, before relocating to Carolina, Puerto Rico in the 1960s. While growing up in the 1920s and 1930s she experienced racial discrimination firsthand, both from individuals and institutions. Despite this, she made friends of all ethnic stripes - even once marching in the Saint Patrick's Day Parade - and attended Brooklyn College before joining the workforce. She was the mother of three children, as well as an activist in civic, political, and mutual aid organizations throughout her life.</p>

            <p>In the interview, Betty Villa describes the Downtown Brooklyn area of the 1920 and 1930s. She gives firsthand information on figures such as Sister Carmelita Bonilla, Celia Vice, Luis Hernández, and Antonia Denis, as well as an account of Reverend W.E. Davenport (a Brooklyn philanthropist who was somewhat active in the Eugenics movement). She refers to the first church serving Spanish-speaking Catholics in Brooklyn, Our Lady of Pilar. Villa recalls both her encounters with racism, as well as friendships across ethnic and racial lines. Villa also discusses Puerto Rican identity, politics, and society, as well as the experience of reverse migration to Puerto Rico from New York. Interview conducted by Jaime Barreto.</p>
