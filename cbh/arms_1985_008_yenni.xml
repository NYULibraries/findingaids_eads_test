    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Courtney Yenni papers contain one scrapbook, several theater programs and broadsides, one clipping and one magazine. The scrapbook seems to have been compiled at least in part by Yenni's half sister Gertrude "Gertie" Livingston Yenni, who died in 1878. It contains printed ephemera (some of which is quite colorful, and some of which has three dimensional elements), clippings (including several death and marriage notices for the Livingston and Yenni families), photographs and dried leaves.</p><p>The programs include the final performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Montague Street in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, as well as the first performance at its new building in the Fort Greene neighborhood. The final performance at the Academy featured the singer Adelina Patti, who is also the subject of the 1974 clipping in the collection. There is also a program from the inaugural performance at Radio City Music Hall, which opened in 1932.</p>  </scopecontent>
