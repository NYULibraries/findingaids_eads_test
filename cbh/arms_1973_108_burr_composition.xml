    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of one composition book kept by Joseph Arthur Burr, Jr. as a youth during the period 1860 to 1866, while he attended the Williamsburgh Institute in Brooklyn, N.Y. (1860-1864), and the Wilton Academy in Wilton, Connecticut (1864-1866). Burr's book includes short essays on a variety of topics, including descriptions of places and events in and around Brooklyn and New York. These include brief descriptions of the Japanese government's 1860 delegation in New York, Blackwell's Island (now Roosevelt Island), the 1864 Brooklyn and Long Island Sanitary Fair, local menageries, the brickyard at Verplanck's Point on the Hudson River, West Point, the launch of the frigate <emph render="italic">Re D'Italia</emph> from the Webb Shipyard, and the Morgan Iron Works. Some entries concern anniversary celebrations of the Williamsburg (i.e., Eastern District) Sunday School Union, one of which includes reference to the participation of an African-American school. Several entries are influenced by the progression of the Civil War and include reflections on some aspect of it; in perhaps the most notable of these entries, dating from Thanksgiving 1865, Burr reflected on the closing events of the war, including Lincoln's assassination. The book also includes pieces of fiction and essays with reflections on more abstract matters, such as perseverance, profanity, inventiveness, republican form of government, and human industry (in part contrasting northern labor against southern slavery).</p>  </scopecontent>
