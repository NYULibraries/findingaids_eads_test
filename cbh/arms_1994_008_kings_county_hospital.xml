<p>The collection contains an assortment of items relating to Kings County Hospital, dating from 1903 to the 1930s. It includes: one photograph album (assembled in the 1930s); one loose photograph of the exterior of the hospital (1930s); ephemera relating to the Eleventh Annual Dinner of the Kings County Hospital Alumni Association (1904); one clipping relating to bachelor doctors (1908); one clipping relating to club foot surgery at the hospital (1922); invitations to attend surgeries performed by Dr. A.T. Bristow (1904); a manual titled <emph render="italic">The Hospital Formulary of the Department of Public Charities and the Department of Bellevue and Allied Hospitals of the City of New York</emph> (sixth revised edition), by W.E. Dreyfus (1903); and a typescript titled <emph render="italic">History of Kings County Hospital from the Earliest Care of the Poor in the County until the Abolition of the Office of Superintendent of Poor, April 14th, 1871; Together with a Brief Summary of the Subsequent Events to 1922.</emph></p><p>Of particular note is the photograph album, which was assembled in the 1930s, but contains photographs dating back to the 1900s. It was likely assembled by Dr. Mortimer D. Jones, who was superintendent of the hospital from 1910 until 1929. The album documents the construction of the new hospital (completed in 1931) and other nearby medical buildings, doctors and patients, and other New York metropolitan area hospitals. It also features two photographs of an infant with congenital hydrocephalus, or enlarging of the head.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Mortimer D. Jones was born on May 3, 1877, in Brooklyn, New York. He was a graduate of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. Jones served as superintendent of the Cumberland Street Hospital until 1910, when he was appointed superintendent of Kings County Hospital. He was briefly relieved of his duties in 1928 following allegations of mismanagement and anti-Semitism. In 1929 he was named medical superintendent of City Hospital on Welfare Island (now known as Roosevelt Island), a position he held until he retired in 1934. He was married to the former Lillian Stephen and passed away in Ridgewood, New Jersey,  in 1953.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>"Twenty-One More Nurses." <emph render="italic">The Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph> (Brooklyn, New York), May 27, 1910.</p><p>"Dr. Jones Is Sent To Welfare Island Post By Schroeder." <emph render="italic">The Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph> (Brooklyn, New York), April 20, 1929.</p><p>"Dr. Mortimer D.
