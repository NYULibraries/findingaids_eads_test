    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Stereoscopy is a photographic technique that involves taking double photographs from slightly different perspectives that when viewed through a stereoscope (a viewer designed to view the photographs side-by-side, 2.5 inches apart, as the human eye would see it) creates the illusion of depth, thus tricking the brain into seeing one image that appears to have three dimensionality. Stereographs are double photographic prints that are mounted on sturdy cards to be placed into a stereoscope for viewing. Stereoscopic photographs are also double photographs, but can be daguerreotypes, negatives, or unmounted prints. Although early stereoscopy dates back to the 1830s, it did not become popular until the 1850s when a simpler and more accessible stereoscopic viewer was invented by Scottish scientist, David Brewer.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">

<p>Seth William Fox was a flour merchant who lived in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn where he purchased a brownstone circa 1885. Seth Fox married Elizabeth C. Fox (d. 1918) and they had at least three children; Arthur, William, and Jennie. In 1911, the Fox family moved to Palisades, N.Y. when Seth Fox purchased a 25-acre estate called Seven Oaks. </p><p>Elizabeth A. Finck (nee Fox; 1923-2005) was the granddaughter of Seth W. Fox. She married Arnold Finck in 1944 and was a longtime resident of Palisades, N.Y. Finck was an amateur historian and served as the chairperson of the Palisades Historical Committee for 25 years, beginning in 1961.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
