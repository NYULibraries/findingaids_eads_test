<p>The Brooklyn Heights Synagogue oral histories are comprised of eight interviews from ten members of the Brooklyn Heights Synagogue. The interviews were conducted by Sady Sullivan, Oral Historian, throughout 2010. In the interviews, narrators discuss growing up, how they came to be members of Brooklyn Heights Synagogue, the Brooklyn Heights Synagogue community, and changes in and around the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. Many narrators recall stories about how being members of the Synagogue effected their careers, dating and marriage, children, and social activities.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Oral History Note</head>
<p>Oral history interviews are intimate conversations between two people, both of whom have generously agreed to share these recordings with the Brooklyn Historical Society archives and with researchers. Please listen in the spirit with which these were shared. Researchers will understand that:</p><p>1. The Brooklyn Historical Society abides by the General Principles &amp; Best Practices for Oral History as agreed upon by the Oral History Association (2009) and expects that use of this material will be done with respect for these professional ethics.</p><p>2. Every oral history relies on the memories, views and opinions of the narrator. Because of the personal nature of oral history, listeners may find some viewpoints or language of the recorded participants to be objectionable. In keeping with its mission of preservation and unfettered access whenever possible, BHS presents these views as recorded.</p><p>3. Transcripts created prior to 2008 serve as a guide to the interview and are not considered verbatim. The audio recording should be considered the primary source for each interview. It may contain natural false starts, verbal stumbles, misspeaks, repetitions that are common in conversation, and other passages and phrases omitted from the transcript. This decision was made because BHS gives primacy to the audible voice and also because some researchers do find useful information in these verbal patterns.</p><p>4. Unless these verbal patterns are germane to your scholarly work, when quoting from this material researchers are encouraged to correct the grammar and make other modifications maintaining the flavor of the narrator's speech while editing the material for the standards of print.</p>  </odd>

His parents moved to Brooklyn Heights around 1956 and still reside on Remsen Street. Avram lives in the neighborhood as well, on Garden Place, with his wife, Lynne Greenberg, and their two children, Benjamin (16) and Lily (12). His parents immigrated to the United States following WWII; his father (81) is from Romania and his mother is from Switzerland. He attended Packer Collegiate Institute from nursery school through 4th grade, then Brooklyn Poly Prep from 5th – 9th grade, and then Saint Ann's until graduating from high school. He graduated from Brown University in 1987, where he and his wife met, and then Duke University School of Law (1991). After practicing law with a Wall Street firm, he took a leave of absence to work on the Clinton 1992 presidential campaign and later made a change of careers joining a news show at ABC. He is currently an executive producer at ABC.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_5b9d84338bc9ac3b4298f08987f11ab4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>During the interview, Eric Avram (1965-) describes his parents' immigration to Brooklyn. He relates how his parents met when his father was in medical school in Geneva. Avram talks about his close family, including his children and their cousins, most of whom live in Brooklyn Heights. He talks about career changes and shares his memories of the Brooklyn Heights Synagogue. He recalls setting up the chairs and someone bringing home-baked challah at Grace Court. He describes that the elders/founders of the synagogue conveyed to the young children a sense of thankfulness that the church was allowing them to worship in the space on Friday nights. Avram recalls that this was only 30 years after WWII and the elders were "suspicious of being accepted or not" and "seemed touched" by the church's generosity. He also describes well the political sense of the synagogue community and their proactive response to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s—1990s and reaching out to the Muslim Community in Brooklyn following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Avram explains that his family is still very close to the synagogue and all family life cycle moments have involved the synagogue (bar/bat mitzvahs, weddings, births) and that it is his family's tradition on Yom Kippur to do the Jonah reading, a tradition they maintain as the family grows.

She lives with her husband and children, Hannah (1987-) and Joshua (1990-) in a brownstone that they share with her parents on Clinton Street. Her father was born in Brooklyn and his parents were from Ukraine/Russia. Her mother was born in Berlin, Germany and left in the summer of 1940, settling with her family in Shanghai, China and Chicago before marrying and moving to Brooklyn in 1954. Wagner Bary attended elementary school at PS8 in the neighborhood, followed by Hunter High School (1974), SUNY Binghamton, Cornell University, and Sarah Lawrence where she earned an MFA in Dance and Choreography (1982). Since 1991 she has taught creative dance at Brooklyn Friends School. She attended religious education classes at Brooklyn Heights Synagogue as a child but was never bat mitzvahed. She joined BHS in 1995 when her children were young and completed her bat mitzvah when she was 40 years old.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_35bf56024396a6573499d73e408d7eb8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>During her interview, Margaret Wagner Bary (1957-) describes her family's immigration history in detail. Bary recalls the synagogue's meeting spaces vividly, first in a church on the southeast corner of Clinton and Remsen [Spencer Memorial Church] which has now been converted into apartments; one of her first memories, at 6 years old, is being asked up to bima because it was her birthday that month and Rabbi Gelber lifted her up. She later remembers the services at the Bossert Hotel with Marion Cohen singing and learning about the 1967 [Six-Day Arab-Israeli] war in religious school as it was happening.  She also remembers services at the Grace [Episcopal] Church on Grace Court alley. She describes how her interest in Jewish culture continued through high school and college. Bray joined an Israeli dance club at Hunter High School, participated in a young Jewish leadership program, and traveled to Israel in 1973 (just prior to the Yom Kippur Arab-Israeli war). She describes her dance education beginning with classes taught at Saint Ann's after school, followed by classes in Manhattan and eventually studying with the New Dance Group Studios (Martha Graham), Alvin Ailey Studios, and extensively with Merce Cunningham. She describes wonderfully her family traditions on high holidays and meeting her husband through Israeli folk dancing. Bray and her husband officially joined BHS when their daughter was 8 years old (1995) because they wanted the children to go to Hebrew school.
