    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Minimally processed to the collection level. In 2011 it was noted that daguerreotypes of Charles Simler, his wife, and his son were donated with these papers, but could not be located. In 2022 three tintype photographs of the family were located. These were assumed to be the images described as daguerreotypes in the accession file and were intellectually linked to this collection. This collection was rehoused and the finding aid revised by Dee Bowers in 2023.</p>  </processinfo>
