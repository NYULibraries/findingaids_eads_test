    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Minimally processed to the collection level. This collection was rehoused and the finding aid revised by Dee Bowers in 2024. At that time, preservation photocopies were created of three of the loose programs, as well as news clippings from the scrapbook, and the originals discarded. The collection was also renamed to reflect documentation in the accession file indicating that the scrapbook was the gift of James Miller.</p>  </processinfo>
