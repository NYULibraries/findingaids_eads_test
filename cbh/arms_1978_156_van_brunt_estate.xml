Abigail was one of the three executors of Van Brunt's will, along with one of their sons, Jeremiah (born 1791), and Van Brunt's brother-in-law, John C. Vanderveer (circa 1763-1845) of Flatbush, who was acting executor. Vanderveer was married to Rutgert A.'s younger sister, Elizabeth (1768-1855). Another sister of Rutgert A. was Altje (1771-1862) who married Englebart Lott of Flatlands in 1788.</p>    <list type="ordered">

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of papers pertaining to the estate of Rutgert A. Van Brunt of New Utrecht, now part of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The collection appears to have been compiled by the acting executor, John C. Vanderveer. The documents include a probated last will and testament (1818), an inventory of the estate (which included enslaved African-Americans), list of articles sold at auction, receipts against the estate, a notice of sale of articles from the estate of both Rutgert A. Van Brunt and Jeremiah Van Brunt listed by the executor, John Vanderveer, sale of farming tools to Vanderveer, and a quit-claim deed from Abigail Van Brunt to John Vanderveer. There is also a land indenture from an earlier period (1788) between Van Brunt, his wife, and Engelbart Lott and his wife with John Van Der Veer.</p>  </scopecontent>
