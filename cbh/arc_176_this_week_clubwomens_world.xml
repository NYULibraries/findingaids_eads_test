<p>Since the early 19th century, New York City has been a major center for the publishing of women's magazines.  Some of the earliest titles included <emph render="italic">Lady's Weekly Miscellany</emph> (1805-1808) and <emph render="italic">Ladies' Literary Cabinet</emph> (1819-1822).  Later prominent titles published and edited in New York included <emph render="italic">Vogue</emph> (1892-), <emph render="italic">The Dilineator</emph> (1873-1937), <emph render="italic">Cosmopolitan</emph> (1886-), <emph render="italic">Good Housekeeping</emph> (1885-), and <emph render="italic">Ladies' Home Journal</emph> (1883-).  While for many decades these publications contained articles relating to such issues as fashion, domestic life, and activities of the social elite, in the 1960s they also began to carry articles reflecting the dramatic changes upheaving women's conventional social roles.  From the 1970s onward, women's magazines continued to flourish in New York City and covered an increasingly diverse range of issues.</p><p><emph render="italic">This Week</emph>, later titled <emph render="italic">The Clubwomen's World</emph>, was a weekly women's magazine published in Brooklyn during the late 1920s and 1930s.  Initially containing only social news relating to Brooklyn Heights, the magazine later expanded its coverage to include social news relating to additional Brooklyn neighborhoods, the activities of Brooklyn women's clubs, and the greater New York City area.  The magazine was edited by Lee M. Pasquin and published by Gertrude Morrison Fisher.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
