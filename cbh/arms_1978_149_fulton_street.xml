    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>In the decades following the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883, Fulton Street in Downtown Brooklyn became a commercial center. This activity declined somewhat in the 1950s and 1960s, but in 1977, the Fulton Mall retail area was established and became home to over 100 retail stores.</p><p>Ohrbach's was a firm of clothing retailers founded in 1923 in Union Square, Manhattan by Nathan M. Ohrbach, an immigrant from Austria. After moving to 34th Street near Herald Square, the company's sales exceeded $30 million. It ceased operations in 1987.</p>    <list type="ordered">
