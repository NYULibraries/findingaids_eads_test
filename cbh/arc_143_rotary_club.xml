The club's various committees, such as cultural, welfare, community safety, and community service, contributed to the organization's overall goal of improving the surrounding community through service and providing a productive social group for local businessmen and professionals. After a drop in membership in the 1970s, the Brooklyn club rebuilt itself in the late 1990s and continues serving the residents of the borough as of 2010.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
