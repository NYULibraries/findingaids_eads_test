<p>This small collection is housed in a single folder. The materials were seemingly originally part of a single volume, but at the time of reprocessing the archivist found several loose sheets along with the volume, as well as folded pages that were deteriorating along their creases. The pages are in order of the original volume as much as possible.</p>  </arrangement>
  <bioghist id="aspace_c3dcdfdbf63534f84d141f0d871940bd">
    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The year 1889 marked the centennial of the inauguration of George Washington as President of the United States. On February 3, 1889, the Committee on the Centennial Celebration appointed a sub-committee entitled the Committee on Entertainment with Stuyvesant Fish as Chairman. The event took place on April 29 and 30, 1889 at the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>  </bioghist>
