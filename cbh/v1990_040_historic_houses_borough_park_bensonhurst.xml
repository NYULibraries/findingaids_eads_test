      <p>The Photographs of historic houses in Borough Park and Bensonhurst is comprised of six modern black-and-white photographic prints showing historic houses that were located in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Borough Park and Bensonhurst, circa 1890 to 1900. Three photographs show houses or locations that relate to the Cowenhoven family of Brooklyn including one interior view of the Garret Peter Cowenhoven Farmhouse (at 18th Avenue) showing Isabel Beck Cowenhoven and a nurse holding Peter Cowenhoven as a baby, circa 1900. Also included is one photograph showing an exterior view of the Van Brunt House that was located in the town of New Utrecht (now present-day Bensonhurst); an exterior view of an unidentified Dutch Colonial style house that was also located in New Utrecht; and one photograph showing a horse and carriage travelling on Cowenhoven Lane (now 54th Street) with the Sands House and St. Jude Parish House in the distance.</p>
