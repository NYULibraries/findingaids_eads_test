    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Since the early 19th century, New York City has been a major center for the publishing of women's magazines.  Some of the earliest titles included <emph render="italic">Lady's Weekly Miscellany</emph> (1805-1808) and <emph render="italic">Ladies' Literary Cabinet</emph> (1819-1822).  Later prominent titles published and edited in New York included <emph render="italic">Vogue</emph> (1892-), <emph render="italic">The Dilineator</emph> (1873-1937), <emph render="italic">Cosmopolitan</emph> (1886-), <emph render="italic">Good Housekeeping</emph> (1885-), and <emph render="italic">Ladies' Home Journal</emph> (1883-).  While for many decades these publications contained articles relating to such issues as fashion, domestic life, and activities of the social elite, in the 1960s they also began to carry articles reflecting the dramatic changes upheaving women's conventional social roles.  From the 1970s onward, women's magazines continued to flourish in New York City and covered an increasingly diverse range of issues.</p><p><emph render="italic">The New York Woman</emph> was a weekly women's magazine published in New York City during the 1930s.  The magazine's focus was on fashion, home furnishings, entertainment, and special articles reflecting women's interests.  The magazine's editor was James Monahan.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
