<p>Lawrence "Larry" Mascola (1915-1962) lived in Brooklyn as a young man and was a veteran of World War II, in which he served as a Technical Sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve.  An avid baseball fan, Mr. Mascola was involved in the early 1950s in the Little League of Islip, New York.  He was also one of a number of community leaders who helped in the development of the "Long Island Nights" program of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the early 1950s.  As the organizer of the Islip night out at Ebbets Field, he was part of a group of community leaders invited in 1952 to attend four days of the Brooklyn Dodgers' spring training camp at "Dodgertown" in Vero Beach, Florida, where attendees had the opportunity to observe practice and mingle with players and executives.</p><p>Lawrence "Larry" Mascola (1915-1962) lived in Brooklyn as a young man and was a veteran of World War II, in which he served as a Technical Sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve.
