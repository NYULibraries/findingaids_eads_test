<p>Due to space constraints and scope, CBH decided to receive and accession from the donor only those materials most related to Brooklyn and the family members who lived there. </p><p>Castanets that Harold Buehl brought back from Spain after World War II and a November 26, 1972 issue of <emph>LI: Newsday's Magazine for Long Island</emph> were determined to be out of scope and discarded with the donor's permission.</p>  </appraisal>
