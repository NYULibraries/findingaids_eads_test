    <abstract id="aspace_875291c7bc5a14aeda0eea69bcc15269">John C. Bergen (1826-1907) was a farmer on Bergen's Island in Flatlands, Kings County, New York (now part of Brooklyn). His papers include pages from his diary (1846-1848, 1854); an account book with daybook and other transactional entries (1827-1835, 1865-1894); and Bergen's 1866 federal tax return. The diary entries focus principally on daily farming activities, hunting (including at Barren Island), weather, and bringing goods to market in Brooklyn and other Kings County towns, with references to illnesses, participation in town meetings, Bible readings, and other aspects of daily rural life. A farmhand named John J. who appears frequently in the diary's 1840s entries is, judging from an 1854 entry, an African-American.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>John C. Bergen (1826-1907) lived on the family farm on Bergen's Island in Flatlands, Kings County, New York, until 1890. He was the son of Cornelius Bergen (1798-1865).  (See page 357 of Teunis G. Bergen's <emph render="italic">The Bergen Family</emph> in the BHS library at call number CS71.B47.1876. Also see the obituary from the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph> of June 8, 1907, a copy of which is also found at page 357 in the above book.)</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes pages from a diary (1846-1848, 1854) maintained by Flatlands farmer John C. Bergen; an account book with daybook entries (1827-1835), records of various transactions, such as sales of farm produce and purchase of manure and other supplies (1865-1872), and notes on cow births (1882-1894); one loose page of an account book (1872-1874); and Bergen's 1866 federal tax return. The diary entries focus principally on daily farming activities, hunting (including at Barren Island), weather, and bringing goods to market in Brooklyn and other Kings County towns, with references to illnesses, participation in town meetings, and other aspects of daily rural life. A farmhand named John J. who appears frequently in the diary's 1840s entries is, judging from an 1854 entry, an African-American. The 1854 pages include lists of daily family and "secret" Bible readings.</p>  </scopecontent>
