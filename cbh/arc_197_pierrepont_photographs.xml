    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>John Jay Pierrepont (1849-1923) was the youngest son of Henry Evelyn and Anna Maria (nee Jay) Pierrepont, a prominent Brooklyn family. Born on September 2, 1849 in Rye, N.Y., John Jay Pierrepont was a Brooklyn businessman and financier who, with his elder brother Henry Evelyn Pierrepont II, took over the family business, the Pierrepont Stores, following their father's retirement. Outside of his professional activities, John Jay was involved in numerous Brooklyn and New York City organizations and clubs. He served as treasurer at the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) and was one of the original board members for the Committee on Brooklyn History (which was supervised by the Long Island Historical Society). Further, he was a member of the Brooklyn Institute, the New York Zoological Association, the Audubon Society, the Hamilton Club, the New York Yacht Club, and the Down Town Association, among others. </p><p>John Jay Pierrepont was also an amateur photographer and he photographed many Brooklyn subjects including historic Brooklyn houses and maritime activities on New York Harbor (or Upper New York Bay) and the East River. Pierrepont married Elise de Rahm on October 26, 1876 and they had one son who died in infancy. Elise died several years later, in 1879, and Pierrepont never remarried. He lived at 1 Pierrepont Place in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">

The majority of items in this series were created by John Jay Pierrepont. The series also includes several items created by New York City-based lantern slide manufacturers: T.H. McAllister and Walter Isaacs. The subject for the majority of slides consists of maritime activities along the East River where it spills into New York Harbor (or Upper New York Bay). The vantage point from which most of the slides are taken is from the Brooklyn Heights shoreline, just above the docks and warehouses, looking across the harbor towards the lower Manhattan skyline. At times the view focuses southward, capturing the Statue of Liberty, while at other times the view turns northward, capturing the Brooklyn Bridge. The slides document the harbor during the 1870s and 1880s when the harbor was a very active maritime route for the importing and exporting of goods to and from New York City, as well as later, from the 1890s through the 1910s, when maritime activity slowed. Various kinds of boats are captured in the slides including ferries, tugboats, barks (barques; barcs), and sloops. The slides also show the Brooklyn Bridge during construction and post-construction, the Statue of Liberty, day-time and nighttime views of the lower Manhattan skyline, the Pierrepont Stores after the fire in 1881, and dock scenes in Brooklyn, among others. Finally, there are several non-maritime related subjects in the collection including street scenes in Brooklyn Heights and views of Prospect Park.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref13_wxy" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 2: Photograph album</unittitle><unitid>V1986.065</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">0.17 Linear Feet</extent><extent altrender="carrier">one photograph album contained in one manuscript box.</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1913/1923" type="inclusive">1913-1923</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fe1290913e3bb0cd80383f36a31ca079"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The photograph album contains black-and-white photographic prints that primarily document 17th and 18th century houses and homesteads in Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island.
