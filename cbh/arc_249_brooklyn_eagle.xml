    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Several supplements from 1946 Sunday issues of the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper containing profiles of the borough of Brooklyn's six original towns, including Brooklyn, Bushwick, Flatbush, Flatlands, Gravesend, and New Utrecht. Profiles detail each town's history, churches, homes, schools, and other notable buildings and monuments. Williamsburg and Greenpoint are included in the Bushwick section, and Bay Ridge is included in the New Utrecht section. The collection also includes a set of booklets made from the supplements, presumably published circa 1947. Several pages of color comics, found interleaved with the Bushwick section, are also included.</p>  </scopecontent>
