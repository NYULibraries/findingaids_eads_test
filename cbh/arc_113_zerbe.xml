    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Warren Kenneth Zerbe was born on August 6, 1923 to Louis and Eleanor Zerbe. The Zerbes first lived in Islip, New York, located in Suffolk County on Long Island. The family then moved to Floral Park, New York in Nassau County, also on Long Island, where Warren Zerbe completed most of his education. The family home was located at 9525 239th Street in Floral Park. He attended Islip School, Floral Park Bellerose School, and Sewanhaka High School from which he graduated in 1941. Zerbe served as seaman first class in the United States Coast Guard during World War II and participated in the invasion of the Philippines aboard a Coast Guard-manned frigate. The contribution of the Coast Guard in screening, fire support, and escort duties during World War II helped to make it possible for U.S. vessels carrying supplies and troops to reach land during the offenses in the Philippines. Zerbe died in 1988.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
