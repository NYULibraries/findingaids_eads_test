    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Feast of the Giglio (sometimes referred to as the Feast of St. Paulinus or San Paolino) is an annual Catholic celebration held by Italian Americans in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx. In 1903, the first annual Feast of the Giglio was celebrated in the streets of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. On feast day, or Giglio Sunday (held in July), celebrants proceed through the streets following a 65 foot high Giglio tower. The immigrants who celebrated the first annual Feast of the Giglio predominantly came from the city of Nola, located in the Campania region of southern Italy, where the feast originates. As of 2011, the feast is still held at the same location in Williamsburg, centered near Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church.</p>  </bioghist>
