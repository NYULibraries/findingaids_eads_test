    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>William W. Burton (d. 1882) was born in England and became a U.S. citizen in 1861. The same year, he married Virginia Baptista, a Portugese immigrant. William Burton was a house painter based in Manhattan. The Burton family lived at 436 Lafayette Avenue in what is now the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The couple had five children: Percival, Virginia E., Minnie, Charles, and Sidney. Percival Burton (b. 1879) married Josie E. Newcombe, and the couple had one son, Robert Burton.</p><p>Virginia Baptista was born in Madeira, Portugal, and was separated from her family as they emigrated from Portugal to Trinidad. According to correspondence, she was stolen by a childless couple who eventually settled in New York. Twenty-five years later, Baptista was able to locate her family in Madeira, but lost permanent contact with her mother. Her father died two months after his family left Portugal. </p>  </bioghist>
