      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Hopewell Society of Brooklyn was incorporated in 1870 as the Society for the Aid of Friendless Women and Children.  Its building was located at 20 Concord Street between Fulton and Washington Streets.  The Society administered aid to destitute women and children, providing temporary housing, employment assistance, and educational and recreational programs.  The Society's name was legally changed to the Hopewell Society of Brooklyn in 1921, and a year later the Society moved into a larger building, known as Hopewell House, at 218 Gates Avenue.  In 1928 another building on Monroe Street was donated to the Society and was converted into a home and educational center for adolescent girls.  The Society discontinued its programs for women in 1942, though it later began providing housing for elderly women at another property on Monroe Street.</p>
