    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Cresco Club was founded in March 1899 by women living in the Dyker Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. The club's purpose, as stated in its bylaws, was to offer members the a forum to "improve in culture, to keep in touch with events of the day, to be helpful to each other and to society." Cresco Club held biweekly meetings at members' homes, during which members presented papers and lectures on cultural topics, such as literature, music, and art. These lectures gradually included political, scientific, and social topics in the mid to late 20th century. Though the club remained active into the 1960s and 1970s, it faced difficulty in recruiting younger members and those with careers. Cresco Club appears to have disbanded in the early 1980s.</p><p>Cresco Club was founded in March 1899 by women living in the Dyker Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.
