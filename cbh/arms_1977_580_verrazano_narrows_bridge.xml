<p>The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Staten Island. The bridge is named for the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, the first known European explorer to enter New York Harbor and the Hudson River, and for the body of water it spans, called the Narrows. Construction on the bridge began in the summer of 1959 and the bridge's upper deck was opened in November of 1964. The lower deck of the bridge was completed in 1969. The construction of the bridge was the last major project overseen by New York State Parks Commissioner and Head of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, Robert Moses. The name of the bridge was initially misspelled with only one Z. This mistake was officially corrected in 2018.</p>  </bioghist>
