    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The European settlement of the Town of East Hampton in Long Island was undertaken in 1648 by a group of English Puritan families who had initially migrated from England to the colonies of Connecticut and Massachusetts.  The settlers purchased the town land, comprising 31,000 acres, from the Connecticut and Massachusetts governors, who had previously purchased the land from the native Montaukett Tribe.  In 1664, East Hampton became part of the province of New York, later to become New York State.  As of the 2000 United States Census, the population of East Hampton was 19,719.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
