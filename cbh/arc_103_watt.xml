    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>James Watt (1821-1870) and his wife Barbara Machray Watt (1822-1902) were natives of Aberdeen, Scotland. In 1848, James immigrated to America; Barbara and sons James (b. 1844), William (b. 1846), and Peter (b. 1849) sailed on a later ship and arrived in New York in September of 1849. The Watts first lived in Astoria, Queens, where their fourth son, George (b. 1851), was born. The family moved to Poughkeepsie, N.Y. around 1853, where twins Thomas (1854-1855) and Joseph (1854-1855), son Robert (b. 1856), and daughter Ann (b. 1858) were born. The Watts finally settled in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, where son Thomas was born in 1861.</p>  </bioghist>
