    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>This item was created by the American Silk Label Manufacturing Company of New York. Commemorative versions of this item dating from 1925 and 1975 are housed in the Smithsonian and Metropolitan museums, each including phrases "Presented as a Souvenir of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the American Silk Label Manufacturing co." (1925 edition) and "This historical reproduction was first woven by us in 1876 for the centennial expedition at Philadelphia and was given an award for outstanding workmanship. the original was hung in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. We are proud to weave it again in commemoration of our 100th anniversary and on the coming of the Bicentennial of the United States of America" (1975 edition). This item appears to pre-date the later editions and does not include references to an earlier version, suggesting it was made closer to or right around the time of the Centennial Exposition.</p>    <list type="ordered">

<p>Embroidered silk facsimile of the signatures of all signers of the Declaration of Independence, created circa 1876. An inscription states that signatures were "taken from Irvings History of the U.S. which John Quincy Adams certified were exact imitations of the original." Included are the signatures of the four signers from New York State, including William Floyd and Francis Lewis of Long Island, Philip Livingston of Brooklyn, and Lewis Morris of Westchester. Also included is Charles Carroll, whose Maryland regiment defended Brooklyn during the Battle of Brooklyn in the Revolutionary War, and for whom the Brooklyn neighborhood of Carroll Gardens is named.</p>  </scopecontent>
