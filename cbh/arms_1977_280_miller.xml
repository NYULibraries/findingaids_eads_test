    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Elizabeth Jane Miller (1871-1965) was the daughter of Dr. Francis Frost Miller and Susette Henes, and was born and raised on Highland Avenue in the Brooklyn neighborhood of East New York.  In the early 1890s, she attended school in Germany.  In 1894, she married Charles E. Miller at Trinity Episcopal Church in East New York. Charles's father, John L. Miller, was prominent real estate developer in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and Elizabeth relocated to that area after her marriage. She had two children, Vera Louise Miller Keppler and John Lester Miller (a gold medalist rower at the 1924 Olympic games).</p><p>An extensive genealogy of the family is held in the accession file for the portrait of Sophia Theresia Miller (M1974.35). Researchers interested in this file should consult library staff for more information.</p>  </bioghist>
