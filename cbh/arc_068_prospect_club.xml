<p>Formed in 1897, the Prospect Club was a social organization for women--primarily well-to-do, married women--in Brooklyn. According to a <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph> announcement for the club's first meeting, its mission was the "intellectual and social development of its members by the presentation and discussion of topics of universal interest." These subjects ranged from historical and cultural perspectives on foreign cities to advice for running a modern household and concerns on urban living.</p><p>In addition to regular study meetings, the club also made monetary donations to social causes relevant to women, such as scholarship funds for college-aged women and advocacy groups for the placement of women in employment positions.</p><p>In 1958, the board of the Prospect Club voted to disband; while members planned to continue holding study meetings, the group ceased collecting dues and closed its bank account.</p><p>Formed in 1897, the Prospect Club was a social organization for women in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y.
