    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Villa Joe's was a family-owned restaurant in Coney Island that was located on West 15th Street. The restaurant was founded, owned, and operated by Giuseppe (later known as Joseph) and Fausta Palescandolo. Giuseppe Palescandolo immigrated to New York from Naples, Italy in September 1907 when he was seventeen years old. He initially lived in Manhattan and ran a restaurant located on 14th Street on the East Side. Around the outbreak of World War I, the Austrian-born owner of the building where his restaurant was located evicted him. In 1915, Giuseppe and Fausta took over Masaniello, an abandoned italian restaurant in Coney Island dating to back to circa 1875, and the Palescandolo family moved from Manhattan to Coney Island. In 1925, the Palescandolo's changed the name of the restaurant to Villa Joe's. As Villa Joe's, the restaurant also included a cafe chantant with an in-house orchestrina, comics, singers (all Neapolitan), and a speakeasy. Eventually, the restaurant was taken over other family members. First as Masaniello and then as Villa Joe's, the restaurant ran continually from 1915 to 1975. The building was later demolished.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
