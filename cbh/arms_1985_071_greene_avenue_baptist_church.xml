    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The Greene Avenue Baptist Church records span the years 1854 to 1950 and consist of seven volumes of church records including one register, three volumes of membership lists, and three volumes of church minutes. Volumes 1 to 3 are located in Box 1, Volumes 5, 6, and 7 are located in Box 2, and Volume 4 is located in an oversize enclosure.</p><p>Volume 1; dated 1854 to 1889, is a membership list that includes the name of members; when and how they were received by the church (experience, baptism, restored, letter); former church of the member (if applicable); dates the member was dismissed, died, erased, or excluded; and remarks. The remarks section lists relevant information about individual members such as their maiden name, what church they moved to, or why they were dropped from the church. Following the membership list the volume also records church statistics, contributions, conventions and associations (including names of attendees, dates, and name and place of convention or meeting), officers, trustees, and committees.</p><p>Volume 2; is a church register and dates from 1887 to 1906. The register includes the following sections: official register of deacons; official register of trustees; alphabetical register of members; chronological register of members; and church statistics. The membership register records personal information for each member listed, similar to the information provided in Volume 1.</p><p>Volume 3; contains church minutes dating from 1897 to 1922. The minutes record regular quarterly meetings, committee meetings, baptisms, drop lists, election of deacons, church expenses, letters of dismissal received from other churches, letters of acceptance and resignation from pastors, and resolutions regarding changes to the church building. Loose and attached letters, news clippings, and note cards are interspersed throughout the volume. </p><p>Volume 4; is an oversize membership list that consists of alphabetical member listings. Information recorded for each member includes name, home address, date the member was received, how the member was received (by baptism, letter, experience), and why the member was discontinued (death, left for another church, etc.). Death dates and maiden names of members are often noted. Glued onto the inner front cover is a photographic portrait print of Dr. Curtis Lee Laws, pastor of the church from 1908 to 1913.</p><p>Volumes 5 and 6; dated June 1912 and July 1915, are church rolls listing names and addresses of members. The roll books are organized alphabetically by surname. Marginal notes list information such as dates of baptism and death.</p><p>Volume 7; dated June 1945 to January 1950, is a minute book recording church meetings, baptisms, and resolutions. </p>  </scopecontent>
