    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The U.S.S. Adirondack was a screw sloop launched on February 22, 1862 at the New York Naval Shipyard (more commonly known as the Brooklyn Navy Yard) and commissioned later in the year under the command of G. Gansevoort.  The Adirondack joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron as part of the Union cause in the American Civil War in July 1862.  During July and August the ship cruised near the Bahamas in search of Confederate vessels.  On August 22, 1862, the Adirondack ran aground on Little Bahama Bank, Abaco, Man of War Cay, Bahama Islands.  Her crew was rescued but all salvage attempts failed to rescue the ship.</p>  </bioghist>
