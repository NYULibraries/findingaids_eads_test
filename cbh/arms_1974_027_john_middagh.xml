    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>John Middagh, hatter and merchant of Brooklyn, was active in the fur trade. His house was located at the corner of Fulton and Henry streets, and may be seen in the paintings of Brooklyn Village made by Francis Guy, ca. 1820, as the property of his widow, Sarah Middagh. According to Henry R. Stiles' <emph render="italic">A History of the City of Brooklyn</emph> (1867), Sarah Middagh died in 1837 at the age of 92. Middagh's shop faced Fulton Street, and his barn, located at the corner of Henry Street and Poplar, was adopted as a meeting house for Brooklyn's small Episcopalian congregation in 1784.</p>  </bioghist>
