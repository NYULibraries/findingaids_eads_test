      <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Alexander Hamilton was born in either 1755 or 1757 in the British West Indies. Among his many notable accomplishments, Hamilton was the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, Aide-de-camp to General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War, a signatory of the United States Consitution, an elected member of the Continental Congress and New York Legislature, and the author of 51 of the articles that comprised the <emph render="italic">Federalist Papers</emph>.</p>
      <p>In 1804, Hamilton was shot and killed while fighting in a duel with Vice President Aaron Burr, with whom he had held an ongoing rivalry. Burr challenged Hamilton to the duel after a letter by Charles D. Cooper was published in the Albany Register in which Hamilton was described as having expressed negative feelings about Burr at a high profile dinner party.  Burr, feeling insulted by Hamilton's alleged remarks, challenged him to the duel in which he fatally wounded him with a single shot.</p>
