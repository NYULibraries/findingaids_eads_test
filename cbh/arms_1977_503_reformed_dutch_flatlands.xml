      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Flatlands Dutch Reformed Church was formed in 1654 in the Dutch town of New Amersfoort, one of the six original towns comprising the present-day borough of Brooklyn, and now known as the neighborhood of Flatlands.  The Church's first building was erected at a site near the present-day intersection of Kings Highway and East 40th Street, and stood until 1794.  As of 2011, the current Church building is the third one to occupy the original site.  The building, constructed in 1848, was designated a New York City landmark in 1973.</p>
