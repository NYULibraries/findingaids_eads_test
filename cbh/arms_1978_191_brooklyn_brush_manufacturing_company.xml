    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>On July 29, 1853, a notice appeared in the Frederick Douglass Paper: Freeman Murrow, who lived at 90 Meserole Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, had invented an adjustable paint brush. Murrow had secured a patent, but because of racial prejudice, he was unable to present his invention to the American Institute Fair and had to have it presented by a white man. The adjustable brush won a silver medal at the Fair in October 1853.</p><p>After getting his patent, Murrow formed the Brooklyn Brush Manufacturing Company. The company declared that it stood for "welfare of Civil Rights and not bloodshed" and intended to liberate their wives, sisters, and daughters from taking low-paying jobs as washerwomen and domestic servants.</p><p>On June 28, 1855, at the Convention of Radical Political Abolitionists, Lewis Tappan, a prominent abolitionist and Brooklyn Heights resident, spoke highly of the brush company, saying that "their project was a very worthy one" and that the purpose of the business was to "gain an honest livelihood for themselves and to elevate their race."</p>    <list type="ordered">
