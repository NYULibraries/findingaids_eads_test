<p>The Donald P. Fina papers span the period 1917 to 1950, though the bulk of the materials date from the period 1917 to 1919.  Materials include official documentation pertaining to Fina's military service in the United States Army during World War I, as well as private correspondence between Fina and family members and friends while he was stationed overseas.  Post-war material includes documentation regarding Fina's role in veteran affairs, particularly his involvement with the Survivors of Company L; his contribution to Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidential campaign as president of the Roosevelt League; his contribution to state and local politics in Wisconsin; his work as a songwriter, including sheet music and lyrics; and further private correspondence.  There are also six photographs, one of which, dating from February 1933, is of former New York governor Al Smith and seems to have been signed and made out to Fina by Smith himself.  There are also two undated and signed copy photographs of Hollywood actors Jane Russell and Don Ameche, a portrait of Margaret Fina (circa 1919), a portrait of Joseph Lamb Jr. (1917), and an undated photograph of Fina himself.  Finally, the collection also includes two scrapbooks documenting the activities of the 106th Regiment of Brooklyn, the events of World War I, life in Brooklyn and New York City, politics and culture, the activities of the Roosevelt League of America, and other matters.  One of the scrapbooks is oversized and is housed separately from the rest of the collection.</p>  </scopecontent>
