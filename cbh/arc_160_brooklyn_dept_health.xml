<p>The amended charter of the City of Brooklyn, written in 1873, mandated the formation of a department of health. The head of this department was called the Health Commissioner. The Health Commissioner's duties included the removal and burial of the dead, operation and maintenance of ambulance services, the registration of births, marriages and deaths, the registration and maintenance of vital statistics, and the regulation of sanitary standards in city buildings. In times of emergency, such as the outbreak of a dangerous disease in the city, extrordianry powers could be conferred upon the Health Commissioner to address the crisis.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
