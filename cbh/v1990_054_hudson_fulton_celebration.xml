    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Hudson-Fulton Celebration was a two week event held in September and October of 1909 commemorating both the 300th anniversary of Henry Hudson's "discovery" of the Hudson River and the 100th anniversary of Robert Fulton's first successful run of his steamboat service between New York City and Albany, N.Y. Events held during the celebration included parades, fireworks, concerts, exhibitions, and the illumination of the exteriors of various buildings, bridges, and monuments throughout New York City with electric lights. Events took place throughout New York City, as well as in several cities located along the Hudson River.</p>  </bioghist>
