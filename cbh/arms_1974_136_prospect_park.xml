    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The New York City Department of Parks was formed in 1934 when Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia discontinued the independent parks departments of the city's five boroughs and consolidated them to form a unifying administrative body to govern the entirety of the city's park system. LaGuardia appointed Robert Moses as the Parks Department's first commissioner. After becoming a branch of the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Administration under Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1968, the Parks Department was reorganized as the Department of Parks &amp; Recreation under Mayor Abraham D. Beame in 1976.</p><p>Prospect Park, located in Brooklyn, N.Y. was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the landscape architects responsible for Central Park and Riverside Park in Manhattan. Construction began in 1866 and continued into the 1870s. The park's design included a meadow, wooded ravine, and lake. Prospect Park was immensely popular upon opening, and attracted visitors from across the social classes. The park's rural scenery and recreation areas were supplemented by new features such as a zoo and playgrounds in the early 20th century. Prospect Park is one of the largest parks in Brooklyn and receives millions of visitors each year.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
