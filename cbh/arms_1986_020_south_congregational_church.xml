    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The South Congregational Church was established in May of 1851 in what is now the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn. Between 1851 and 1899, the church had installed six pastors, several of whom had become very influential within the Congregational denomination, including Rev. Rufus Wheelwright Clark, Rev. Henry M. Storrs, and Rev. Albert J. Lyman. Rev. Richard Salter Storrs provided the address at Lyman's 25th anniversary celebration in 1899.</p><p>The church building, located at Court and President Streets, was built in several stages between the years 1857 to 1893. In 1857 the Romanesque Revival chapel was built, followed by a ladies' parlor in 1889, and the neo-Gothic rectory in 1893. As of 2010, the church and rectory had been converted into condominiums and the congregation of South Congregational Church merged with Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims located in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
