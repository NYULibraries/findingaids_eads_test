<p>Peter Stuyvesant (1610-1672), a major figure in the early history of New York City, was the last Director-General of the Dutch colonial province of New Netherland (later New York). He was appointed by the Dutch West India Company in 1646 and served until 1664, when New Netherland was ceded to the English and later renamed New York.</p>  </bioghist>
