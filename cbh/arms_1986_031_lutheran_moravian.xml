    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Lutherans arrived in the New Amsterdam colony among Dutch settlers in 1649. Though the practice of Lutheranism was not explicitly forbidden, hostility from the Dutch Reformed church slowed the establishment and growth of the denomination in the colony. As German immigrants arrived in the 18th century, tensions arose between German and Dutch Lutherans, primarily over the language in which services would be delivered. By 1840, Brooklyn had seven Lutheran chuches. The denomination grew again with an influx of German and Scandinavian immigrants, making Lutherans the second largest Protestant congregation in New York City in 1920.</p><p>Moravians are a Protestant denomination which originated from the Moravian region in what is now the Czech Republic. The first Moravian church in the area of present-day New York City was dedicated in 1763. By the 1990s, New York City had 10 Moravian churches, two of which were located in Brooklyn.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
