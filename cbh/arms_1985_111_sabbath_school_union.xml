    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Sabbath School Union (later known as the Brooklyn Sunday School Union) was formed in 1830 for the purpose of providing young people with Christian religious instruction, which the Union's founders asserted was sorely lacking from public education. Churches of many Protestant denominations were represented in the Union, including Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregational, Lutheren, and Reformed churches.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Sabbath School Union collection measures 0.3 linear feet and spans the dates 1855 to 1974. Included in the collection are annual reports, hymnals, newsletters, and event programs. Highlights include the annual reports, which provide lists of churches that were part of the Union, in addition to documenting a controversy that arose when the Union requested to use public school space for religious education classes during the 1850s. Additionally, the event programs include materials pertaining to Anniversary Day, an annual holiday originally conceived to celebrate the founding of Brooklyn's first sabbath school. Over the years, this holiday went through several name changes, was gradually secularized, and ultimately became Brooklyn-Queens Day, an official holiday for public school students in all five of New York City's boroughs.</p>  </scopecontent>
