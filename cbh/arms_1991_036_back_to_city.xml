    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Back to the City, Inc., commonly referred to simply as Back to the City, was a national organization dedicated to fostering neighborhood restoration and preservation in America's cities.  The organization grew out of the Brownstone Revival Committee of New York (later the Brownstone Revival Coalition), which in 1974 held a national conference on urban restoration and preservation called "Back to the City" at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan.  After this initial formation, Back to the City engaged in a range of urban renewal and community development activities for the next 13 years, including participating in and supporting activism campaigns, holding annual national conferences at cities around the country, and issuing a regular newsletter.  Back to the City's headquarters were located at 12 East 41st Street in Manhattan.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
