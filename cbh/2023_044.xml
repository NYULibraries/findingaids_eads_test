    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Williamsburg(h) is a neighborhood in northwestern Brooklyn (2008 pop. ca 121,000), bounded on the east by the Queens County line, on the south by Flushing Avenue, on the west by the East River, and on the north by North 15th Street, then along McCarren Park's western and southern edges to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway at Bayard Street. During the early 1930s many businesses in the neighborhood declared bankruptcy and many prosperous residents left. The Jewish community continued to grow, and a large number of Jewish refugees escaping Nazism moved in and formed Hasidic synagogues and schools; there were more than 20 sects from different parts of Europe, including the large Satmar sect from Hungary and Romania, led by its rabbi Joel Teitelbaum. Manufacturing, which employed more than a million people in the city in 1950, attracted many Puerto Ricans during the following decade.</p><p>Reference: The Encyclopedia of New York City Second Edition by Kenneth T.
