<p>The oral histories in this collection were processed by Leah Dilworth, Intern, in 2021. Interviews were processed to the item level and catalogued records were created by Amy Lau, Archivist, after processing. Due to privacy concerns, the specific birthdates and home addresses of all narrators or other named individuals were redacted from audio recordings. Interviews were cataloged using Library of Congress subject headings.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>General</head>
<p>Oral history interviews are intimate conversations between two people, both of whom have generously agreed to share these recordings with the Brooklyn Historical Society archives and with researchers. Please listen in the spirit with which these were shared. Researchers will understand that:</p><p>1. The Brooklyn Historical Society abides by the General Principles &amp; Best Practices for Oral History as agreed upon by the Oral History Association (2009) and expects that use of this material will be done with respect for these professional ethics.</p><p>2. Every oral history relies on the memories, views and opinions of the narrator. Because of the personal nature of oral history, listeners may find some viewpoints or language of the recorded participants to be objectionable. In keeping with its mission of preservation and unfettered access whenever possible, BHS presents these views as recorded.</p><p>3. Transcripts created prior to 2008 serve as a guide to the interview and are not considered verbatim. The audio recording should be considered the primary source for each interview. It may contain natural false starts, verbal stumbles, misspeaks, repetitions that are common in conversation, and other passages and phrases omitted from the transcript. This decision was made because BHS gives primacy to the audible voice and also because some researchers do find useful information in these verbal patterns.</p><p>4. Unless these verbal patterns are germane to your scholarly work, when quoting from this material researchers are encouraged to correct the grammar and make other modifications maintaining the flavor of the narrator's speech while editing the material for the standards of print.</p>  </odd>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) was founded in 1863 as the Long Island Historical Society (LIHS). The founders of the Long Island Historical Society were among the city's most prominent citizens, whose families could trace their Brooklyn roots back to the 17th and 18th centuries. They established the Society as a library committed to preserving the history of America, New York State, and most especially, "the counties, towns and villages of Long Island."</p><p>Long Island Historical Society was initally located on Court Street in Brooklyn Heights, but relocated to 128 Pierrepont Street after the Society held a contest and selected renowned architect George Browne Post to design its headquarters. The magnificent landmark building designed by Post opened in 1881.</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the Society reestablished itself as a museum and education center. In 1985, it underwent a name to Brooklyn Historical Society. The Society also established a pioneering oral history program, reaching out to as-yet unchronicled Brooklyn communities and capturing their experiences. The Society also began featuring exhibits such as Black Churches in Brooklyn and AIDS/Brooklyn, the first exhibit to cover this topic at a history museum in the United States.</p><p>In October 1999, BHS undertook a full-scale restoration of its landmark building to create new exhibition space and climate-controlled storage for its valuable collections. In 2014, BHS completed a renovation of the first and lower levels.</p>  </bioghist>
