The collection includes church records, clippings, postcards, and one tintype. A large portion of the collection relates to the business of the Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church, including its account books, invoices, receipts, and correspondence with Brooklyn businesses, such as mechanics, upholsterers, and insurance agents. A pew plan shows the layout of the sanctuary and nave. In addition, pledge cards from 1920 list names--possibly church members--with home addresses.</abstract>

The collection includes church records, clippings, postcards, and one tintype. A large portion of the collection relates to the business of the Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church, including its account books, invoices, receipts, and correspondence with Brooklyn businesses, such as mechanics, upholsterers, and insurance agents.

    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Both the Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church and the Dutch Reformed Church of Flatlands were founded in 1654, making them two of the three oldest congregations in the present-day borough of Brooklyn. The current Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church was built from 1793 to 1798 and the current Dutch Reformed Church of Flatlands was built in 1848. Both churches were landmarked by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1966.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
