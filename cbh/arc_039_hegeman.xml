    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>The Hegeman family was one of the earliest Dutch families to settle in the town of Flatbush (one of the original six towns of Brooklyn). Originating from the city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Adriaen Hegeman (1624-1672), his wife Katrina (nee Margits; 1628-1690), and two sons, Joseph and Hendricus, immigrated to New Amsterdam (now New York City) around 1650. After briefly living on the island of Manhattan, the Hegeman family settled in Flatbush where they bought farmland. In Flatbush, Adriaen and Katrina had seven more children--Jacobus, Abraham, Denyse, Isaac, Benjamin, Elizabeth, and John. </p><p>By the 18th and 19th centuries, segments of the Hegeman family could be found in various areas of Brooklyn, including in the present-day neighborhoods of Midwood, Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Borough Park, and Park Slope. Adrian Hegeman (d. circa 1805), a descendant of Adriaen, was a farmer who lived in the town of New Utrecht (also one of the original six towns of Brooklyn) with his wife Jannitje and two sons, Thomas and Denyse. Thomas Hegeman served in various positions in the town of New Utrecht including as town clerk from 1797 to 1822; as constable in 1811; as deacon of the Dutch Reformed Church, in 1798 and 1804; and as justice of the peace, from 1821 to 1828.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
