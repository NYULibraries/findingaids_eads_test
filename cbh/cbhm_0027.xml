<p>The Veterans Administration Brooklyn Regional Office opened on May 5, 1947, as an office of the New York district. Its offices were originally located at 25 Ryerson Street in Clinton Hill and moved to 250 Livingston St in Downtown Brooklyn on July 7, 1952. On August 28, 1965, the Brooklyn office was consolidated with the New York Regional Office (located in Manhattan). The Brooklyn Regional Office was managed by A.B. Kelly (May 1947–January 1959) and T.A. Hurlbut (February 1959–August 1965).</p><p>The Personnel Information Bulletins were at various times edited by the Personnel Officer and the Assistant to the Personnel Officer. Identified editors include Junius Kurens (as early as December 1955–April 1956), Simon Esterowitz (May 1956–June 1958), Benjamin Ganchrow (July 1958–June 1961), and Felix J. Cuervo (September 1961–April 1964).</p>  </bioghist>
