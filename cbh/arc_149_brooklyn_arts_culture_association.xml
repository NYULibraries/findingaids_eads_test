<p>The Brooklyn Arts and Culture Association ("BACA") was founded in 1966 to promote local cultural programs and organize arts programming in the borough of Brooklyn. BACA partnered with the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences in 1969 and received steady financial support throughout the 1970s. The organization grew into a granting agency in 1980, and became known as the Brooklyn Arts Council in 1987.</p>  </bioghist>
