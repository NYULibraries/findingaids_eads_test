    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The First Baptist Church of Williamsburg was founded in 1839 as Bethel Baptist Church, a small congregation that met at a schoolhouse in the then-village of Williamsburgh, N.Y. The church was renamed First Baptist Church of Williamsburg in 1846, and moved to larger locations along Driggs Avenue. A new chapel was erected in 1885, located at Lee Avenue and Keap Street in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 1910, the church absorbed members of the Central Baptist Church of Williamsburg who had originally split off from First Baptist 50 years earlier. Members of the First Free Baptist Church of Brooklyn also migrated to the church in 1915. The First Baptist Church of Williamsburg closed in 1939, at which time most active members joined Emmanuel Baptist Church in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>  </bioghist>
