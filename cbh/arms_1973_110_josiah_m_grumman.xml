    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Josiah M. Grumman was born in Newark, N.J.  He later moved to Brooklyn and became a civil engineer and surveyor.  When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Grumman volunteered for service in the 84th Regiment of the New York State Volunteer Infantry (commonly known as the 14th Regiment of the New York State Militia, or the "Fighting 14th") and was elected a Sergeant of Company H.  He was taken prisoner during the Battle of Falls Church and sent to the Confederate Libby Prison in Virginia.  After his release, he rejoined the 84th Regiment and was elected First Lieutenant of Company H.  At the second battle of Bull Run in August 1862, Grumman was fatally wounded.  He was buried in Lyons Farms Cemetery in New Jersey.</p>  </bioghist>
