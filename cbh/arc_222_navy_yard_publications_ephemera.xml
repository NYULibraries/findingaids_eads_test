    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The origins of the Brooklyn Navy Yard (officially known as the New York Naval Shipyard) date to 1801, when the United States Navy acquired what had previously been a small, privately owned shipyard in order to construct naval vessels. By the time the Department of Defense ceased shipbuilding activities at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1966, 88 vessels had been manufactured at the facility. In 1967, the Brooklyn Navy Yard was acquired by the City of New York and was converted for private commercial use.</p>  </bioghist>
