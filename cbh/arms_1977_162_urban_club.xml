      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The Urban Club was organized in March 1894 as a women's social club for the purpose of studying "true philanthropy, municipal law, and the science of government." Its regular luncheon meetings were held on the second Tuesday of each month, with occasional evening meetings at which distinguished speakers were invited to give lectures on current events of national and local significance. Throughout its existence, the Urban Club had no central physical headquarters; its meetings were hosted in its members' homes on a voluntary basis (1).</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Urban Club records span the years 1914 to 1956 and measure 0.82 linear feet. The bulk of the collection consists of bound volumes of the Club's meeting minutes. The minutes provide a glimpse of the Urban Club's primary activities and interests, including the speakers it hosted, the philanthropic causes it supported, and the current events that were of concern at different times during its existence. The meeting minutes also include the names of club members and meeting attendees, and document the elections of club officers as well as approval of new members. Also included in the collection are two scrapbooks of newspaper clippings and other ephemera that further document the Club's activities, and some publications of the New York and Long Island Federation of Women's Clubs, of which the Urban Club was a member.  One of the scrapbooks is oversized and is housed separately from the rest of the collection.</p>
