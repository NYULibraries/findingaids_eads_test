    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Council for Social Planning (BCSP), originally called the Brooklyn Social Planning Committee, was founded in 1933, by a group of prominent citizens, social workers, and representatives of civic organizations who saw a need for an organization to coordinate local social services, especially in the face of funding cuts during the Great Depression. BCSP promoted, guided, and evaluated the health and welfare of the people of Brooklyn, and offered leadership to all groups in the community working to improve, extend, and prevent duplication of social services. The Council had two types of members: social and health agencies engaged in meeting the needs of Brooklyn residents; and individuals interested in these causes. Members comprised all religions, ethnic, and racial groups in the borough. BCSP aimed to build a community in which citizens would be fully employed, and have adequate standards of living, housing, recreation and health services, educational opportunity, and social and economic security.</p><p>BCSP sought to accomplish these goals in the following ways: promoting greater effectiveness in attacking social problems by mobilizing groups toward common goals; guiding the development of social services by planning the expansion of current services as well as new services for the future; collecting and maintaining data concerning Brooklyn so that planning would have a sound factual basis; providing information to the public on the facilities available to meet all types of needs; increasing the usefulness of social and health agencies by helping to relate their services to the needs of the community; communicating the needs of Brooklynites to city-wide programs through BCSP's affiliation with the Welfare and Health Council of New York City; developing local neighborhood councils in cooperation with neighborhood organizations; and using research on specific localities to develop services for those areas. BCSP also served to bring social needs to the attention of grant-giving agencies such as The Greater New York Fund. The Council sought to keep the public informed through press releases, bulletins and reports to focus borough-wide attention on social needs and on the desirability of supporting the agencies and institutions which met those needs. Through its active programming, conferences, and professional training for social workers, BCSP kept the social welfare needs of the community in the public eye.</p><p>BCSP was funded primarily by the Welfare and Health Council of New York City, later called the Community Council of Greater New York. When this organization resolved to cut funding to borough councils, including BCSP, as of December 31, 1956, BCSP was unable to find other sources of funding, and was forced to close its doors.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection comprises the records of the BCSP from its founding in 1933 until its demise in 1957, and is organized in ten series, as received from BCSP. Records are much more extensive for the years 1948-57 than for the earlier years of operation. The collection provides a comprehensive description of existing and needed social welfare services in Brooklyn during the years covered, as well as efforts to extend and improve these services in the following areas: child care, adoption and foster care, juvenile delinquency, recreational facilities, neighborhood organization, medical and mental health services, the practice of social work, housing needs, discrimination and segregation issues, veterans services, and volunteerism. In some instances the policies are at odds with current practice (the general approval of public housing projects, for example); in others (the recognition of discrimination in the apportionment of services to certain minority neighborhoods, or school segregation), the records point to a growing cognizance of social injustices which would culminate in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.</p><p>Minutes of meetings present the most comprehensive picture of the administrative and program activities of BCSP during all years of operation, and also include minutes of a related organization, the Brooklyn Health Council. The administrative activities of the organization, including its finances and fund raising, Board of Directors, membership activities, and early history are chronicled in correspondence and related material in Series 2, administrative files. The program files, Series 3, demonstrate the organization's active approach in addressing the needs of all groups, and include committee correspondence, some minutes of meetings, press clippings, and related pamphlets and reports. Programs include annual meetings, family and child welfare activities, group work and recreation, health care services, housing, neighborhood organization, professional training, services to African-Americans, transportation, World War II veterans' services, volunteerism, and youth services.</p><p>The hierarchy of welfare and health councils in New York City during this period is evident in Series 4, which chronicles BCSP's relationship with other related organizations, including its parent organization, the Welfare and Health Council of New York City (later called the Community Council of Greater New York); its sister organizations in the other boroughs; and its distant relatives in other cities. BCSP's offspring, in the form of various Brooklyn neighborhood councils, are documented in Series 5, which also includes general information on many neighborhoods in the borough.</p><p>BCSP's interests and programs included issues involving city, state and local government agencies. Its work with and relationship to various municipal agencies is revealed in correspondence, press clippings, reports and publications in Series 6. Correspondence with and records of cooperative projects with nongovernment organizations and agencies, including Brooklyn College, Brooklyn Public Library, Greater New York Fund, and the Urban League of Greater New York, is found in Series 7, which also includes a large group of files on related nonprofit organizations, mostly in Brooklyn, whose purposes were in sympathy
with those of BCSP.</p><p>Many BCSP projects were anticipated by extensive research and information about particular topics or issues. Publications, pamphlets, press clippings, reports, and other material covering the aged, juvenile delinquency, social welfare legislation, narcotics abuse and Puerto Rican communities in New York, and other issues can be found in Series 8, subject files.</p><p>As the culmination of a project, or as an impetus to social change, BCSP published reports and pamphlets on issues of concern; these are found in series 9. Series 10 contains scrapbooks assembled by BCSP to record the press coverage of its activities and on important issues of the day.</p>  </scopecontent>

Brooklyn Health Council was to bring together health agencies functioning in the community to coordinate and facilitate work, evaluate needs, initiate projects, and act as an information bureau.

Director's correspondence, committee information, certificates of appreciation, finances and fund raising,
founding, legal history, legislative policy, membership, personnel, and public relations.</p><p>The Board of Directors files include general correspondence on issues relating to the administration of BCSP, and nominating committee correspondence regarding the appointment of Board members. There are significant letters to and from Brooklyn borough President John Cashmore, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, and an interesting chronicle of BCSP's involvement with Planned
Parenthood Association. </p><p>Committee files provide an understanding of the range of small committees essential to BCSP's overall mission. Finance files chronicle the budgetary history of the organization, and reveal the financial struggle
BCSP underwent, eventually leading to its demise. The fund raising and finance committee files disclose
important information on the fragile state of BCSP's finances during the "crisis campaign" of 1956-57, when BCSP sought alternative funding after learning that the Community Council of Greater New York, its major funder, would no longer provide financial support. History files describe BCSP's founding and mission, and include preliminary and revised bylaws. The diversity of activities and programs organized by
BCSP are well documented in the press release files. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_b540115047185ebfb011738b55ac4b9e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Activities of BCSP: Reports</unittitle><unitdate

id="aspace_5dc9bbb316f45e66ff9b7635e1d2a1e8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>BCSP was a member of the city-wide Welfare and Health Council of New York; it acted as the Brooklyn borough representative agency. Formed by the merger of the Welfare Council of New York City and the Health Council of New York City in 1952, the organization disbanded itself in February 1956 and formed the Greater New York Community Council, Inc. This was done in an effort to appeal to the Catholic agencies which withdrew from the Welfare and Health Council in 1953 in protest over the admission to the Council of an arm of Planned Parenthood; the Welfare and Health Council experienced financial difficulties after this withdrawal. The Councils' primary functions were the overall planning and coordination of health and welfare services, and providing central services required by the community and the agencies city-wide to produce these services. This subseries includes committee correspondence, reports, minutes of meetings, press clippings, and related material addressing topics such as housing, services to adolescent children, mental health, services to the aged, and population. The department and committee structure of this organization corresponded closely with that of BCSP, and BCSP participated in its committee work. BCSP was dependent on the Welfare and Health Council, and its successor, the Greater New York Community Council, for the bulk of its funding. As of December 31, 1956, the Council stopped funding BCSP and the other borough councils, and they disbanded. (See Series 2, financial files for funding; see subseries 4.2 for other borough councils.)</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_563954a83f3023d5675f3ca2f32ea630" level="file"><did><unittitle>Health Council

To address these needs, BCSP acted as an advisor and a force in the creation of several neighborhood health and welfare councils in Brooklyn, including the Brownsville Health and Welfare Council, Canarsie Health Council, East New York Health Council, and the Fort Greene-Farragut Coordinating Committee (The files for Fort Greene were left in subseries 3.3, Programs: Group Work and Recreation, where they were found). BCSP also served as a consultant to Bedford-Stuyvesant Neighborhood Council, and the Eastern Parkway-Crown Heights Intergroup Council. These neighborhood councils were instrumental in setting up local day care centers, recreation centers, senior centers, and nursery schools. These files, which contain correspondence, reports, committee records, minutes, bylaws, surveys, pamphlets, and related material, document BCSP's participation in bringing health and welfare services to communities on a neighborhood level. Services in more than thirty Brooklyn neighborhoods are covered.</p><p>Files for the councils directly affiliated with BCSP (Brownsville, Canarsie, East New York) are substantial, and include documentation on efforts to establish programs such as blood banks; classes on diabetes, nutrition, obesity, home nursing, and other topics; protection and establishment of neighborhood services including fire protection, sewers, and clean-ups; and local health and mental health clinics. The group on Bedford-Stuyvesant documents the Bedford-Stuyvesant Area Project on Juvenile Delinquency, the work of the Citizens Committee for a Municipal Hospital, the Maria Lawton Center for Older People, and the Bedford-Stuyvesant Community Center.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_f0c61904ac099f6d553d6a13c27a618c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bay Ridge: Bay Ridge Community Council

It was a member of the Welfare and Health Council of New York City and a participant in (i.e., funded by) the Greater New York Fund. The Urban League's stated mission was to win equal opportunity for all Americans in employment, housing (it opposed slum clearance and housing projects), education, and health and welfare services. Its programs were historically centered on African-Americans; during the period covered here, it began to expand its programs to include Puerto Ricans as well. The material in this subseries includes correspondence and related material regarding BCSP's participation in Urban League programs including the Urban League's Group Work Advisory Committee (1947-49), and the Brooklyn Coordinating Committee on Fair Housing (1956-57), which advocated the New York State Metcalf-Baker bills and housing desegregation. Also included are press clippings, and Urban League publications and newsletters.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_92b9e0013b75c2b689b0ab75ac7ba7d1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advisory Committee on Group work:  Correspondence, reports, related material</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1947/1949" type="inclusive">1947-1949</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_12f39968538dc7796dfc054d709b8f78" label="Mixed Materials [34444506278829]" type="Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_12f39968538dc7796dfc054d709b8f78" type="Folder">7.4.001</container></did></c><c id="aspace_27130d2da3798b14860b57896eb0b132" level="file"><did><unittitle>Brooklyn Coordinating Committee for Fair  Housing: Correspondence and related material</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1956/1957" type="inclusive">1956-1957</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_512fc6ec8bd430ff53e6a5c182bd70d6" label="Mixed Materials [34444506278829]" type="Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_512fc6ec8bd430ff53e6a5c182bd70d6" type="Folder">7.4.002</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ffa2867288ea7b0738219bed9842651a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence, reports, misc, AYZ</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1946/1957" type="inclusive">1946-1957</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_6458d0aafb6f298068bc8ea17af2ec2a" label="Mixed Materials [34444506278829]" type="Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_6458d0aafb6f298068bc8ea17af2ec2a" type="Folder">7.4.003</container></did></c><c id="aspace_29b050135590bfc8deae34582d29c21b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Press clippings</unittitle><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_3948ea5a4b1cbd6c9b814d6668630fab" label="Mixed Materials [34444506278829]" type="Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_3948ea5a4b1cbd6c9b814d6668630fab" type="Folder">7.4.004</container></did></c><c id="aspace_c4632cf050bfadfbaf5634adb884aba3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Publications, newsletters</unittitle><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_b0147effdf8edb585d58fd90902e1f4b" label="Mixed Materials [34444506278829]" type="Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_b0147effdf8edb585d58fd90902e1f4b" type="Folder">7.4.005</container></did></c><c id="aspace_99a09dc582a0651b8953aeee45ada9f3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Report, "Aspects of Negro Life"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1947/1947">1947</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_5b2e6606fbdb604fa0a453de9d015150" label="Mixed Materials [34444506278829]" type="Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_5b2e6606fbdb604fa0a453de9d015150" type="Folder">7.4.006</container></did></c><c id="aspace_2825ceda72b82bd09ec21759f265baf6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Subcommittee on Personal Service:  Correspondence, reports, and related material</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1946/1947" type="inclusive">1946-1947</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_3ab9bd3e0eb99d4d0345b09f77927e6e" label="Mixed Materials [34444506278829]" type="Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_3ab9bd3e0eb99d4d0345b09f77927e6e" type="Folder">7.4.007</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_c0d52b2503205878e7fd9f86cd3bd239" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 7.5: Other related agencies</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1948/1957" type="inclusive">circa 1948-1957 [includes undated material]</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_c5328a61356819bdb67403e786e8edff"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Alphabetical by organization name.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_627b144fecc190d6c16fb83581ec1133"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Subseries 7.5 is comprised of files on over 250 wide ranging voluntary agencies, schools and school groups, civic associations, religious social service agencies, business and professional organizations, local chapters of national social welfare organizations, and YM/YWCAs and YM/YWHAs.

Contents</head><p>Complementing the subject matter covered in the Program files (see Series 3), and overlapping somewhat with publications included in Series 6 and 7, this series is comprised of subject files on topics relating to the activities of BCSP. These files appear to have been used as reference materials by BCSP staff in planning their programs. Topics covered include: adoption, the aged, child care, child welfare, civil defense, court reform, day care, education, fluoridation of drinking water, health care, juvenile delinquency, summer camp, chronic illness, city planning, housing and health issues, housing discrimination, social welfare legislation,
narcotics abuse (an extensive clipping file), Puerto Rican communities in New York City, and youth (including a large file of press clippings on gangs). Also included are files on Brooklyn history, and the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, as well as U.S. Census Bureau surveys and files of statistics on various social welfare topics.</p><p>These files vary in size and comprehensiveness, and generally include press clippings, publications of various government and nonprofit organizations, articles from professional journals, directories, limited correspondence, and the occasional bibliography.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_314d472b9d54a0f37db95a31e1369a9e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Accidents</unittitle><container altrender="Full

Contents</head><p>Included in this series are various annual reports, pamphlets, and directories produced by the Brooklyn Council for Social Planning. Publications cover topics and services of interest to BCSP, including services to the aged, veterans' services, recreation directories, mental health services, and a guide to using the court system. "Welcome to Brooklyn: Handbook for New Workers," (1954, revised 1955) is a comprehensive reference guide for social service workers who are not familiar with the borough (see also, subseries 3.7, Programs: Professional training). It offers a capsule history of Brooklyn, and its political, industrial, educational and cultural resources, as well as a guide to social welfare services. In 1957 this publication was revised as "All About Brooklyn: A Handbook for Brooklynites," and was aimed at social workers and "others who have a stake in the welfare of the borough's citizens...to Board members and other volunteers, to participants in neighborhood organizations, civic and church leaders, etc." Some of these publications will be found in other series (for example, Series 3, Program activities); some publications missing in other series will be found here.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_97e2a6b94913a8b4749d0c9494030bb7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual Reports: BCSP</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1939/1943" type="inclusive">1939-1942/1943</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_bdbc2b2fb9c99799c36caef9a79455f4" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247295]" type="Box">65</container><container parent="aspace_bdbc2b2fb9c99799c36caef9a79455f4" type="Folder">9.1.001</container></did></c><c id="aspace_7203faa9e2b4a63c72370009fa42b9bf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual Reports: BCSP</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1943/1955" type="inclusive">1943/1944-1955</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_862ab999861f321400dd2e590a2cb069" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247295]" type="Box">65</container><container parent="aspace_862ab999861f321400dd2e590a2cb069" type="Folder">9.1.002</container></did></c><c id="aspace_947612d39c1ff5ec3b5e42b23e410807" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual Reports: Brooklyn Nutrition Committee</unittitle><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_5567608c1f28ae7e485760c39b702d25" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247295]" type="Box">65</container><container parent="aspace_5567608c1f28ae7e485760c39b702d25" type="Folder">9.1.003</container></did></c><c id="aspace_06555d52e0ce7ed84bb5adcb9db75ef2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual Reports: Group Work and Recreation Division</unittitle><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_edb13188474d68d6dd04516ccde6d9c6" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247295]" type="Box">65</container><container parent="aspace_edb13188474d68d6dd04516ccde6d9c6" type="Folder">9.1.004</container></did></c><c id="aspace_9a2b3cd22e9e9ad4363b0fff9f6fc22d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual Reports: Veterans' Affairs Committee</unittitle><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_5db7091766ebbc0a77f780c24c4d4bec" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247295]" type="Box">65</container><container parent="aspace_5db7091766ebbc0a77f780c24c4d4bec" type="Folder">9.1.005</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b45401a56912fa3251112e125aa190c4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Age Will Be Served</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1948/1948">1948</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_260f8d0520aa6c4f827bc2b351ab923f" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247295]" type="Box">65</container><container parent="aspace_260f8d0520aa6c4f827bc2b351ab923f" type="Folder">9.1.006</container></did></c><c id="aspace_824da5e70f5206a4ef182fd8cdda3f72" level="file"><did><unittitle>Agencies Offering Services to Brooklyn Veterans</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1944/1944">1944</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_8a38836d378eb862be65333b76f2d83b" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247295]" type="Box">65</container><container parent="aspace_8a38836d378eb862be65333b76f2d83b" type="Folder">9.1.007</container></did></c><c id="aspace_1024bf6b483fef67ffcd898f662f8e4b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aids to Communication from Social Agency to School in Brooklyn</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1952/1952">1952</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_a886129f1ffa4616d4fdb2e541ab04d5" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247295]" type="Box">65</container><container parent="aspace_a886129f1ffa4616d4fdb2e541ab04d5" type="Folder">9.1.008</container></did></c><c id="aspace_038802ececafff1ebb3641ce85142d23" level="file"><did><unittitle>All About Brooklyn: a handbook for Brooklynites</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1957/1957">1957</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_101589ee34afd7fcd6e9d9a024d6d556" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247295]" type="Box">65</container><container parent="aspace_101589ee34afd7fcd6e9d9a024d6d556" type="Folder">9.1.009</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f91bd8485cf63bd6df4f61e85b0bf8be" level="file"><did><unittitle>BCSP brochure</unittitle><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1945/1945">circa 1945</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_ab8bca42beb6b8118646984316ca8dc1" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247295]" type="Box">65</container><container parent="aspace_ab8bca42beb6b8118646984316ca8dc1" type="Folder">9.1.010</container></did></c><c id="aspace_9ee1e62006d676de8b8806d8d12466c6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Brooklyn Health Council;

Planning from its founding until its dissolution in 1957, as well as articles on subjects of concern to the Council (pending social welfare legislation, funding for services, veterans issues, etc.). The pages covering 1933 include minutes of meetings, meeting agendas, and form letters as well. The earliest clippings chronicle the founding of the organization; the last describe its demise. The majority of articles clipped are from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle; other New York City newspapers, including The New York Times are also represented.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_7e16fbfa28fe7beeaf3fc217b83c2228" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1933-01/1933-06" type="inclusive">1933 January-June</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_c23fad3b4c977a4c9d97e2c8595d1b4e" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247311]" type="Box">67</container><container parent="aspace_c23fad3b4c977a4c9d97e2c8595d1b4e" type="Folder">10.1.001</container></did></c><c id="aspace_9db380d95aaf4da13327ee0dc37fd38f" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1933-07/1934" type="inclusive">1933 July-1934</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_115f41756f2cd9994be59273e33f5b7d" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247311]" type="Box">67</container><container parent="aspace_115f41756f2cd9994be59273e33f5b7d" type="Folder">10.1.002</container></did></c><c id="aspace_580e13814165dd2efb1f0cfd6ebdacaa" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1935/1938" type="inclusive">1935-1938</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_e088b5951e859f0bcb17525f65fb7d82" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247311]" type="Box">67</container><container parent="aspace_e088b5951e859f0bcb17525f65fb7d82" type="Folder">10.1.003</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6e69824e87cdb73cb8f2b5cbb8bfc7cd" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1939/1940" type="inclusive">1939-1940</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_8009b334ec0e0a9058dc407daca4ab93" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247311]" type="Box">67</container><container parent="aspace_8009b334ec0e0a9058dc407daca4ab93" type="Folder">10.1.004</container></did></c><c id="aspace_395cb908d7701e7d62aa8fad12a1af83" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1934/1947" type="inclusive">1934-1947</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_61b303c8169ae10c9def4be044055d53" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247311]" type="Box">67</container><container parent="aspace_61b303c8169ae10c9def4be044055d53" type="Folder">10.1.005</container></did></c><c id="aspace_25a887831ade9394bf6069df85906708" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1948/1950" type="inclusive">1948-1950</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_274e13852da859a2807ca616a47e8fc4" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247311]" type="Box">67</container><container parent="aspace_274e13852da859a2807ca616a47e8fc4" type="Folder">10.1.006</container></did></c><c id="aspace_c1dd951d2b1617706326acf65f8a9b6e" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1951/1955" type="inclusive">1951-1955</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_d66d9664456ac8d94fc4b25895555542" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247311]" type="Box">67</container><container parent="aspace_d66d9664456ac8d94fc4b25895555542" type="Folder">10.1.007</container></did></c><c id="aspace_eff3c984cc50a0c1b87261720345da87" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="other" normal="1956/1957" type="inclusive">1956-1957</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Letter" id="aspace_a19625183280ecc5543fad2580e7ae8e" label="Mixed Materials [34444506247311]" type="Box">67</container><container parent="aspace_a19625183280ecc5543fad2580e7ae8e" type="Folder">10.1.008</container></did></c></c></dsc>
