    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>In 1883, a group of German Jewish immigrants began meeting for religious purposes in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. The Congregation Bikur Cholim was officially incorporated in 1886. That same year, members raised sufficient funds to purchase and refurbish the Trinity Episcopal Church as their temple, which was located on Wyona Street between Atlantic Avenue and Fulton Street. The congregation popularly became known as the Wyona Street Temple. Between 1920 and 1921, the congregation changed its name to Temple Sinai of Brooklyn after constructing, dedicating, and occupying a new building at 24 Arlington Avenue (at Bradford Street).  The Congregation purchased its first burial site in Bayside Cemetery, Queens, New York, and in 1914 purchased a large section in Mount Judah Cemetery, Cypress Hills, New York.  The Young Folks League was an active auxiliary of the congregation. Temple Sinai of Brooklyn folded in 1986 as the last surviving synagogue in East New York.  Morris Goldschmidt was president of the congregation from 1915 to 1917 and a member of its Board of Trustees for many years.</p><p>More information on the Temple Sinai of Brooklyn is available online at the <extref xlink:href="http://www.tapeshare.com/TempleSinai.html">East New York Project</extref> (http://www.tapeshare.com/TempleSinai.html).</p><p>The information provided in this note was provided by the paper's donor, William H.
