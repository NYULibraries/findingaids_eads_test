The bulk of the collection includes documents supporting the assessments to be levied for sewer projects; the binders of this material include maps of the blocks and lots relevant to a sewer project, lists of property owners, and certifications. The bulk of these materials are from the twentieth century (circa 1900-1960), but there are also many binders from the late nineteenth century. There are a few assessment binders from prior to the 1880s, with the earliest dating from 1859. Other materials in the collection include blueprints of sewer projects and designs, field books concerning special sewer structures, notes on land valuation assessments, journals of work on particular projects, materials test results, and other matter. The bulk of this other material is from the early decades of the twentieth century, up to the 1930s. The latest material in the collection are excavation notices from the late-1980s.</abstract>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Several volunteers were responsible for processing the assessment binders (series 1), which comprise the bulk of the collection, between June 2011 and January 2012. Alison Bunis and Willy Gillespie did preparatory arrangement and photocopying work for the Transitional and Post-Consolidation binders. Alison also processed the Transitional Sub-series. A team of volunteers from the firm Goldman Sachs arranged much of the Post-Consolidation Sub-series and processed the bulk of the Ocean Front district binders. Ted Rizzo processed the bulk of the assessment binders, including those in the Post-Consolidation Sub-series and the Brooklyn District Sub-series. The overall collection arrangement was managed by archivist Larry Weimer, who also described the collection and processed all material other than the Transitional, Post-Consolidation and Brooklyn District assessment binders.</p><p>The collection combines the following accessions: 1978.144, 1985.057, 1993.009, and 2011.010.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>In the mid-19th century, the City of Brooklyn made a serious effort to tackle its sewage and waste problems. As with the rest of the United States, Brooklyn (as did Manhattan) lacked underground sewage systems. With the outbreak of cholera and other infectious diseases circa 1830, combined with an ever-rising population, the City of Brooklyn established a Board of Sewer Commissioners in 1857 to deal with its formidable sewage disposal problems. Still, sewage disposal consisted mostly of drainage, and it wasn't until the last quarter of the 19th century that the construction of underground sewage systems began in Brooklyn. With the consolidation of Flatbush and the other municipalities of Kings County into the borough of Brooklyn in the late 1800s, the expansion of the sewer system continued well into the twentieth century.</p>  </bioghist>

For each project the relevant documents were compiled in an "assessment binder." The documents include maps of the blocks and lots relevant to a sewer project, lists of the property owners by lot, name of the contractor engaged in the project, and certifications about the project and the provided information. There are few technical project details in the material as the documents seem to focus on setting the assessments rather than on project construction.</p><p>The bulk of the material dates from circa 1900 to 1930 and concerns the development of the Bay Ridge, Flatbush, and "Ocean Front" (e.g., Flatlands, Gravesend) districts in the consolidated borough of Brooklyn. Nonetheless, there is substantial material pre-dating Brooklyn's 1898 consolidation with New York City. The earliest of these pre-consolidation binders date from circa 1859, with the bulk from the 1880s-1890s. There are also about 200 binders from the years around consolidation, about 200 binders from the mid-twentieth century (circa 1943-1962), and a small number of Queens County assessment binders from the early twentieth century.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2_n0l" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Sub-series 1: Pre-Consolidation</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">7.5 Linear Feet</extent><extent altrender="carrier">in six record cartons</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1859/1897" type="inclusive">circa 1859-circa 1897</unitdate><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1883/1897" type="bulk">1883-1897</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_5007dda6f2ca9b8fb9cf35e039858a87"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The sub-series has three levels of arrangement.

Because this sub-series is arranged by the alphabetical designation of the various sewer maps, the 1875 map of the entire system provides a key for understanding the geographic range of each part of the sub-series.

These numbers ranged from 1 to circa 3200. In an effort to enhance user access to the collection, the archivist referred to a document within each binder to determine the local sewer district approving the project (e.g., Bay Ridge, Flatbush, etc.). The binders are arranged in alphabetical order by these local sewer districts. Binders referring to two districts are placed with the first district appearing alphabetically (e.g., binders referring to both Flatbush and New Lots districts follow the Flatbush only binders). Within each district, the binders are arranged by assessment binder number. (The first 200 or so post-consolidation binders had no reference to a local sewer district; these binders were organized separately by the archivist, in the <emph render="bold">Transitional</emph> sub-series. A few later-dated binders with no referenced district were retained in the <emph render="bold">Post-consolidation</emph> sub-series as "Unspecified.")</p><p>The districts appear as follows:</p><p>Bay Ridge</p><p>Bay Ridge and Flatbush</p><p>Bay Ridge, Flatbush, and Prospect Heights</p><p>Bedford</p><p>Bedford and Williamsburg</p><p>Bushwick</p><p>Bushwick and Williamsburg</p><p>Flatbush</p><p>Flatbush and New Lots</p><p>Flatbush and Ocean Front</p><p>Flatbush and Prospect Heights</p><p>Greenpoint</p><p>Heights</p><p>New Lots</p><p>Ocean Front</p><p>Prospect Heights</p><p>Prospect</p><p>Prospect and River Front</p><p>Red Hook</p><p>River Front</p><p>Williamsburg</p><p>Unspecified District</p><p>In its original state, most of the material was held in hard-cover binders by metal fasteners; in these cases, the material was removed from the binders. The cover of the first 1000 or so original binders included a project description; this was photocopied and included with the retained documents (generally, the retained documents also include a form of this description, but a photocopy was taken in case the cover referenced additional details). Most of the documents refer to the original assessment binder number, but when they did not, the archivist noted the binder number in [brackets] on both the photocopy of the cover and on an internal document before discarding the binder cover.</p><p>Approximately 1600 of the original binders recorded on the inside cover the date that the material was "confirmed by the Board of Assessors."
