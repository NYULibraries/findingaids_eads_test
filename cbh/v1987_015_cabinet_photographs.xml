      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Cabinet photographs, also called cabinet cards, were commercially produced photographic portraiture that were first introduced in the 1860s. Cabinet photographs, measuring 4.5 x 6.25 inches, consist of a photographic print (generally albumen) that is mounted on a thick card. The cards often include decorative or embossed lettering on the front and reverse of the card that note the photographer or photographic studio that produced the photograph. The popularity of cabinet photographs lasted from the 1860s through the 1890s, though they were continued to be made into the first quarter of the 20th century.</p>

      <p>The Collection of cabinet photographs from Brooklyn photography studios include three items dating from circa 1870 to 1900.The three cabinet photographs are black-and-white studio portraits of one unidentified man, one man identified as Leroy, and one women identified as Grandma Sieman. The three Brooklyn-based photography studios that produced the photographs are: Richardson Brothers whose studio was located at 113 and 115 Broadway, below Bedford Avenue; Chapman &amp; Co. located at 364 and 365 Bedford Avenue; and S. Olsen located at 240 Columbia Street. It is not known if the individuals in the portraits are related, but the handwritten identifications appear to be written by the same person. The cabinet photographs were donated to the Brooklyn Historical Society, via the Brooklyn Museum, from the St. Augustine Historical Society which is located in St. Augustine Florida.</p>
