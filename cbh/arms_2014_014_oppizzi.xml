    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Angela Boglioli Oppizzi was born in 1921 in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of immigrants from Northern Italy (Alpe di Bedonia â€“ Parma) who came to the United States in 1911.  From 1926 to 1946, she lived with her parents at 94 Tillary Street, Brooklyn, in a third floor walk-up, cold-water flat.  Coming of age during the Depression, Mrs. Oppizzi had to abandon her goal of becoming a teacher and go to work to help support her family.  Her first job after graduating from Bushwick High School was with the Permit Division of the New York City Board of Health, secured through the Work Projects Administration (WPA).  Shortly after Pearl Harbor Day, Angela obtained a position with the Mutual Broadcasting Network, eventually becoming private secretary to the program director for over 12 years.  She met her future husband, Carlo "Charlie" Oppizzi in New York City in late 1941; they married in 1945 when he returned to New York on medical leave after more than two years fighting in New Guinea.   Rejoining the workforce after her two daughters began school, Mrs. Oppizzi was the secretary to successive chiefs of staff at SUNY Downstate Medical Center for over 20 years.  She later moved to Virginia where she was a secretary for the Norfolk Public Schools. Mrs. Oppizzi died in Virginia Beach, Virginia in April 2010.</p>  </bioghist>
