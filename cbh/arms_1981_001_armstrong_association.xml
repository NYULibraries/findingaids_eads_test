      <abstract id="aspace_7f0436c7ca0ec0bab030d73df8f11041">The Brooklyn Armstrong Association was formed in 1906, renamed the Brooklyn Hampton Association in 1920, and disbanded in 1943. The Association was formed principally as a vehicle for Brooklynites to support the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute and to engage with matters of African-American "uplift." The collection includes material from throughout the life of the organization, including: a scrapbook of clippings about events and meetings, solicitations, meeting invitations, announcements, reports, membership lists, Hampton Institute publications, and the like; some annual reports; minute books for the Executive Committee and Annual meetings; and correspondence, mostly from 1943 concerning the final days of the organization.</abstract>

      <p>The Brooklyn Armstrong Association was formed in 1906, at least in part to accommodate Brooklyn residents who were members of the Armstrong Association of New York. The Association's aim was "to stimulate public interest in the work and influence of the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute and generally in the uplifting of the Negro and Indian races." The organization held public lectures and collected contributions for the Hampton Institute. In late 1920, the organization changed its name to the Hampton Association of Brooklyn (more commonly referred to as the Brooklyn Hampton Association). The organization disbanded in 1943.</p>

      <p>The collection includes material from throughout the life of the Brooklyn Armstrong (1906-1920) and Hampton (1920-1943) Associations. A scrapbook (1906-1939) includes clippings about events and meetings (notably a visit to Brooklyn by Booker T. Washington and Secretary of War Taft), solicitations, meeting invitations, announcements, reports, membership lists, Hampton Institute publications, and the like. There are some annual reports in the collection. There are minute books (1906-1943) for the Executive Committee and Annual meetings. There is a small amount of correspondence, principally from 1943, concerning the final days of the organization.</p>
