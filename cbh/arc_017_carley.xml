      <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Walter A. Carley was born near the turn of the twentieth century and grew up in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. He completed his childhood schooling and confirmation at St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church and School on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint in June, 1907. Carley then attended St. John's College, now St. John's University, in Brooklyn from 1907-1909. He served in World War I as a Navy seaman and storekeeper at St. Julian's Creek in Portsmouth, Virginia from 1918-1919. An honorable discharge followed in 1921. Other than Carley's military service records and veteran insurance records, there is little indication that Carley had any lasting involvement with the United States Navy after his World War I post.</p>
      <p>
As an active member of the Knights of Columbus (K of C), Lexington Council, No. 293, based in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Carley served as the chair of multiple publicity and advertising committees. He was also an active member of the Greenpoint Peoples Regular Democratic Organization (GPRDO). This political organization fostered Regular Democratic values and promoted the Regular Democratic agenda throughout Brooklyn. The Regular Democrats tended to be conservative in apposition to Reform Democrats who espoused to be against the democratic "machine" of city, state and local government. Carley is cited on the Web site "<emph render="italic">The Political Graveyard</emph>" as a Brooklyn Delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940, 1944, and 1948. The U.S. Democratic National Party possesses further information about convention delegates. It may also be helpful to consult local and national papers for Convention coverage and delegate listings (e.g., <emph render="italic">The Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph>, <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph>, etc.). It is unclear whether politics served as Carley's sole profession. The collection provides no evidence supporting the pursuit of another occupation. According to his personal records, Carley's father, Edward Carley, was the owner of a Brooklyn plumbing business. If Carley inherited this business, there is no record of it in the collection. See Brooklyn city directories for this era.</p>
      <p>
The only other family member mentioned in the collection is Carley's sister, Emily Carley. Included in the collection is her confirmation certificate from St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church. </p>
      <p>Walter A. Carley died in 1956. His funeral was held at St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>
This collection highlights Carley's political and organizational involvement, but offers little insight into his personal life and family affairs.</p>

The arrangement consists of five series: <emph render="bold">Knights of Columbus (K of C) records</emph>; <emph render="bold">Greenpoint Peoples Regular Democratic Organization (GPRDO) records</emph>; <emph render="bold">Walter A. Carley papers</emph>; <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph>; and <emph render="bold">Postcards</emph>. The first three series contain souvenir programs, posters and ephemera from theater performances, balls and dinners. The remainder of the K of C and GPRDO records consists of business records, meeting minutes and correspondence for the various committees Carley was involved in within these organizations, as well as periodicals and news clippings. Carley's personal records include records of his schooling, his Catholic affiliations and activities, his World War I service and subsequent veteran status, sheet music and a small portion of his father's business records. The photographs include images of Carley, group photographs and a portrait of Rose M. Casey. The picture postcards mostly pertain to the K of C Institute in Brooklyn.</p>

          <p>The materials in this series date from 1917-1931, however the bulk of the materials date from 1919-1928. This series also contains undated materials. Included in the series are financial records and correspondence from the Knights of Columbus, Lexington Council, No. 293 journal and publicity committee, which Carley chaired in 1928. Carley also collected newspaper clippings relating to Knights of Columbus (K of C) events, from 1923-1929. Additionally, there are programs from K of C theater events, balls, dinners, brunches and religious events that comprise the bulk of the series. The programs include local business advertisements, as well as, names of local K of C members that provide a snapshot of Greenpoint from the 1920s through the 1940s. The K of C, Lexington Council, No. 293, of which Carley was a member, sponsored many of the events noted in the programs. However, the series contains a representative sample of materials from other Brooklyn, Long Island, and New York state chapters. Carley also collected multiple issues of various K of C chapter periodical bulletins. Two copies of the K of C publication, <emph render="italic">Columbia</emph>, have been placed with the oversized materials.</p>
