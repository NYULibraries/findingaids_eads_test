    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Theobald G. Wilson was born on January 10, 1923 in the San Juan Hill neighborhood of Manhattan. His mother was a Jamaican immigrant. He had two older sisters, Dorothy and Mavis. Wilson graduated from Dewitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. Before and after World War II he was a resident of the Harlem neighborhood of Brooklyn, where he befriended many political and cultural luminaries, such as Sammy Davis Jr., Percy Sutton, Al Sharpton, Alex Haley, Thelonius Monk, and Gordon Parks. Wilson enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941 and was invited to join the 99th Pursuit Squadron, which is popularly known as the Tuskegee Airmen. He served in North Africa and Italy as a parachute rigger and took up photography during his service to document his experiences. In the late 1940s he married Marie Dowell and they had two children, Sidney and Susannah. They lived at a number of locations in Manhattan, including 63rd and Amsterdam Avenue and the Amsterdam Houses (1948-1956). They then moved to Brooklyn, residing at 909 Belmont Avenue (1956-1963), 646 Eastern Parkway (1963), Underhill Avenue, Church Avenue and Ocean Avenue, Crown Street, 199 Lincoln Road, and finally 84 Ross Street (Bedford Gardens). Wilson ran a successful commercial photography business out of his home for several decades. His clients included corporations such as AT&amp;T and CBS, as well as numerous churches, fraternal organizations, and other organizations in Brooklyn, especially among West Indian communities. His wife, Marie Wilson, was a well-known quilter, president of the New York Quilter's Society, and was selected to coordinate the "Weaver of Dreams" quilt displayed at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta. Theobald was a member of the Church of St. Mark, which is located in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. Marie Wilson passed away in 1997 and Theobald Wilson passed away in 2012.</p>  </bioghist>

It includes photographic negatives, prints, transparencies, and Polaroids. The bulk of the photographs document his immediate family: his wife Marie, son Sidney, and daughter Susan. Marie's work as a quilter and bag maker is well documented in the series. Of particular note are images of the "Weaver of Dreams" quilt that was featured at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. Wilson's passion for the outdoors is also well documented. This includes fishing trips, such as local outings to Sheepshead Bay and Jamaica Bay, as well as trips to New England and North Carolina. It also includes photographs documenting trips to Medusa, New York and rifle shooting. Finally, the series includes photographs documenting Wilson's trip with other Tuskegee Airmen to President Barack Obama's inauguration in January 2009.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_8d890725393e8afa9d51cc4822144231" level="file"><did><unittitle>Family and others</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1920/2000" type="inclusive">circa 1920s-2000</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_e004611ff494fcd8af8ed2cd907887e3" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">30</container><container parent="aspace_e004611ff494fcd8af8ed2cd907887e3" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_0e051165bfe10f7fa75dce250529a2eb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Fishing</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1943/1995" type="inclusive">1943-1995</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_24aeea825b93a6de5f035713e3b2fef0" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">30</container><container parent="aspace_24aeea825b93a6de5f035713e3b2fef0" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6c1e567086ca0e9876949b474160d321" level="file"><did><unittitle>Theobald, family, and friends</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1952/1984" type="inclusive">1952-1984</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_d8b902ae2062603d64cbc74428a6c157" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">30</container><container parent="aspace_d8b902ae2062603d64cbc74428a6c157" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6e2845ee28902a518dab8cccefa1125a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sidney and Susan B.
