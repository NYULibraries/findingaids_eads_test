      <p>Founded in 1896, the Unity Club was a Brooklyn Jewish men's organization advocating social, philanthropic, and communal activities.  Originally located at Franklin Avenue and Hancock Street, the Club relocated to a clubhouse at Dean Street and Bedford Avenue in 1914, and again to a clubhouse at 101 Eighth Avenue in 1944.</p>
