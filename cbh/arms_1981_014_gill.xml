    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The diary of Roger Gill, a Quaker, documenting his trip to the American colonies in 1698 and 1699. The diary describes his travels to Quaker settlements in Long Island, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and other parts of the northeast. The volume is bound in vellum with 113 numbered pages and 6 unnumbered pages (one leaf, page 53/54 is missing). </p><p>Included with the diary is a typewritten transcription prepared by former Head Librarian of the Long Island Historical Society, Anne Gordon. Gordon wrote the transcription by hand during her tenure and typed the text in 2020. The transcription is prefaced by a bibliography, chronology, and index of names. Because Gill spelled most words phonetically and used no punctuation, Gordon modernized the spelling and added some punctuation for clarity. Pages 6 to 24, which contain an account of nautical details of Gill's voyage to America, were not transcribed.</p>  </scopecontent>
