    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>The Barkeloo family (also spelled Barkaloo, Barkelo, Barkulo, Borckelloo or Van Barkeloo) was among the earliest European settlers in present-day Brooklyn. Jacques (or Jaques) Barkeloo, to whom these papers refer, was the founder of Barkeloo cemtery, which was originally a family cemetery on the Barkeloo property and is now the smallest cemetery in Brooklyn. It is located in Bay Ridge on the corner of Narrows Avenue and MacKay Place. Jacques's grandson Teunis Suydam Barkeloo married Lammetje G. Bergen, sister of Teunis G. Bergen. Teunis and Lammetje's daughter Lemma (1840-1870) was one of the first women in America to attend law school and the first woman to try a case in an American court. She and her sister Joanna (1838-1909) are the "Joe and L. Barkeloo" in these papers.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
