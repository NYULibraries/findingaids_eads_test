    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Long Island Historical Society (LIHS) was founded during a time of tumultuous change. In only a few decades, Brooklyn had grown from a rural agricultural community to the third largest city in the country. Civic pride was at an all-time high. Many of Brooklyn's citizens believed they needed to commemorate their city's rural past before it quickly faded from memory.</p><p>Founders also envisioned the LIHS as a center for dialogue about history. In the nineteenth century, the society's roster of speakers included newspaper editor and reformer Horace Greeley, writer Arthur Conan Doyle and abolitionist and women's rights activist Julia Ward Howe. </p><p>In 1985, the institution changed its name to Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS). In 2020, BHS underwent another transformation by becoming part of Brooklyn Public Library under a new name: Center for Brooklyn History (CBH).</p>  </bioghist>
