    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Charles (Karl) Blieffert was born on May 10, 1891 in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn. His mother and father immigrated to the United States from Nuremberg, Germany. The family lived at 18th Avenue near Gravesend Avenue where Charles spent his childhood. He was the only child. While working in a Milwaukee insurance company during the Great Depression, he met his future wife Helene. They married after the death of both of Charles' parents. Charles and his wife spent their summers at a fisherman's lake cottage in Wisconsin. He died in May of 1984, at age 92. He Americanized his birth name "Karl" to "Charlie" and pronounced his last name "Bly-furt" rather than "Blee-furt."</p>  </bioghist>
