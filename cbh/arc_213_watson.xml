The subjects are chiefly buildings, structures, and monuments located in Brooklyn. Images of Prospect Park and Coney Island are also well-represented in the series. The series includes interior, exterior, and detail views of buildings, as well as street views of Brooklyn and beach views of Coney Island and Manhattan Beach, among others. The prints often include information regarding the architect and the architectural design of each individual building. Building types include, but are not limited to, commercial buildings, schools, communication buildings, societies' buildings, religious buildings, municipal buildings, fraternal buildings, military buildings, dwellings, theaters, and banks.</p></scopecontent></c></dsc>
