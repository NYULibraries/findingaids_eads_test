      <abstract id="aspace_01cdf858737d10fba10a50aaab324911">The Isaac and Silas Ludlam papers document the surveying activities of the Ludlams in Brooklyn between 1826 and 1839. During this period, the Ludlams were frequently sought out to perform a variety of surveys for public officials of the village, and later the city, of Brooklyn, and for private citizens. The bulk of the collection is composed of correspondence addressed to Isaac, Silas, or both requesting surveying services. The writers of these letters include many prominent citizens of 19th century Brooklyn, such as Joshua Sands, Joseph Sprague, Richard Stanton, Gabriel Furman, as well as other trustees, aldermen, village presidents, and Brooklyn mayors. Most of the collection relates to property in Brooklyn Heights, though some correspondence also references the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>The Ludlam family had a long history of employment as surveyors for the village, city, and borough of Brooklyn. Stephen Ludlam was the first, being appointed in 1809. He was followed by his son Silas in 1834, and preceded by grandsons and great-grandsons into the 20th century. Silas Ludlam (1806-1892) was born in New  York City and began working as a surveyor in Brooklyn around 1827. He surveyed  farms and estates--such as those of the Duffield, Middagh, Remsen, Pierrepont, and  Jackson families--as Brooklyn's grew into a village and city. Silas lived and worked in the neighborhood now known as Brooklyn Heights; at the time of his  death, he lived at 176 Remsen Street. Isaac Ludlam (1800-1880) was born in Oyster  Bay, N.Y. and lived in New York City. He served as City Surveyor for almost 40  years and regularly surveyed properties in Brooklyn.</p>
