    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Hudson-Fulton Celebration was an event given in 1909 to commemorate the achievements of Henry Hudson, the English explorer credited with the European discovery in 1609 of the river now known as the Hudson River, and Robert Fulton, the engineer credited with the invention of the first commercially successful steamboat. The main pageant began at the Soldiers and Sailors' Memorial Arch in Brooklyn's Prospect Park Plaza and continued on Eastern Parkway to Buffalo Avenue. A major attraction of the pageant was the participation of the U.S. Navy Atlantic Fleet.</p><p>The donor described her experience at the celebration in notes that accompany this item: "My sister Ruth and I were dressed in Japanese costumes and rode on the Japanese float in the section of the parade on 4th Avenue, Brooklyn, which originated at the Fourth Avenue Methodist Church...refreshments at the church consisted of tea, rice cakes, and other Japanese delicacies, with ice cream for the chidlren."</p>  </bioghist>
