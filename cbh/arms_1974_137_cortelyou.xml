    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Isaac Cortelyou (1736-1811), the son of Jacques (1707-1765) and Marretje Cortelyou, was a member of the prominent Cortelyou family of Brooklyn, one of the early Dutch families to settle in the region.  In 1766, he married Altie Rapalje, and they lived for a time on the family farm in the town of New Utrecht that Isaac had inherited from his father.  Isaac was fence-viewer of New Utrecht in 1772, an overseer of the poor in 1774, and a deacon at the New Utrecht Dutch Reformed Church.  In the late 1780s, Isaac and Altie moved with their three daughters and five sons to a house on present-day Bay 11th Street in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst.  A wealthy man, Isaac Cortelyou owned 11 enslaved people.  He willed his farm on Bay 11th Street to his son Johannes Cortelyou (1777-1855), but upon Johannes's suffering a mental breakdown, family relative Timothy Townsend Cortelyou was appointed custodian of the property and sold it to Jacob Bennett in 1831.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
