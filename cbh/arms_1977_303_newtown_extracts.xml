    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection was reprocessed and the finding aid revised by Dee Bowers in 2023. A note in this collection pointed to two related bound volumes cataloged and shelved in the library. The archivist found that these volumes were also newspaper clippings and would be more appropriate as part of this collection. The catalog records were deleted. The clippings were photocopied and the originals discarded.</p>  </processinfo>
