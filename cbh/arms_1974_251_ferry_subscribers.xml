    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The first steam ferry to provide service across the East River between Brooklyn and New York City was the Fulton Ferry, which officially opened in 1814 and connected the two Fulton Streets on either side of the River.  Other early steam ferries between Brooklyn and New York included the South Ferry, which opened in 1836 and connected Atlantic Street in Brooklyn to New York's Whitehall Street, and the Hamilton Ferry, which opened in 1846 and connected Hamilton Avenue in Brooklyn to the Battery in New York.  By 1854, several competing ferry lines between Brooklyn and New York were consolidated by the Union Ferry Company.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
