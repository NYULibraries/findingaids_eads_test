    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Female Union Society for the Promotion of Sabbath Schools was founded in 1816 by Joanna Graham Bethune, who along with her mother, Isabella Marshall Graham, had been longtime proponents of establishing Sunday Schools in New York City for the purpose of teaching reading and writing to impoverished children. The Society established several nondenominational Sunday schools throughout New York City that taught several thousand students.</p>  </bioghist>
