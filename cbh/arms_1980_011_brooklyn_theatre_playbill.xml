    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Theatre at the corner of Washington and Johnson Streets was one of Brooklyn's first successful legitimate theaters. On the night of December 5, 1876, approximately 1,000 people were watching a popular melodrama, "The Two Orphans." Many were crowded into the modestly-priced upper gallery seats. At 11:15 PM, shortly after the opening of the last act, a fire broke out, apparently caused by scenery touching the gas lights. The actors urged the audience to remain in their seats, but as the flames grew more noticeable, many rushed for the doors. There were few exits from the galleries, and panic ensued as hundreds rushed for the two narrow stairways. Many were trampled or collapsed, further jamming the stairs. The theater was destroyed within fifteen to twenty minutes and neither police nor observers at the scene were aware of the large number of people trapped in the building. Firemen were unable to enter the theater until the next morning, when they discovered the large number of bodies. More than 300 lives were lost, and many of the bodies could not be identified. It was the worst common disaster in Brooklyn's history, and the city went into a period of mourning. On Saturday, December 9th, the City of Brooklyn held a public funeral for 100 of the victims who were buried in a mass grave atop Battle Hill in a plot donated by Green-Wood Cemetery. Three crowded memorial meetings were held simultaneously around the city on the following day, with hundreds of mourners unable to enter the meetings.</p>    <list type="ordered">
