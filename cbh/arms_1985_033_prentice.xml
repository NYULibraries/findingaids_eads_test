    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Prentice family resided in Cambridge, MA; Alstead, N.H.; and parts of New York State.  Family members represented in this collection include Sartell Prentice and his wife, Jemima Parmele, who together moved to Canton, N.Y. in 1816, and later settled in Albany.  Their son, John H. Prentice (1803-1881), married the daughter of Deacon Davis of Albany, and in 1839 he relocated to Brooklyn, where he lived with his wife and 11 children at 1 Grace Court in the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights.  Prentice was a businessman and owner of Prentice's Stores, a series of warehouses that were located on the piers that once lined the Brooklyn side of the East River. Prentice served as president of the Brooklyn Board of Water Commissioners, was one of the first Parks Commissioners in Brooklyn, and was treasurer of the Board of Trustees of the East River Bridge (now the Brooklyn Bridge).</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
