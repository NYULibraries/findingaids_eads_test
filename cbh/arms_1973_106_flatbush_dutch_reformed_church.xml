    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Flatlands Dutch Reformed Church collection dates from the period circa 1680 to 1930 and consists of eight original and copied documents relating to the establishment and early activities of the Church in the 17th and 18th centuries.  Documents also concern the affairs of the Church's ministers and parishioners, as well as the Church's connection to the Dutch Reformed churches in the towns of Brooklyn, Bushwick, Flatbush, and New Utrecht.  The majority of the documents are written in Dutch, with only a few being accompanied by English translations.  Remaining documents are in English.  All documents are accompanied by explanatory notes illuminating their contents.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Flatlands Dutch Reformed Church was formed in 1654 in the Dutch town of New Amersfoort, one of the six original towns comprising the present-day borough of Brooklyn, and now known as the neighborhood of Flatlands.  The Church's first building was erected at a site near the present-day intersection of Kings Highway and East 40th Street, and stood until 1794.  As of 2011, the current Church building is the third one to occupy the original site.  The building, constructed in 1848, was designated a New York City landmark in 1973.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
