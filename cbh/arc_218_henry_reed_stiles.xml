    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes correspondence received by Henry Reed Stiles principally in response to his requests for historical information in connection with his writing of <emph render="italic">A History of the City of Brooklyn</emph>. (Stiles's <emph render="italic">History</emph> is available in the BHS library; call number Ref.F129.B7.S79.) The bulk of the correspondence concerns religious institutions and congregations, including their dates of organization, leadership (e.g., founders, ministers, trustees, etc.), history, places of worship in Brooklyn (including Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Greenpoint), and other information. Baptist, Congregational, Episcopal, Jewish, Lutheran, Methodist Episcopal, Presbyterian, Reformed Dutch, and Universalist congregations are represented in the correspondence. One African-American church, Siloam Presbyterian, is included. Material concerning Sabbath schools and missions to particular communities, especially German immigrants, is included. The correspondents generally are ministers, former ministers, or other such leaders of the organization described. Because the correspondence is in response to Stiles's inquiries, the content of the material is generally consistent across organizations, but ranges from spare details to more substantive comment. </p><p>A small number of institutions other than religious are represented in the collection.

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Henry Reed Stiles (1832-1909) was a physician who authored a number of historical and genealogical works in the second half of the nineteenth and into the early twentieth centuries, including the 3 volume <emph render="italic">A History of the City of Brooklyn</emph> (1867-1870). Though his medical career took him to places as disparate as Dundee, Scotland and Woodbridge, New Jersey, Stiles lived most of his life in New York City and in Brooklyn. He was a founder of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) in 1863 and served as the Society's first librarian. Further biographical information on Stiles can be found at his Wikipedia entry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Reed_Stiles.</p>  </bioghist>
