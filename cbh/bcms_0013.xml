    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Bernard "Bernie" Green was born in New York on September 14, 1908. His family name was Greenberg, but he used the name Green professionally, and was known to most friends and associates as "Bernie". Green received a music degree from the New York University College of Fine Arts in 1932 and worked principally in music, as a composer, conductor, and arranger for film, radio and television. He became widely known in the 1940s, when he earned a headlining spot on the Henry Morgan radio show. His better-known credits include the television shows "Mr. Peepers" and "Caesar's Hour". Green also worked in other facets of the show-business industry, recording albums, writing columns for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, The New York Times, and the International Musician, promoting fellow musicians like Les Brown, and writing comedy scripts.</p><p> In his later years, Green began preparations for a book he hoped to publish. He envisioned a collection of anecdotes by celebrities (many of whom he knew personally) about their mothers, and sent out letters requesting material from comedians, actresses, scientists, politicians, and other notable people. The replies he received make up much of this collection. The project was never completed, however, and Green died at the age of 66 at his home in Westport, Connecticut, on August 10, 1975.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The bulk of the Bernard Green collection is correspondence. Green was in the exploratory stages of writing a book of favorite stories by notable people about their mothers, and much of the correspondence relates to that project. Other highlights from the collection include a program from the "roasting" of Ed Sullivan by the Friars Club, sheet music, and a scrapbook of Green's column in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle.</p>  </scopecontent>
