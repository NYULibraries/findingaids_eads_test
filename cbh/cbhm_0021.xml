    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Victoria Law is a freelance journalist whose work focuses on the intersections of incarceration, gender and resistance. She is the author of <emph render="italic">Resistance Behind Bars: The Struggles of Incarcerated Women</emph> and <emph render="italic">"Prisons Make Us Safer" and 20 Other Myths About Mass Incarceration</emph>, co-author of <emph render="italic">Prison By Any Other Name: The Harmful Consequences of Popular Reform</emph>, and co-editor of <emph render="italic">Don't Leave Your Friends Behind: Concrete Ways To Support Families in Social Justice Movements and Communities</emph>.</p><p>In 2002, she was approached by women incarcerated at Oregon's Coffee Creek Correctional Facility who wanted to create a zine of incarcerated women's art and writings. Lacking resources such as photocopiers, postage and even the ability to write to people in other prisons, the women approached her to be the outside editor and publisher. The first issue of Tenacious was published in Spring 2002. Since then, Law has published 44 issues of Tenacious. The latest and last issue, in fall 2020, focused on the twin pandemics of coronavirus and systemic racism experienced by women (cis- and transgender) imprisoned across the country.</p><p>Law is also a co-founder of Books Through Barsâ€”NYC, an all-volunteer program that sends free books to people imprisoned across the country.</p>    <list type="ordered">
