    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Charles E. Scriven collection on Brooklyn history spans the period circa 1875 to 1915 and is comprised of materials either written or compiled by Scriven in the course of documenting the history of Brooklyn from the colonial period up to the early 20th century, with particular emphasis on the neighborhood of Flatbush.  Materials include typed original essays and transcriptions of articles and essays from various sources; news clippings; correspondence; and ephemera relating to a wide range of subjects such as banking, churches, civic organizations, government, homesteads, landmarks, libraries, public schools, public transit, public utilities, and realty development.  Specific subjects strongly represented include the consolidation of New York City in 1898, Erasmus Hall High School, the Flatbush Carnegie Library (later the Flatbush branch of the Brooklyn Public Library), the Flatbush Taxpayers' Association, Melrose Hall homestead, the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park, and the public water supply, among many others.  There are also numerous references to African Americans in Brooklyn, including a transcription of an article from <emph render="italic">The Rural</emph> concerning an investigation into the murder of an African American in 1872.  A small portion of the collection expands its focus beyond Brooklyn and relates to the history of the greater New York City area, such as papers on the origins of New York City street names and news clippings containing items of citywide historical interest.</p>  </scopecontent>
