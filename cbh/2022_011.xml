    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Brooklyn Heights is a neighborhood in northwestern Brooklyn, bounded to the west and north by Columbia Heights and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, to the east by Court Street and Cadman Plaza West, and to the south by Atlantic Avenue. Essentially, Brooklyn Heights became the world's first commuter suburb. By the 1830s and 1840s more substantial houses of brick and brownstone with Greek Revival details were being built farther south. During the following decades the houses grew larger, exhibiting the entire range of revival styles that swept American architecture: Italianate, Second Empire, Victorian Gothic, Romanesque, neo-Greco, and Classical Revival. Some of the houses belonged to merchants whose ships docked at the wharves below. Throughout the nineteenth century the neighborhood had an unmatched elegance. Using Gothic Revival, Greek Revival, and Italianate styles, Minard Lafever designed the Church of the Savior in Brooklyn Heights (1844, now First Unitarian Church).</p>    <list type="ordered">

<p>Three undated black and white photographs of street scenes in Brooklyn Heights taken during the late 19th or early 20th century. One photo is of the First Unitarian Congregational Society in Brooklyn on the corner of Pierrepont Street and Monroe Place. One photo was taken somewhere on Monroe Place and the other photo was taken somewhere on Remsen Street. The photos are mounted on board and appear to have been part of an album or scrapbook. Two photos have handwritten information about the subject beneath them. There are two 3.25 by 3.25 inch black and white photographs, each mounted on 5 by 5 inch boards that are both pasted on an 8.5 by 11.5 inch sheet of scrapbook paper and one 3.25 by 3 inch black and white photograph mounted on a 5 by 5 inch board.</p>  </scopecontent>
