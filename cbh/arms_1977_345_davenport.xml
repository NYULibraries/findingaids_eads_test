    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>The Davenport family of Brooklyn descended from the Reverend John Davenport, a Puritan minister who helped found the colony of New Haven and Yale University. Amzi B. Davenport (1817-1894), the son of William Davenport and Abigail Benedict, moved from Connecticut to Brooklyn in 1836. In Brooklyn, he opened the Willoughby Street Academy, served as a deacon of Plymouth Church, and worked in real estate in his later years. Amzi Davenport was also the author of <emph render="italic">The History and Genealogy of the Davenport Family in England and America</emph>, published in 1851, and a member of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society). </p><p>Amzi Davenport's son, Henry B. Davenport (1854-1920), was educated at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and worked as an attorney in Brooklyn. He was the founder and president of the Home Title Insurance Company, and a founder and officer of the Flatbush Savings Bank. Henry and his wife Flora Lufkin (m. 1877) had one son, Maurice Davenport.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
