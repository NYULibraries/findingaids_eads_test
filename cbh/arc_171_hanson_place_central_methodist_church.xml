      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The Hanson Place Central Methodist Church (now the Hanson Place Central United Methodist Church) was first organized as Hanson Place Methodist Episcopal Church in 1857. The original church was built on the corner of Hanson Place and St. Felix Street in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Fort Greene. The church building was declared unsafe in 1927 following the digging of subway lines and had to be demolished. The Church built again on the same site and the architecturally significant church was completed in 1931. The architecture firm of Halsey, McCormick, and Helmer designed the Modern Gothic/Art Moderne style church, as well as the adjacent landmarked Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower.</p>
