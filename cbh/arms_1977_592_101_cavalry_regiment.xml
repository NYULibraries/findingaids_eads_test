<p>The New York State National Guard 101st Cavalry Regiment was comprised of troops drawn mainly from Brooklyn and Manhattan, as well as Geneseo. It was originally organized during the Civil War as the 1st New York Cavalry Regiment, and participated in the Spanish-American War, the Mexican border dispute of 1916, and World War I before officially becoming the 101st Cavalry Regiment in 1922. Throughout most of World War II, the Regiment served at various locations throughout the United States before embarking to Europe in January of 1945 and returning home for deactivation in May of that year.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
