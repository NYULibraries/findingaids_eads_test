<p>George Edwin Wibecan (1832-1912) was born on St. Croix in the Danish West Indies and later immigrated to Liverpool, England. There he married Catherine Lawrence (1843-1916) in 1861. The couple had one child in England and then immigrated to Brooklyn, New York, where they had four more. Their second child, also George Edwin Wibecan, was born in Brooklyn in 1865. In 1899 he married Mabel Louise Bulkley (1875-1960) in Lansingburgh, New York, which was her home town. The couple resided on Pulaski Street in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, where they raised four children of their own. George was employed by the U.S. Postal Service for forty six years and was an active member of numerous fraternal and political organizations. He was a leader of the Henry Highland Garnet Republican Club, which was a Black Republican club based in Brooklyn, and was appointed Vice President of Kings County Republican Committee. He died in Brooklyn, New York, in 1946.</p>  </bioghist>
