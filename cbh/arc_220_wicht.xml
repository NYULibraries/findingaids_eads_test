      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Ken Wicht photograph collection consists of 19 photographic negatives (35mm) and one black-and-white print showing views of Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, with many views of Henry Street, circa 1980. The collection also includes six color slides of views of the Manhattan skyline and views of Brooklyn including the Williamsburg Savings Bank building at night, the Brooklyn Bridge (day and night views), the East River shot from under the Brooklyn Bridge, and the waterfront area of Greenpoint, circa 1982. The creator of the slides is unknown, but it is presumed that it was also Ken Wicht, the donor of the slides.</p>
