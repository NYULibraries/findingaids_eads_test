    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Art Union was founded in April 1850, reorganized circa January 1851 and renamed the Brooklyn Artists Art Union in April 1851. At that time, the organization's president was Henry J. Brent. Robert Hoskins served as secretary and later as treasurer. James McDonough also served as secretary in 1851, and may be the author of these minutes.</p><p>At an exposition in June of 1851 at 238 Fulton Street, the Union was scheduled to show member artwork and have a raffle with a door prize in order to raise funds. New York State officials viewed the event as gambling and enacted a law forbidding the exhibition. The Union presumably dissolved shortly thereafter.</p>  </bioghist>
