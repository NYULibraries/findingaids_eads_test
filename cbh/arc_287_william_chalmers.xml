<p>Accession 1980.029 (the 1891 paper) was purchased at the sale of Charles J. Werner's books at the American Art Association, 1927. Accession 1973.103 (the 1893) paper is annotated as having been obtained by C.J.W. (Charles J. Werner) from Chalmers' widow in 1919. It is not clear how the manuscript came to Brooklyn Historical Society, but it is likely that it was purchased in the same 1927 sale as that of 1980.029.</p>  </acqinfo>
