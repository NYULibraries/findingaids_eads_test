<p>The William H. Wadhams report consists of 410 typewritten pages housed in a single bound volume and dates to the period circa 1910. The report conveys Wadhams' findings and recommendations for reform of the Office of the State Superintendent of Elections for the Metrolopitan Elections District, which he had been appointed to investigate. Wadhams' recommendations for reform primarily pertained to redundancies and inefficiencies in staffing, as well as unnecessary monetary expenditures. The report contains some data on elections in Kings County.</p>  </scopecontent>
