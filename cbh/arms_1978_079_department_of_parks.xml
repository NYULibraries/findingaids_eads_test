    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The New York City Department of Parks was formed in 1934 when Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia discontinued the independent parks departments of the city's five boroughs and consolidated them to form a unifying administrative body to govern the entirety of the city's park system.  LaGuardia appointed Robert Moses as the Parks Department's first commissioner.  After becoming a branch of the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Administration under Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1968, the Parks Department was reorganized as the Department of Parks &amp; Recreation under Mayor Abraham D. Beame in 1976.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
