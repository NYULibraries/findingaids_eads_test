<p>The Town of Gravesend was one of the six original towns of Kings County.  Founded by religious dissenter Lady Deborah Moody and her followers in 1643, it was the only one of the original towns to be founded by English settlers.  Gravesend was annexed by the City of Brooklyn in 1894.</p>  </bioghist>
