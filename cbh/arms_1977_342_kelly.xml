    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>The following biography of James A. Kelly was written by Harriet Stryker-Rodda of the Long Island Historical Society in January 1966.</p><p>Born May 27, 1885 on a farm in Kurlagen, Longford County, Connaught Province, Ireland, James Angelo Kelly arrived in Brooklyn at the age of six. Here he lived in the old 10th Ward near Warren Street and Third Avenue, attending Our Lady of Mercy Parish School. Later he attended Heffley Institute and the Charles A. Marley School.</p><p>While working as construction foreman on the extension of the Interborough Subway at Greenwich and Dey Streets in New York in 1916, Jamie and his crew discovered the charred remains of Adrian Block's ship TIGER which had burned in November 1613. This only served to whet his appetite for things historical.</p><p>John J. Maloney of the Keith Vaudeville Circuit discovered Jamie who often entertained his fellow workers with his fine tenor voice and the songs he composed. A professional career as singer and composer followed. He shared top billing with such performers as McIntyre and Heath, composed for Blanche Ring and Anna Held. He toured the United States, England, and Canada. Upon his return to the United States he enlisted and became First Lieutenant, serving in France during the First World War with the 312th Engineers.</p><p>Back home again and realizing that vaudeville was dying, he entered politics where his career has been distinguished. He was appointed First Deputy County Clerk of Kings County on January 26, 1926 and served until February 1964. During that time he was called upon to perform their duties when five Kings County Clerks died in office. Because of his consuming interest in local history, Jamie was appointed Borough Historian and given charge of the newly formed Historical Division of the County Clerk's Office. In this position he created a historical division which has been recommended as a model for the 61 other counties of New York State. Believing that the history of a community belongs to the people, he collected, preserved, and made available the archives of Kings County to everyone. Carrying this belief to its logical conclusion brought Jamie into the teaching profession when he pioneered the teaching of local history on the collegiate level which resulted in the Brooklyn Historical Studies Institute of St. Francis College.</p><p>Honor after honor has been heaped upon Jamie Kelly by foreign nations, our Federal and State governments and local organizations for his life time of devotion to public service, international good will and local history. The list of honors like the list of his vast achievements is long.</p>  </bioghist>
