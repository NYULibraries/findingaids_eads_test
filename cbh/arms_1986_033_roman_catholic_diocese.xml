<p>The Diocese of Brooklyn was formed in 1853 to oversee all Roman Catholic churches in Kings, Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk counties of New York state. Based on Joralemon Street in Downtown Brooklyn, the Diocese of Brooklyn has remained one of the most populous diocese in the country. The Diocese oversees church parishes, schools, and charities affiliated with the Catholic church. In 1957, the Diocese of Rockville Centre was established, and Nassau and Suffolk counties split from the Diocese of Brooklyn to join this new jurisidiction.</p>  </bioghist>
