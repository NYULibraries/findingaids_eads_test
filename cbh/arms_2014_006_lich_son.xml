    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Long Island College Hospital (LICH) was founded in Brooklyn, New York, in 1858. The LICH Training School for Nurses, popularly known as the LICH School of Nursing, was established in 1883. Irene Sutcliffe, a graduate of the New York Hospital Training School, was selected to organize the school. The first class consisted of just three students. Irene Sutcliffe resigned her position in 1885 and was replaced by her twin sister, Ida Sutcliffe. During this period, the nurses' training program lasted two years, and there were no grades or examinations (the program would be expanded to three years in 1899).</p><p>The Alumnae Association of the Training School for Nurses was established in 1895. In 1904, Anne D. VanKirk replaced Isa Sutcliffe as head of the nursing school, and the school's training regimen was updated to conform with New York state guidelines. VanKirk was replaced by Miss E. Robinson, herself a graduate of the LICH School of Nursing, in 1920.</p><p>The school received temporary accreditation from the National League of Nursing in 1953. 1958 marked the first year that male students were admitted to the school. LICH became affiliated with Long Island University in 1960, which resulted in a new emphasis on academics at the nursing school (for the first time liberal arts were included in the school's curriculum). In 1962, the three year program was reduced back to a two year program (it would be shortened again to 22 months in 1975). The school switched academic affiliations twice in the ensuing years, to Packer Collegiate Institute in 1969 and then to St. Francis College in 1972.</p><p>In 1977 the school moved to St. Peter's School at 397 Hicks Street. The class of 1977 was the first to receive Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees. The school's academic affiliation changed once again in 1979 to Brooklyn College. Evening classes were first established in 1981, and primarily catered to men who chose nursing as a second career.</p><p>In May 2011, LICH became part of the SUNY Downstate Medical Center, and was renamed University Hospital of Brooklyn at Long Island College Hospital. Soon thereafter it was announced the LICH School of Nursing would no longer accept new students into its nursing program. The school officially closed in May 2013, and soon thereafter the Long Island College Hospital also closed.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>The Centennial: 1883-1983, Long Island College Hospital School of Nursing yearbook, 1983</p><p>History - Second Fifty Years - 1933-1983 - of the School of Nursing - Long Island College Hospital, 1983</p><p>LICHSON Chronicles, Spring 2013</p>  </bioghist>

They were produced by nursing students and offer an overview of the year's graduating class, with focus paid to connections among students and faculty. </p><p>The yearbooks contain a letter from the dean to the students; a section featuring faculty members (and occasionally administrative staff); a graduating class portrait; individual portraits of the graduates (sometimes featuring a personalized blurb); candid photographs of students during their studies, as well as snapshots taken during leisure time showing interactions amongst students and faculty;  advertisements for local businesses; and dedications to individual students and the graduating class. </p><p>Older yearbooks feature poetry and essays by students and faculty interspersed throughout the book. These feature thoughts and feelings on nursing and time spent at LICH SON.</p><p>The centennial edition of the yearbook in 1983 is notable for the comprehensive history of nursing included in the beginning of the book, which illuminates LICH SON's place in nursing history.</p><p>A few yearbooks contain handwritten notes and autographs of classmates.</p><p>Please note that the series does not contain yearbooks from the following years: 1883-1928, 1930-1944, 1952, 1966, 1970-1971, 1989-1991, 1995, 2001-2002 and 2013.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_02ab2b810801bf815667f1608efbd89d"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref129_a6p" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yearbooks</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1929/1949" type="inclusive">1929-1949</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_ffd5e485a9d3e378ed49766ef3cedabd" label="Text" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_ffd5e485a9d3e378ed49766ef3cedabd" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref130_od6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yearbooks</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1949/1954" type="inclusive">1949-1954</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_7b997465d4d66a7b952c9b80f1739390" label="Text" type="Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_7b997465d4d66a7b952c9b80f1739390" type="Folder">-</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref131_7sv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yearbooks</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1954/1960" type="inclusive">1954-1960</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_8d43665465686f9a32d9fb60ba55545f" label="Text" type="Box">9</container><container parent="aspace_8d43665465686f9a32d9fb60ba55545f" type="Folder">-</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref132_7dl" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yearbooks</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1961/1963" type="inclusive">1961-1963</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_3852fb966a33ff51589c79c834addf73" label="Text" type="Box">10</container><container parent="aspace_3852fb966a33ff51589c79c834addf73" type="Folder">-</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref133_meg" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yearbooks</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1963/1973" type="inclusive">1963-1973</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_174c9ff5883941f7de6b8eda4360b1b8" label="Text" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_174c9ff5883941f7de6b8eda4360b1b8" type="Folder">-</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref134_6ti" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yearbooks</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1974/1982" type="inclusive">1974-1982</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_505bfc5cfb3b37442b80594d50713307" label="Text" type="Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_505bfc5cfb3b37442b80594d50713307" type="Folder">-</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref135_5yw" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yearbooks</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1983/1994" type="inclusive">1983-1994</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_e4eeaee14fb787de0b8cc8b14b76ca65" label="Text" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_e4eeaee14fb787de0b8cc8b14b76ca65" type="Folder">-</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref136_m8c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yearbooks</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1996/2007" type="inclusive">1996-2007</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_452c78031ae07bd32536cf91a92c4147" label="Text" type="Box">14</container><container parent="aspace_452c78031ae07bd32536cf91a92c4147" type="Folder">-</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref137_lh9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yearbooks</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2008/2012" type="inclusive">2008-2012</unitdate><container altrender="Medium Flat Box 17" id="aspace_4eeef110b9015454e65c833b4b61a83f" label="Text" type="Box">15</container><container parent="aspace_4eeef110b9015454e65c833b4b61a83f" type="Folder">-</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f2d03ca884353dd80d75b05e098b3f45" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yearbook Photos</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2006/2009" type="inclusive">2006-2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_cbbdd2faf6377184f1115d3f8c5de0e9" label="Mixed Materials" type="Disk">digital files</container></did><phystech id="aspace_f7bb91e53b91271e0a084966334a2f94"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Digital portrait, IDs 2014_006_media_006 (70 JPEG files), 2014_006_media_007 (60 JPEGS), 2014_006_media_008 (164 JPEGS), and 2014_006_media_014 (3 JPEGS).

Produced by staff members and students, the featured material ranges from campus events, to essays by patients at the hospital, to descriptions of alumnae vacations. This series presents a comprehensive look at a long standing teaching hospital in Brooklyn, New York. As the material begins in 1930, there is little to no information about the college from its founding in 1857 to 1929.</p><p>Nurses Alumnae Quarterly features articles about general health, new laboratory facilities, the Biennial Convention of 1930, obituaries, an original essay by a patient, and class news.</p><p>The Alumnae Bulletin was produced by the LICH Alumnae Association Publication and Press Committee in order to keep the students and staff informed about various activities of the Alumnae Association and the individual nurses.

The issue features news for the student body about campus events and other school related announcements.</p><p>LICHSON Newsletter was produced by the school's Dean, Nancy M. DiMauro, in 2009. This issue is the first produced after a few years hiatus from any published newsletter for the school. It discusses the rejuvenation of the newsletter effort and a desire to reach out to the student body again and engage the alumni and current students in campus wide community events. Included is an autobiographical essay by LICH SON faculty member  Irene Rempel.</p><p>LICHSON Chronicles was produced by the LICH SON newsletter staff from 2012 to 2013. This issue is the final issue as the school closed its doors in May 2013.
