<p>Andersonville Prison Hospital, represented in the collection through hospital records and registers, was located in southwest Georgia and operated for 15 months between 1864 and 1865. The site was used by the Confederate Army as a prisoner-of-war camp for captured Union soldiers. At the time of its closure, almost 13,000 Union soldiers had died at Andersonville. The records were collected by E. P. Hopkins, a captured Ohio soldier who worked as a Steward in the prison hospital.</p><p>Andersonville Prison, represented in the collection through its hospital records and registers, was located in southwest Georgia and operated for 15 months between 1864 and 1865.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Civil War collection measures 0.5 linear feet and dates from 1804 to 1865. The collection contains a variety of materials from New York and the Eastern United States, ranging from Confederate military records to ephemeral printed material. Document types in the collection include hospital records, roll books, registers, muster rolls, military orders, scrapbooks, broadsides, and ephemera.</p><p>The bulk of military records in the collection are records from the Andersonville Prison Hospital in Georgia. These records document the work of the hospital and doctors during the summer of 1864 with daily hospital admission lists, death registers, roll books, hospital registers, and daily medical officer reports. Registers from Andersonville list patient name, rank, company, and regiment. Other items related to the Confederate Army include a report on the Battle of Fair Oaks in 1862, and a muster roll of the 36th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, Company C, listing name, rank, and enlistment dates of soldiers in the company. Union Army materials in the collection originate from the 13th Regiment of the New York State National Guard, and primarily consist of printed orders issued to members of the regiment. </p><p>Broadsides and ephemera cover events and organizations local to Brooklyn, New York City, Queens, and Long Island from the early 19th century to the Civil War era. The broadsides provide discussion of local, regional, and national issues, such as drafts, slavery, temperance, elections, and political platforms, and represent organizations such as the National Freedman's Relief Association, the War Fund Committee of Brooklyn, and the Suffolk County Sabbath School Association. A small number of broadsides related to the election of 1864 are written in German. Printed ephemera includes promotional material for two Brooklyn newspapers, the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Evening Star</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Union</emph>. The collection also contains four scrapbooks--three with pro-Union envelopes and printed ephemera, collected by George R. Howell, and one with political cartoons from the election of 1864.</p>  </scopecontent>
