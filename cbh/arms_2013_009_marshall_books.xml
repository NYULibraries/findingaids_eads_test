    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Robert Arthur Graef (1879-1951) was an American illustrator. He was born on September 26, 1879, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York. In 1884, his family moved to Brooklyn, New York. He displayed artistic talent at a young age, and had his first illustration published in a local newspaper at the age of ten. He attended PS 78 in Brooklyn, and graduated from the Pratt Institute in 1896. That year the family moved to 399 Ocean Avenue, in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn. His father died in 1899, leaving the family a "significant fortune." Soon, Graef opened an art studio at 70 5th Avenue, in Manhattan, and his illustrations were sold to numerous magazines and other publications. He married Ethel Esther Leffingwell in 1908. Their first son, Frederick Leffingwell Graef, was born on September 13, 1909, followed by a second son, Robert Leffingwell Graef, on October 20, 1914. During World War I, "he contributed patriotic recruitment posters to the war effort." He became an early member of the Guild of Freelance Artists (later the Artists Guild) in 1921. In 1924, the family moved to 1910 Avenue I, in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. He continued to publish artwork in magazines, and in 1940 he illustrated a series of classic children's books for the McLoughlin Bros., Inc. He died at his home in Brooklyn on May 16, 1951.</p>    <list type="ordered">
