      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The Tompkins Avenue Congregational Church was organized in 1875 and originally met in a schoolhouse on Tompkins Avenue in Brooklyn, N.Y. As the membership increased, a larger building on Park Avenue was used to hold services. In 1888, the church's chapel was erected at Tompkins Avenue and McDonough Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Tompkins Avenue Congregational Church boasted a particularly large membership during its first 40 years--for instance, over 3,000 members were listed in the 1926 yearbook. In 1942, the church merged with the Flatbush Congregational Church.</p>
