      <p>The Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences evolved from the Brooklyn Apprentices' Library Association formed in 1823, largely through the efforts of Augustus Graham.  In 1825 the Marquis de Lafayette laid the cornerstone of a new building on Washington Street -- a memorable occasion for a young witness named Walt Whitman.  The Library was renamed the Brooklyn Institute in 1843 and remained essentially the same until about 1888 when a greatly expanded program into many branches of science and art was initiated.  Among the new division and departments added between 1890 and 1911 were (with year of opening):</p>
      <p>The Brooklyn Museum (1897)
The Brooklyn Children's Museum (1899)
The Brooklyn Academy of Music (absorbed in 1907)
Biological Laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor (1907)
The Brooklyn Botanic Garden (1911)</p>
      <p>A destructive fire at the Washington Street building in 1890 marred the accomplishments of a merger with the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences (BIA&amp;S) and reincorporation.  An ambitious plan for a new building near Prospect Park was conceived in the 1890's.  It was to house the Institute's library and a large museum complex.  A new building to replace the original Brooklyn Academy of Music edifice which was destroyed by fire in 1903 was begun in 1907.</p>
      <p>The parent BIA&amp;S transferred the Biological Laboratory to the Long Island Biological Association in the early 1920's now called Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory.  In the face of financial restraints brought on by the Depression, the Institute began narrowing its focus.  The Museum began concentrating on the collection of art objects, and beginning about that time, the different branches became more and more independent, such as the Academy of Music, which is now independently operated.</p>

      <p>Approximately 85% of the collection consists of publications, hard and softbound (including programs and exhibition catalogs), and the remainder correspondence and financial records.

      <p>The collection was arranged into series according to the four divisions of BIA&amp;S as described in the 1915-1916 BIA&amp;S Yearbook:</p>

      <p>Preliminary arrangement and description of Accession Number 1985.073 was completed by Manning Field, with additional arrangement and description by D.S. Moore in October of 1985.  The original finding aid noted that bound volumes of Yearbook (1890-1917); bound bulletins, guides, and reviews (1898-1933); and a series of Brooklyn Museum Quarterly v. 1-26 (1914-1958) were removed from this collection and placed in the Library.  In December, 2005, one record carton of related administrative files and three record cartons of programs (Acc. No. 2005.054) were added to this collection and a folder list was created by Flora A. Rodriguez.  In addition to a large quantity of programs and other publications, records documenting the Brooklyn Children's Museum's fundraising activities for its 50th Anniversary Gala Dinner and its 1949 Special Gifts Campaign; activities of the Women's Committee for the Academy Orchestra Series and the Women's Committee for the Boston Symphony Orchestra Concerts in Brooklyn; the Brooklyn Ballet Association Inc.; and an adolescent ballet club called the "Brooklyn Ballet Club" were added to the collection.</p>
