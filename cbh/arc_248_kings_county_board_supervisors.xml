    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Board of Supervisors of Kings County was the legislative body governing Kings County, N.Y. Taxes, bonds, and other county related laws were passed by the Board of Supervisors so long as the laws did not conflict with state or federal laws. A board member was elected from each ward in Kings County and an elected supervisor-at-large presided over the board. The supervisor-at-large had the power to veto the resolutions of the board. The minutes of meetings for the Board of Supervisors of Kings County were published in the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph>.</p>  </bioghist>
