    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p><emph render="italic">New Brooklyn</emph> was a quarterly magazine published by Motivational Communications, Inc.  Its first issue was published in the summer of 1978.  The magazine's name was inspired by the publisher's aim to reflect Brooklyn's rising reputation as a vibrant center of social, cultural, and commercial diversity, while also paying tribute to Brooklyn's historic legacy.  Articles and features spotlighted Brooklyn's neighborhoods, arts and culture scenes, social life, commercial and residential development, and history.  <emph render="italic">New Brooklyn</emph> later shifted its focus to Staten Island and was renamed <emph render="italic">Staten Island Magazine</emph>.</p>  </bioghist>
