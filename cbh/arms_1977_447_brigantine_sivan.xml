    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Oppressive descriptive language was remediated from the abstract note in this finding aid as part of an anti-racist descriptive language audit performed in December 2020.
The collection was rehoused and the finding aid revised by Dee Bowers in November 2023. At this time the collection was renamed to reflect that "Swan" seems to be a more accurate reading of the vessel's name as written in the document than "Sivan."</p>  </processinfo>
