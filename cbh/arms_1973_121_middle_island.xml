<p>The Middle Island legal notes are recorded in a single bound notebook and span the period 1774 to 1776. The notes are handwritten and list descriptions of legal cases, including the month and year during which the case was brought to court, the persons involved in each case, whether a plea was entered by the defendent, or whether a judgement was rendered due to the absence of a plea. The notes do not clearly indicate whether the trials documented were criminal or civil trials. The creator of the notes is unknown.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Middle Island, New York is a hamlet within the Town of Brookhaven, located in Suffolk County, Long Island. Its history dates to 1766 when the first Presbyterian church was built in the area and the village of Middle Island developd around it. Middle Island's name derives from its distinction of being located approximately halfway between Long Island Sound to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south.</p>  </bioghist>
