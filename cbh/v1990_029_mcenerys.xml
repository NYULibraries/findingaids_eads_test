He started the Brooklyn-based furniture business, McEnery's, and served as president of the company for over 40 years. McEnery was married and had seven children. Two of his sons, James and J. P. McEnery, were also associated with the business. At the time of McEnery's death, circa 1917, the business was located at 86-90 Myrtle Avenue in the present-day neighborhood of Downtown Brooklyn.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
