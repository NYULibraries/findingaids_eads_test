    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Michael Shellens was born in Belgium in 1854 and moved to the United States at a young age, becoming a ship's cabin boy in his teen years.  He developed a close relationship with Captain George Wilson while working for him as a cabin boy on the <emph render="italic">Castine</emph>, and from that beginning Shellens became a steward for two voyages, one from April 1, 1872 to July 3, 1873 that journeyed to Calcutta via Boston and New Orleans, and one from July 14, 1873 to February 3, 1875 that journeyed to England and the East Indies. </p><p>Shellens joined Captain Wilson in 1877 as the third mate of the <emph render="italic">Daniel I. Tenney</emph> and made two consecutive voyages to Calcutta, and a later voyage to Manila. He transferred to the <emph render="italic">Susan Gilmore</emph> in late 1877 upon being promoted to second mate, and traveled from November 8, 1877 to October 15, 1878.  Upon his return in 1878, Shellens became naturalized in Portland, ME as a citizen of the United States.</p><p>Shellens joined Captain Wilson on the <emph render="italic">Daniel I. Tenney</emph> in 1880 and made two more voyages, one to Calcutta from May 16, 1880 to June 19, 1881, and another to Manila between August 21, 1881 and November 1, 1882.  He then joined the <emph render="italic">Lizzie H</emph> on November 6, 1882 as first mate. He joined the <emph render="italic">Agenor</emph> in August 1887 and became its captain in 1892.  Shellens made a number of voyages aboard the <emph render="italic">Agenor</emph>, including trips to San Francisco, Hong Kong, England, and Australia.</p><p>The <emph render="italic">Agenor</emph> collided on June 1, 1895 with an Italian ship, the <emph render="italic">Giovanni</emph>, off Cape San Antonio in the Mediterranean Sea.  The <emph render="italic">Giovanni</emph> sank but all of its crew survived, and Captain Shellens, to considerable acclaim, rescued and fed the Italian crew, and dropped the men off in Gibraltar.  More acclaim came for Shellens in 1897 when he piloted the <emph render="italic">Agenor</emph> to victory in a race against the <emph render="italic">Lucille</emph> from New York to the port of Melbourne. Shellens made his last voyage to Hong Kong and then retired from the <emph render="italic">Agenor</emph> in 1898.  The <emph render="italic">Agenor</emph> was lost off the coast of Japan in 1906 under another captain.</p><p>Shellens married Ella Mabel Collamore (d. 1944) in Brooklyn in 1899 and lived with her at 291 24th Street in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.  The couple moved in that same year to 342 52nd Street in Sunset Park upon the birth of their first child, Marie, who died at the age of 11 months.  The Shellens had three more children: Marshall (b. 1903), Ruth (1905-1987), and Hazel (b. 1909).  Shellens became active in various social and professional organizations, including the Royal Arch Masons, Masons of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Marine Society of New York.</p><p>Shellens made several unsuccessful attempts to find suitable opportunities in seafaring from 1899 through 1902, due reportedly to his lack of experience with steamer vessels. He then became a marine surveyor and at the same time began to acquire property in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn.  His real estate venture became notably successful and in 1905 he bought a block of 25 lots in Bay Ridge, from whence his substantial estate derived.</p><p>Shellens died on April 22, 1944, just a month after the death of his wife, and he left his personal and business papers to his daughter, Ruth Shellens, along with his property at 371 73rd Street in Bay Ridge, where she resided until her death in 1987.  Upon her passing, Ms. Shellens bequeathed this collection, along with a substantial monetary sum, to the Brooklyn Historical Society.  The monetary portion of her donation was subsequently used toward the renovation of the Society's first floor gallery space, which is now named the Shellens Gallery in honor of the Shellens family's generosity.</p>  </bioghist>

Business papers pertain to Michael Shellens's careers in seafaring and real estate, and personal papers pertain to the private affairs of the Shellens family.  The books are from the personal collections of members of the Shellens family.   </p><p>Business papers include discharge documents received at destination ports, business and financial records, accounts and service agreements, calculation and log books, bills, and correspondence compiled during Shellens's many sailing trips.  There are also newspaper clippings on the sea race between the <emph render="italic">Agenor</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Lucille</emph> and the accident between the <emph render="italic">Agenor</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Giovanni</emph> in the Mediterranean Sea. Materials pertaining to Shellens's careers in real estate and surveying include inventories of properties of interest to Shellens, professional certifications, survey reports, and correspondence from colleagues and tenants. Financial records include bank accounts, ledger books, and real estate transactions.</p><p>Personal papers consist mainly of correspondence, most of which pertains chiefly to Michael Shellens, though there are also letters concerning other members of his immediate family and members of the Shellens family in Antwerp.  The correspondence includes letters between Shellens and his daughter Ruth from her childhood to womanhood, and letters from Shellens's mentor and friend Captain George Wilson, as well as letters between Shellens and other colleagues and friends.  Other correspondence pertains to Shellens's brother, M. Henry Shellens, and his cousins in Antwerp.  These letters refer to the well-being of family members, requests for funds, Shellens's mother's death, and Shellens's own ill health in the 1940s.  Correspondence of Shellens's wife, Ella (Collamore) Shellens, including a letter of condolence from Captain Wilson's wife after the death of the Shellens' first child, Marie, is also present here. Other personal papers include materials related to the wedding of Michael and Ella Shellens, birth records for Ruth Shellens, obituaries of family members, employment letters, certificates, property ownership papers, professional and social affiliation materials, and materials relating to Michael and Ella Shellens's marriage and deaths, such as a wedding announcement, funeral memoirs, wills, bank balances, real estate holdings, and certificates. Included with wedding announcement are geneological notes about the geneology of Ella Mabel Shellens (nee Collamore).  </p><p>The last portion of this series consists of books on seafaring and religion. While most books are from Michael Shellens's personal collection, there is also one book that formerly belonged to Ella Shellens, and a Masonic Lodge Bible that belonged to Marshall Shellens.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref14_xwv" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 2: Photographs</unittitle><unitid>V1988.468</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">0.42 Linear Feet</extent><extent altrender="carrier">in one manuscript box and one oversize box.</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1865-1970</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d27bf712861d620f1a89827509e8dc06"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series is contained in Manuscript Box 5 and Oversize Box 1 and consists of over one hundred photographs of members of the Shellens family.
