    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Bayside is a neighborhood in northeastern Queens named for its proximity to Little Neck Bay. It was first inhabited by the Matinecock people. Its first European settler was Quaker John Rodman during the American Revolution. Thomas Hicks and the Lawrence family settled in the area in the 1820s, and the community expanded after the North Shore Railroad was expanded in 1866.</p>    <list type="ordered">
