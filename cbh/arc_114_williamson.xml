    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection, spanning 1687 to 1953, contains 11 items pertaining to the William Williamson family of Gravesend, N.Y. Photostat items include an oath of allegiance to Britain for William Williamson, dated 1687, and military orders, a military appointment, and an oath of allegiance for Rem Williamson, all of which date from the Revolutionary War period. Rem Williamson's military orders were signed by Colonel R. Van Brunt. The remaining portion of the collection consists of loose pages from a family bible listing birth, marriage, and death dates of members of the Williamson family (in particular, descendents of Rem Williamson) which may be of interest to genealogists. The last entry is of Marietta C. Hill, who lived in Windham, N.Y. and was buried in 1953 at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.</p>  </scopecontent>
