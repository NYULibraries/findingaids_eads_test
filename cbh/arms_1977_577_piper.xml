    <abstract id="aspace_96b41b23adf561af2928798d2c36a07f">This collection consists of papers of Jean Piper relating to the proper naming of Hunts Lane (formerly Hunts Alley).  Included is correspondence between Piper and the Brooklyn Post Office and Board of Alderman, a resolution changing the name of Hunts Alley to Hunts Lane, and an essay by Piper giving a brief history of the Hunt family farm, as well as her desire to have the street recognized as a lane instead of an alley.  Materials date from 1929.  Hunts Lane in Brooklyn, a small lane off Henry Street in the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights, was most likely named after John Hunt, who purchased land from the Pierrepont family in 1842.</abstract>
