Included is correspondence between Piper and the Brooklyn Post Office and Board of Alderman, a resolution changing the name of Hunts Alley to Hunts Lane, and an essay by Piper giving a brief history of the Hunt family farm, as well as her desire to have the street recognized as a lane instead of an alley.  Materials date from 1929.  Hunts Lane in Brooklyn, a small lane off Henry Street in the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights, was most likely named after John Hunt, who purchased land from the Pierrepont family in 1842.</abstract>
