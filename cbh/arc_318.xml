In Brooklyn, Stanley P. Mixon was employed by the HABS project to photograph historic buildings throughout the borough in 1940.</p><p>The Wyckoff-Bennett Homestead, built in the Dutch colonial style, is located at 1669 East 22nd Street (near Kings Highway) in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. Presumably built by descendants of Pieter Wyckoff, Abraham and Henry Wyckoff, the house and barn are believed to have been completed circa 1760. In 1835, the house was purchased by Cornelius W. Bennett. As of 2011, his descendants continue to occupy the house. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977. In Brooklyn, Dutch colonial houses were built by early Dutch settlers, and their descendants, to resemble the architecture of the Netherlands. Dutch colonial houses in Brooklyn are identifiable by their gambrel roofs (typically a symmetrical two-sided roof consisting of two slopes), curved projecting eaves, end chimneys, shingled siding, and south facing entrances.</p><p>Erasmus Hall Academy was established in 1787 as a private, all-male academy in what is the present-day neighborhood of Flatbush. Erasmus Hall, the original wooden Federal style building, was completed in 1787. Today, the building is located at the center of the quadrangle that comprises Erasmus Hall High School. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.</p><p>The Old Stone House, also referred to as the Vechte-Cortelyou House, was built by Nicholas Vechte in 1699. Originally located along Gowanus Creek, the house became a battle site during the American Revolutionary War. In 1797, the house was sold to the Cortelyou family, but by the 1890s it had been demolished. The site where the house stood was rediscovered in the 1930s and original stones that were recovered from an excavation of the site were used to rebuild a replica of the house. As of 2011, the house serves as an historic interpretive center, operated by First Battle Revival Alliance, and is located in Washington Park within the borders of the Park Slope and Gowanus neighborhoods of Brooklyn.</p><p>The Sands Mansion was located at 31 Front Street in what is the present-day Brooklyn neighborhood of DUMBO. The mansion was built by Joshua Sands, a merchant and politician. The three-story Federal style mansion was the largest mansion in Brooklyn when it was completed in 1787. Ann Sands, his wife, is accredited as being a founding member of St. Ann's Church (originally known as The Episcopal Church of Brooklyn), the oldest Episcopal parish in Brooklyn and incorporated in 1787. Ann Sands hosted weekly church gatherings in the mansion for many years.</p><p>Sources:

The photographer, Stanley P. Mixon, was employed by the HABS project to document historic buildings throughout the United States. This collection documents four buildings located in Brooklyn, N.Y.: the Wyckoff-Bennett Homestead (1760), Erasmus Hall (1787), the Old Stone House (also known at the Vechte-Cortelyou House; 1699), and the Sands Mansion (1787). All photographs were taken within a two-day period, on either March 18, 1940 or March 19, 1940. Photographs of exterior views, interior views, and detail views are included in the collection. The prints are 5 x 7, though the collection contains one 7.5 x 10 print of Erasmus Hall, photographed by George B. Brainard. This photograph was not created as part of the HABS project.</p></scopecontent><acqinfo id="aspace_9eae86eac1e6e686aa955546f2293651"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>Source and date of acquisition for this collection are unknown.

During the Civil War, the Navy Yard employed about 6,000 people. By 1938, it provided jobs for over 10,000 people. The Navy Yard was decommissioned in 1966 and sold to the City of New York. The Naval Hospital Annex section remained under the juristiction of the U.S. Navy until 2003, which the Annex was transferred to the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation.</p><p>The Brooklyn Navy Yard was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

The refinery has its origins with the Havemeyer family, which first started baking sugar in New York City around 1805, and was very influential in the establishment and consolidation of sugar production in the United States. The Brooklyn site was established in the mid-1850s. The plant operated for the next 150 years under the auspicies of many different companies, including Havemayer and Elder, Sugar Refineries Company, American Sugar Refining Company, Amstar Sugar Company, Tate and Lyle, Domino Sugar Corporation, and Florida Crystals Corporation. The Brooklyn refinery plant officially closed in 2004, and the site was sold in 2005 to the developer Community Preservation Corporation Resources (CPCR) and rezoned for residential use. CPCR sold the site to Two Trees Management Company in 2012.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_014b33e10b120fd838d74fd994703e67"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of one Historic American Engineering Record documentation for the American Sugar Refining Company, Brooklyn Refinery.

The church was constructed in 1919 and dedicated the following year, the Sunday School building was not constructed until 1925. The Baptist Church of the Redeemer began as the Baptist Society of Flatbush in 1899, and the congregation grew quickly. The land on which the current church stands was gifted to the congregation in 1918 by Elmer Am Sperry, a wealthy inventor. Demographic changes in Flatbush led to significant shifts in the congregation, and the church began to cater to a larger immigrant community in the second half of the twentieth century, offering services in Spanish, and Chinese, Haitian-French. However, the size of the congregation continued to shrink and the church fell into dispair. The church entered into an agreement with MHANY to constructive afforable housing and a new church space, allowing the congregation to remain at the same location while also creating new affordable housing.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_2162697d5361ebd4b6e407f6bd3dd4f2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series includes one Historic American Buildings Survey on the Baptist Church of the Redeemer, including one research summary, copies of the original 1918 blueprints, blueprints and floorplans for alterations in 1942 and 1975, historic photographs of the church in use, a copy of the 85th anniversary commemoration booklet, and supplementary photographs of the stained glass windows.</p></scopecontent><acqinfo id="aspace_858075fd1517b9ed2aa1e4d1bdc53279"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>Donated by Claudia Cooney on behlaf of AKRF, Inc. in 2019.</p></acqinfo><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Baptists |z New York (State) |z Kings County</subject><subject source="lcsh">Churches -- New York (State) -- New York</subject><subject source="lcsh">African American churches -- New York (State) -- New York</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Flatbush (New York, N.Y.)</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Historic preservation |z New York (State) |z Kings County</subject></controlaccess></c></dsc>
