The collection contains a broad range of documents covering the variety of the Congregation's work and operations including its official minutes and trustee records, financial records, ministers files, sermons, photographs, calendars, celebration programs and registers, and building records that include deeds, leases, and building plans for the Church of the Saviour and other buildings owned by the First Church. The community and charity work of the Church is represented as well through ledgers, correspondence, notes and reports by the various clubs and committees and through similar documentation from the Church's Willow Place Chapel where the Church's settlement and welfare programs and Sunday school operated. The Church was also involved with local and international relief and aid groups, particularly during the tenure of Minister John H. Lathrop. Lathrop's files include correspondence, minutes of committees, and other documents from his work with a variety of local and worldwide religious and humanitarian groups. Lathrop also collected a variety of reference materials, including pamphlets, flyers, and articles pertaining to peace, liberalism, theology, and family planning. Other major figures of the First Church and Brooklyn history represented by the collection include the Low family and Alfred T. White. 

The collection also holds scrapbooks with relevant collected clippings that were donated by parishioners and photographs of some church members and activities. The Second and Third Unitarian Congregations are both represented within this collection as well. These two congregations split from the First Congregation at different points in the 19th century and both re-united with the First Congregation in the mid-1920s.</abstract>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The First Unitarian Congregational Society records were found roughly organized with some preliminary work done by an unknown archivist. Some documents within the collection hinted at an original order similar to the arrangement that the collection was found in and the arrangement of the collection is relatively faithful to this original order.</p><p>The files within most series are arranged alphabetically according to description with some exceptions such as the <emph render="bold">Ministers</emph> series, arranged chronologically by tenure of ministers and the <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph> series, arranged according to a BHS-assigned identification number, or "V #"</p><p>Users of the collection should be aware that it is likely that documents on some matters will be found in
various series, and in various folders within series. For example, while registers of church deaths, marriages, and christenings should be primarily located in the <emph render="bold">Registers</emph> series, more lists of this nature can be seen in the <emph render="bold">Trustee Records</emph> or the files on different ministers. Similarly, the work of the Sunday School can be found in the <emph render="bold">Sunday School Books</emph> series, but also in the <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> and <emph render="bold">Willow Place Chapel and Columbia House</emph> series.</p><p>Folders labeled with a date range might also include undated documents. Also, the date range was determined by the archivist based on a broad survey of folder contents and not on an item level review; accordingly, there may be items in the folders that fall outside the indicated range. Users of the collection should also be aware that some oversized items have been moved to four oversize containers. Notes have been made in these instances both in the folders from which the material was removed and in the container list in this finding aid.</p><p>The collection is organized into the following fifteen series:</p>    <list type="ordered">

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The First Unitarian Congregational Society of Brooklyn records contain the records created and collected by the First Church over the course of its work and operations. This includes the basic functions of the church as a religious congregation and also the work of the members of its congregation, through various clubs, committees and organizations, contributing to service locally, nationally, and abroad.</p><p>The contents of the collection span from 1790 to 1972 though the bulk of the materials begins from the point of the First Church's organization in 1833 and extends to the late 1960's. The organizational records of the First Church are well represented including meeting minutes and resolutions of the Trustees and the Society, by-laws, calendars, directories, registers, and reports of the ministers and various clubs and committees. Documents related to the First Church's founding and its early operation were kept in "History" files among its Subject Files. Subject Files also include information on bequests to the church, church memorials, and church celebrations.</p><p>Financial records include various reports and ledgers related to the First Church's endowment, income, expenses, fund raising, and budgets. This also includes subscriber and pew rental information and information on the First Church's properties including mortgages and leases. Other documents on the First Church's properties and buildings include blueprints, deeds, alterations and repairs, and information on stained glass windows and other decorations.</p><p>The work of the First Church's ministers is collected here through sermons, correspondence, and collected articles and items in reference to them. The files of Minister John H. Lathrop contain not only a variety of sermons and orders of service, but also records on his work for the community and in international matters. Lathrop headed or worked closely with groups like the Brooklyn Urban League and the National Peace Conference and his files hold correspondence, meeting minutes, and other materials related to these groups. Lathrop was heavily involved in international relief and aid and in addition to correspondence and other documents regarding organizations of this nature, Lathrop's personal work with international aid and Unitarianism, particularly in Transylvania and Czechoslovakia, is among his files here. The Lathrop papers also contain many articles, pamphlets, and other materials related to his areas of interest including marriage, peace, labor and unemployment, religious freedom, and liberal Christianity. The records of the First Church and its ministers also provide some insight into the evolution of Unitarianism in Brooklyn, America, and other parts of the world, particularly through the American Unitarian Association and its departments of outreach, publicity, and social-service. Many sermons and articles by the ministers, particularly John White Chadwick, John Lathrop, and Samuel Longfellow, discuss theology and the development of liberal Christianity as it pertains to Unitarianism.</p><p>The First Church's settlement and community work is represented through Sunday School records, club work, charity records, and files on outside community organizations like the Boys' Club and the Brooklyn Bureau of Charities. Much of the settlement and community work of the church was carried out through the Furman Street Mission, Willow Place Chapel, and Columbia House.</p><p>The collection also contains photographs of church buildings and functions, and a collection of scrapbooks with clippings related to the First Church's history, particularly some of its ministers.</p><p>The collection holds similar records of ecumenical, organizational and community work as they pertain to Second and Third Unitarian Congregational Societies of Brooklyn as well. The correspondence of ministers and trustees, reports, and other documents regarding the creation of these two congregations and their eventual re-unification with the First Church are among the records of all three congregations.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In June 1833, forced between choosing a ferry ride to Unitarian services in Manhattan or attending services of a different denomination in Brooklyn where they would be refused communion, a group of ten men (John Frost, Josiah Dow, George Blackburn, William H. Carey, William H. Hale, Henry Leeds, Seth Low, Alexander H. Smith, and Charles and Thomas Woodward) set to forming a Unitarian society in Brooklyn. The First Unitarian Congregational Society of Brooklyn was incorporated two years later as the thirteenth functioning church in Brooklyn and the first in the city to be controlled by its congregation. As its place of worship the First Church constructed the Church Of The Saviour on Pierrepont Street by Monroe Place in 1844. The building was designed by architect Minard Lefever in the Gothic Revival style. </p><p>The First Church operated a settlement school and Sunday school out of the chapel adjacent to the Church of the Saviour and through the Furman Street Mission until 1876 when, under the guidance of settlement teacher and community figure Alfred T. White, the Congregation completed Willow Place Chapel on Willow Place near Joralemon Street. Willow Place Chapel functioned as a space for evening church services and as a site for much of the First Church's social service and community outreach, particularly through club work. With the help of figures like Alfred T. White and Minister H. Price Collier, settlement and community work at Willow Place Chapel expanded until the First Church had to build an extension of the facilities in 1906 called Columbia House.</p><p>In 1840 twenty-two of the First Church parishioners, finding dissatisfaction in particular with Frederick Holland as minister, gathered to form a second society. Holland attempted to resign in 1841 but this resignation was rejected and the two congregations would not reunite until after Holland's second (and this time accepted) resignation in 1842. In 1851 fifty families seeking a more liberal theology would again leave the First Church. Legally organized in 1852, the second iteration of the Second Unitarian Congregation of Brooklyn installed Samuel Longfellow as its first minister in 1853. Longfellow fit the progressive nature of the congregation and not only preached a liberal theology, but also covered a variety of topics from the pulpit including the abolition of American slavery. Longfellow even gave one infamous sermon eulogizing and praising John Brown and his attempt to incite insurrection at Harper's Ferry. Longfellow resigned in 1860 and was succeeded by Reverend Nahor A. Staples, another liberal voice with some abolitionist views. John White Chadwick was another prominent minister of the congregation who became influential within Unitarianism and liberal theology. The Second Congregation sold its church and reunited with the First Church in 1924.</p><p>Another split from the First Church came in 1867 when, in order to accommodate parishioners of the First Unitarian Congregation who had been travelling from the Fort Greene and Clinton Hill neighborhoods, the Third Unitarian Congregational Society of Brooklyn was established. First Church minister Frederick A. Farley assisted in duties as a minister until the Third Congregation installed Stephen H. Camp as minister in 1869. Camp became the Third Congregation's most prominent minister and in addition to encouraging organized charitable works and teaching within the Congregation's Sunday School he also shepherded the Congregation from their first space in Unity Chapel (built in 1868 with the assistance of the First Congregation) to Unity Church (built in 1886). The Third Congregation sold its church and reunited with the First Congregation in 1925.</p><p>
In the time that these three Unitarian congregations were separate from each other, the First Church became more involved in the growing Unitarian movement. Samuel A. Eliot was installed as minister of the Church in 1893 and a year later began serving on the board of directors for the American Unitarian Association (AUA). From this position Eliot helped change the management model of the AUA making it a more effective organization connecting the congregational and secular work of Unitarians. After leaving the First Church's pulpit in 1897, Eliot would go on to become AUA Secretary and then, in 1900, the first president of the AUA to be given executive power over the organization.</p><p>The First Church's involvement in national and international concerns grew further under the guidance of Minister John Howland Lathrop. Installed in 1911, Lathrop's tenure as minister spanned the period of both World Wars and he was active in advocating for peace not only during the wars, but also in regards to conflicts which occurred following each war particularly in Spain, China, Palestine, and Eastern Europe. Lathrop wrote many sermons and articles advocating for peace and international relief efforts and was involved with many like-minded organizations, including the National Peace Conference which he served as president. Lathrop also concerned himself with international ecumenical issues and kept up contact with churches in England, the Philippines, Mexico, Japan and Eastern Europe. Lathrop turned particular attention to the growth of Unitarianism in Transylvania and in his congregation's connection to Czechoslovakia. Lathrop kept up correspondence with the Masaryk family, a major political family in Czechoslovakia. In particular he communicated with social worker and president of the Czechoslovak Red Cross Alice Garrigue Masaryk. Alice was the daughter of Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia, and Charlotte Garrigue, a former member of the First Unitarian Congregation of Brooklyn. Lathrop was an important member of the Unitarian Service Committee trip to Czechoslovakia in 1946. Lathrop's focus was not exclusively international, of course, as he was focused on local issues particularly in regards to urban conditions, employment, housing, and education. In addition to growing the breadth of services provided by the First Church, like social psychiatric counseling for parishioners, Lathrop was heavily involved with groups outside the walls of the church that contributed to the community like the Civic Committee for Adult Literacy and the Brooklyn Urban League which he served as president for many years. Lathrop's prolific and important service to his congregation, community and the world went on even after his retirement in 1957, visiting the First Church yearly until his last visit in 1965, two years prior to his death.</p><p>The First Unitarian Congregational Society of Brooklyn continues to operate out of the Church of the Saviour in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood.</p>  </bioghist>

These files include correspondence between the founders, resolutions and other actions of Trustees, early lists of subscribers, By-Laws, and early bills and accounts. The documents address the incorporation of the Congregation, the acquisition of land and the building of the Church of the Saviour, ministers, music, and other major matters of the congregation. Documents related to the early formation of the 2nd Congregation can also be found among these "History" folders. Some other documents related to the early and foundational years of the church can be found in the folders on By-Laws, Covenants and Statements of Faith, and Special Services. Also of interest are documents on the Church's work with children and youth including various clubs and very early documents regarding the Church's Sunday School. There is also club work here regarding psychiatric social work and counseling made available to parishioners during the tenure of John H. Lathrop. Researchers interested in the Low family should also note one file regarding the family with documents mostly unrelated to the church dating back to 1790.</p><p><emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> also holds published directories of the Church which have Parish lists, club reports with member rolls, updated by-laws and other information on the Church. Some of these directories have been annotated, particularly in the Parish membership lists. Other family-oriented documents include the Bequests, Memorials, Special Services, and membership files.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref25_vh9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bequests:

The materials are primarily correspondence and copies of resolutions and votes of the Society on these matters. Some files also include sermons, relevant news clippings, and articles . The file on Frederick W. Holland has correspondence regarding protest and controversy over his leadership during a developing schism in the Church as well as his record of funerals, baptisms, and marriages in the Church during his tenure. Clippings and Orders of Service related to Alfred E. Goodnough, H. Price Collier, and Samuel A. Eliot can be found in the <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks</emph> series. Additional sermons by H. Price Collier can also be found in the <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks</emph> series.</p><p>In the case of John Lathrop there are several folders due to the bulk of material. These are broken up by subject including his installation, committees he was involved with, other churches he communicated with, and memorial services after his death. Some of the committees here include the the League of Nations Association, the Long Island Historical Society, the Religious Arts Guild, refugee aid associations and other organizations dealing with ecumenical issues, the peace movement, and welfare and aid to the needy. While these files relate to what the Church kept in regards to Lathrop, for documents related to Lathrop's work, including his sermons, see the <emph render="bold">John H.

Lathrop Files</emph> series contains the working and reference files of John H. Lathrop who served as minister to the First Unitarian Congregation of Brooklyn from 1911 to 1967. The series covers Lathrop's varied interests and prolific work. Lathrop's work within the Church and community can be seen through his sermons, correspondence, parishioners' files, and work with organizations like the Brooklyn Urban League which he helped found and managed as president for many years. As minister for the Church during both world wars, Lathrop was interested in the international peace movement. Lathrop was involved with various organizations which mobilized for peace like the War Resisters League, the Emergency Peace Campaign, and the National Peace Conference, which he headed. Lathrop was similarly interested in international aid and outreach and had files pertaining to humanitarian efforts in Germany, Spain, Hungary and other nations.</p><p>There are some records within this series regarding the First Church's connection to Unitarians in Transylvania and their church there. Several files also address Czechoslovakia and the Unitarian Service Committee trip there which Lathrop was a part of. The First Unitarian Congregation of Brooklyn had a special connection to Czechoslovakia as a former member of the Church, Charlotte Garrigue, had married the first president of Czechoslovakia, Tomas Garrigue Masaryk. Lathrop kept up correspondence with their daughter, Alice Garrigue Masaryk, one of the founders of the Czechoslovak Red Cross, and their son, Jan Masaryk, the Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia.</p><p>The series also contains a collection of reference material on various topics of interest to Lathrop including marriage, peace, labor and unemployment, religious freedom, liberal Christianity, and other related issues. These reference files consist of articles, pamphlets, and various materials from organizations Lathrop was interested in or with which he was tangentially involved. Lathrop's sermons deal with this broad range of topics as well, particularly ideas of liberal Christianity and its application in the world. Lathrop's work with like-minded organizations like the International Association for Liberal Christianity and Religious Freedom and the American Committee on Religious Rights and Minorities can be found in this series.</p><p>Some files on Lathrop and documents created by him can be found in many other series within the collection, but particularly within the <emph render="bold">Ministers</emph> series which contains documents on his installation, organizations he served on the board of, and memorial services for his death.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref140_xhs" level="file"><did><unittitle>Altar of All Faiths: Brahmo Samaj plaque, artist's sketch</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1911/1960" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_11008053d08388a4cd73e20274cc060e" label="Text [14265000011232]" type="Box">22</container><container parent="aspace_11008053d08388a4cd73e20274cc060e" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref355_tpi" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Committee on Religious Rights and Minorities</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1928/1951" type="inclusive">1928-1944, 1951</unitdate><container id="aspace_cdf3dca346bb783da8b6eceeb2cb302e" label="Text [14265000011232]" type="Box">22</container><container parent="aspace_cdf3dca346bb783da8b6eceeb2cb302e" type="Folder">2-5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref141_z1x" level="file"><did><unittitle>American League for Human Rights</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1933/1933" type="inclusive">1933</unitdate><container id="aspace_b833788ade0fbd6d163b6df1976c26e2" label="Text [14265000011232]" type="Box">22</container><container parent="aspace_b833788ade0fbd6d163b6df1976c26e2" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref142_cc8" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Legion</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1934/1934" type="inclusive">1934</unitdate><container id="aspace_db664e99af0106a045257c1e84487d16" label="Text [14265000011232]" type="Box">22</container><container parent="aspace_db664e99af0106a045257c1e84487d16" type="Folder">7</container></did><odd id="aspace_e857612726bcca3fba275882127b1754"><head>General</head><p>Includes signed letter from U.S. Senator Royal S.

and Contents</head><p>Willow Place Chapel was built in 1876 under the direction of Alfred T. White who was seeking a more proper setting for the settlement school under his charge. The Chapel functioned somewhat separately from the Church of the Saviour and conducted its own evening services as well as adopting the First Congregation's Sunday School. In addition to these tasks, some other classes (such as in music or sewing), clubs, and welfare work operated out of Willow Place Chapel. In 1906 Columbia House was added to the settlement complex and carried on its own outreach and community work in conjunction with Willow Place Chapel. The <emph render="bold">Willow Place Chapel and Columbia House</emph> series contains the records related to the work carried on within these buildings and on behalf of the members including annual and trustee reports, deacon meeting minutes, Sunday school records, and the records of the Chapel Association. The series also holds relevant building records in regards to construction and alterations, financial information including accounts and salaries, various records on clubs and events that functioned out of the Chapel, and records related to health and social work carried out by the Chapel's staff. Prior to the establishment of Willow Place Chapel these tasks, particularly social and settlement work, were done at the Furman Street Mission. Reports and other records relevant to work done at the Furman Street Mission can be found in this series, particularly among material before 1876.</p><p>For more on the Congregation's Sunday school, see the series <emph render="bold">Sunday School Books</emph>. For registers pertaining to services and members of the Willow Place Chapel, see the <emph render="bold">Registers</emph> series. Some financial records of the Sunday School can be found in the <emph render="bold">Financial Records</emph> series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref400_pgi" level="file"><did><unittitle>50th Anniversary</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1915/1915" type="inclusive">1915</unitdate><container id="aspace_20e3b3ef782209851c70dd38822b253b" label="Text [14265000011620]" type="Box">63</container><container parent="aspace_20e3b3ef782209851c70dd38822b253b" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref401_cg1" level="file"><did><unittitle>97th Company</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1890/1892" type="inclusive">1890-1892</unitdate><container id="aspace_54d968bb6b2bb556d195a83bff1f7260" label="Text [14265000011620]" type="Box">63</container><container parent="aspace_54d968bb6b2bb556d195a83bff1f7260" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref403_7n9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Accounts Ledger</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1906/1920" type="inclusive">1906-1920</unitdate><container id="aspace_132c063b8135734258750545c4ff01f1" label="Text [14265000011620]" type="Box">63</container><container parent="aspace_132c063b8135734258750545c4ff01f1" type="Folder">3-4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref404_h5q" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alfred T.

holds many of the Church's records regarding collecting and disbursing funds for its operations as well as for Willow Place Chapel, the Sunday School, Missionary Fund, and other programs. General financial statements of the Congregation are within this series. The series includes records of disbursements from the Charity Fund, Friendship Fund, and Minister's Discretionary Fund (the Charity Fund was used to make payments to congregants in need until 1923 when it was replaced by the Friendship Fund. The Friendship Fund was closed in 1940 and its purpose subsumed into the Minister's Discretionary Fund, which was also used for such payments prior to 1940.) In addition to the records of the Treasurer, budgets, investments, and fund raising, this series also contains ledgers on subscriber dues and pew rentals, including a book of the original deeds to the pews. Records on the receipts of the Church and ledgers of Offerings to the Church are another source of lists of pews renters and subscribers. The Church's investments include mortgages, so there is some information on individual residential mortgages including amounts, debtors, and properties.</p><p>The Housekeeping Scribe's Chronicle is a record of expenses for club meetings and events and thus doubles as a resource of menus and club member rolls.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref529_qcq" level="file"><did><unittitle>Appraisal of

The scrapbooks collect articles on the church's ministers and on religious and ecumenical matters. They also collect some published images, poems, hymns, and local news items. Several of the scrapbooks include clippings related to Plymouth Church and Henry Ward Beecher. Most of the scrapbooks seem to have been made by members of the church. The scrapbooks of items on the ministers Alfred E. Goodnough, H. Price Collier, and Samuel A. Eliot and the scrapbooks collecting the sermons of Collier were assembled and donated to the church by Maud Willard Bartlett. One other scrapbook ("Religion and Theology, 1866-1875") included a note that it came from the home of Mary E. Butterick in 1942.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref581_163" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ministers: A. E.

Most of the folders in this series contain images that were originally part of the First Unitarian Congregational Society records. These photos were initially removed from the collection and entered into the library's image database under a V1989.20 accession number. The photos include church buildings, like Willow Place Chapel and the Third Unitarian Congregation's Unity Church, and church activities such as a picnic, fairs, plays, and some minstrel shows. Also included are photos of ministers from the First, Second, and Third Unitarian Congregations including John Lathrop, John White Chadwick, Alfred P. Putnam and Stephen H. Camp. The last folder in the series contains photos from a later accession, V1990.46, and consists of four print reproductions of photographs of Willow Place Chapel, Columbia House, and the school at the chapel.</p><p>Item level description and digital versions of images from the collection are available for searching via the image database in the library.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref594_0wv"

Fredrick Holland. The congregations united in 1842 (after Holland's resignation) but split again in 1851. The <emph render="bold">Second Unitarian Congregation</emph> series represents the records of the Second Unitarian Congregation during both of these splits. </p><p>The Congregation's first permanent minister was Samuel Longfellow, installed in 1853. The Second Unitarian Congregation took a progressive stance under Longfellow who occasionally preached against slavery and delivered an infamous sermon in praise of John Brown. Some of Longfellow's sermons can be found in the file on him. A parishioner's complaint and resignation of his pew in reaction to Longfellow's John Brown sermon can be found in the "Finances: Pew Rentals" folder. Longfellow's tenure was followed by Nahor A. Staples who also included abolitionist views in his sermons. The Second Congregation's influential minister John White Chadwick (installed 1864) is also well represented in this series through his correspondence, sermons and articles written by and about him, particularly memorials after his death.</p><p>The series contains records related to the regular functions and activities of the Second Congregation including trustee records, financial records of pew renters and subscribers, committee reports and record books kept by the Sunday School. The series also contains many records of the Second Congregation's Branch Alliance, a women's group that did charity work and eventually folded into the First Congregation's Samaritan Alliance when the Congregations reunited in 1924.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref608_wry" level="file"><did><unittitle>Address Book</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1860/1890"

Frederick A. Farley assisted in duties as a minister until the Third Congregation installed Stephen H. Camp as minister in 1869. Camp became the Third Congregation's most prominent minister and in addition to encouraging organized charitable works and teaching within the Congregation's Sunday School he also shepherded the Congregation from their first space in Unity Chapel (built in 1868 with the assistance of the First Congregation) to Unity Church (built in 1886). The Third Congregation sold its church and united with the First Congregation in 1925.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Third Unitarian Congregation</emph> series contains the records of the Third Congregation's organization and operation including its by-laws, society and trustee minutes, resolutions, and financial records. The series also contains records of the Congregation's charitable work such as through the Branch Alliance, the Charitable Fund, the Ladies Benevolent and Social Society, and other clubs and groups organized by the Church. Correspondence regarding the merger of the Third Congregation's merger with the First Congregation can also be found here.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref673_4p1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Accounts Book</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1871/1877" type="inclusive">1871-1877</unitdate><container id="aspace_4e1fb7f2e5cd640ae956ef06fbce6893" label="Text [14265000014749]" type="Box">108</container><container parent="aspace_4e1fb7f2e5cd640ae956ef06fbce6893" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref674_kmj" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual Meeting Minutes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1889/1936" type="inclusive">1889-1910, 1919-1931, 1936</unitdate><container id="aspace_723648e182a53628d7fe00505f60608b" label="Text [14265000014749]" type="Box">108</container><container parent="aspace_723648e182a53628d7fe00505f60608b" type="Folder">2-3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref675_r1g" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bequests</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1927/1939" type="inclusive">1927, 1934, 1939</unitdate><container id="aspace_e2b389b0c0a5a31ac831fea90a33935e" label="Text [14265000014749]" type="Box">108</container><container parent="aspace_e2b389b0c0a5a31ac831fea90a33935e" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref676_whr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Branch Alliance</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1909/1935" type="inclusive">1909-1935</unitdate><container id="aspace_374614b9f01c07bb1eced899b4cb39de" label="Text [14265000014749]" type="Box">108</container><container parent="aspace_374614b9f01c07bb1eced899b4cb39de" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref677_bcm" level="file"><did><unittitle>Branch Alliance: Accounts Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1897/1934" type="inclusive">1897-1910, 1917-1934</unitdate><container id="aspace_28252135ae8341dce2e4563a5ca0ce71" label="Text [14265000014749]" type="Box">108</container><container parent="aspace_28252135ae8341dce2e4563a5ca0ce71" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref678_acc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Branch Alliance: Meeting Minutes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1897/1906" type="inclusive">1897-1898, 1905-1906</unitdate><container id="aspace_e1c103042838c6f47298ca3590b0bb3c" label="Text [14265000014749]" type="Box">108</container><container parent="aspace_e1c103042838c6f47298ca3590b0bb3c" type="Folder">7-8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref679_m3y" level="file"><did><unittitle>Branch Alliance: Meeting Minutes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1911/1917" type="inclusive">1911-1917</unitdate><container id="aspace_25666e8edc0916aeb2978d137bccecad" label="Text [14265000011976]" type="Box">109</container><container parent="aspace_25666e8edc0916aeb2978d137bccecad" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref680_9ga" level="file"><did><unittitle>Branch Alliance: Reports</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1920/1934" type="inclusive">1920-1934</unitdate><container id="aspace_0bebad53ae2f6a70a85263dbbf4ab17b" label="Text [14265000011976]" type="Box">109</container><container parent="aspace_0bebad53ae2f6a70a85263dbbf4ab17b" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref681_w4x" level="file"><did><unittitle>Branch Alliance: Reports Book</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1920/1934" type="inclusive">1920-1934</unitdate><container id="aspace_b0616e00c976533c1a217aa282af784b" label="Text [14265000011976]" type="Box">109</container><container parent="aspace_b0616e00c976533c1a217aa282af784b" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref682_oiz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Branch Alliance: Treasurer's Record Book</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1909/1918" type="inclusive">1909-1918</unitdate><container id="aspace_dc836e0aabf8a585ff27c02c0f63bec2" label="Text [14265000011976]" type="Box">109</container><container parent="aspace_dc836e0aabf8a585ff27c02c0f63bec2" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref683_eue" level="file"><did><unittitle>Branch Alliance and Friendly Aid Society: Accounts Book</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1919/1933" type="inclusive">1919-1933</unitdate><container id="aspace_a22756abd3b61d7ee4a9dc49535694c6" label="Text [14265000011976]" type="Box">109</container><container parent="aspace_a22756abd3b61d7ee4a9dc49535694c6" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref684_mcw" level="file"><did><unittitle>Brooklyn Broadcasting Corp.
