    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Third Kings Masonic Camp Fund (later, the Third Kings Masonic Camp and Charities Fund) provided financial support to send under-privileged city children to summer camp. The Fund was established in January 1931 by the Third Kings Masonic District, one of the Brooklyn districts of local Masonic bodies. In its first year, the Fund sent 98 children to summer camp. By its 10th anniversary, the number had grown to 281 children attending summer camp with monies raised by the Fund. </p><p>The inaugural Third Kings Masonic Camp Fund Annual Entertainment and Dance fundraiser was held in 1931. The event included speeches, entertainment, and dancing and for many years was held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Each year, the Fund would publish an event program (sometimes referred to as the Journal) listing officers and members of event committees, donors and advertisers, and all participating Masonic lodges.</p>  </bioghist>
