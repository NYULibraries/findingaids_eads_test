<p>The Bragaw family resided in Newtown in Queens County, N.Y.  Family members featured in this collection are mainly Andrew Bragaw and John R. Bragaw (1833-1897).  The Andrew Bragaw documented in the collection is believed to be the man of the same name who lived from 1755 to 1828, was married to Neeltje (Eleanor) Wiltsie, and was an active member, Deacon, and Elder at the Dutch Church in Newtown.  Catherine (1800-1858), Elizabeth (1794-1871), and Susan Bragaw (1802-1863), daughters of Andrew, are also featured in the collection.  John R. Bragaw, a farmer, was born in Flushing Bay, Newtown.  In 1864 he married Mary B. Ryerson (1835-1890) of Brooklyn in Kings County, N.Y. at the Newtown Presbyterian Church.  John and Mary had five children.  The exact familial relation between Andrew and John R. Bragaw is not known.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
