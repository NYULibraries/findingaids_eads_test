    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Harold E. Weeks diaries consist of seven diaries from the period 1925 to 1932, with a gap for the year 1928.  Each diary documents the day-to-day operations of the Electrical Systems Bureau of the Brooklyn Edison Company (BEC), as well as Weeks's professional activities as the Bureau's Coordinating Engineer.  The diaries also contain references to Weeks's private life; local, national, and international news events; public utilities; city planning and infrastructure; population estimates; the banking industry; the commodities markets; and aeronautics.</p><p>Entries and enclosures pertaining to the day-to-day operations of the BEC's Electrical Systems Bureau include logs; measurements and calculations for Brooklyn substations; trouble reports; AC/DC transmission calculations for Brooklyn circuits; projected costs; plans for changeover programs; reports of outages; references to large customer changeovers; completion schedules; and Bureau staff vacation schedules.</p><p>Other enclosures consist primarily of newspaper clippings, as well as system diagrams, blueprints, work orders, schedules, reports, memoranda, brochures and programs, statements of work, and some maps and correspondence.</p><p>Topics of interest include the merger of the BEC with Consolidated Gas of New York, and the death of Thomas Alva Edison.  The numerous Safety Council brochures included in the diaries, particularly from 1925 and 1926, are also of interest, as they document how the BEC communicated safety concerns with the Brooklyn community during the build-out of the municipal electrical infrastructure.</p>  </scopecontent>

Additionally, Weeks was a member of a number of professional organizations, including the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), the National Electric Light Association (NELA), the New York Electrical Society (NYES), and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and he regularly attended conferences hosted by these organizations.</p><p>Weeks also volunteered regularly.  As a member of the Brooklyn Safety Council, he taught safety and first aid courses at the Brooklyn Edison Company.  He also taught mapping and aviation to Boy Scouts, and served as a juror on a number of occasions.</p><p>Weeks's personal interests and hobbies, as evidenced by his diary entries and news clippings, included reading literature; playing chess and tennis; fencing; attending the opera and Boston Symphony performances in New York; and participating in the Debate Club and The Cicero Circle, among other clubs.</p><p>Weeks regularly read a number of New York and Brooklyn newspapers (e.g., <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph>, <emph render="italic">The New York Tribune</emph>, <emph render="italic">The New York Sun</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Daily News</emph>, <emph render="italic">The New York World</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Brooklyn Citizen</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Brooklyn Standard Union</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Brooklyn Daily Times</emph>), clipping stories related primarily to the following topics: major local, national and international news events; public utilities; city planning and infrastructure; population estimates; the banking industry and the commodities markets; and aeronautics.  Additionally, Weeks noted the birthdates of the Presidents and other figures in American history in his diaries.</p><p>Weeks resided at 20 Willow Street in Brooklyn, and was married to Dr. Virginia Travell Weeks, a Brooklyn pediatrician.  Mrs. Travell Weeks was the sister of Dr. Janet Davidson Travell, President John F. Kennedy's personal physician.  Mr. and Mrs. Weeks had four children: Sheldon Griswold Weeks, Dr. Willard Travell Weeks, Dr. Elinor Eastman Weeks, and Dr. Virginia D. Weeks (Mrs. Herbert van Wie Bergamini).</p><p>Harold Eastman Weeks died June 30, 1960, in Lake Placid, New York, at 74 years of age.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
