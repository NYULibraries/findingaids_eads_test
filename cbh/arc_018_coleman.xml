    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>William Roger Coleman was a longtime Brooklyn resident who lived during the 19th and 20th centuries. According to accounts of his grandson (also named William R. Coleman), the elder Coleman was brought to an orphanage on Staten Island at the age of four by a woman named Jenny Coleman, who claimed to be his mother. Coleman was raised at the orphanage until his early teens, when he was sent on an orphan train to Hutchinson, Kansas. In his mid-teens, he returned to New York and settled in Brooklyn, working as a clerk on the piers. At some point during his teenage years he had also attended Mt. Herman School in Northfield, Massachusetts for at least one year. Later, Coleman worked as a salesman of automobile parts for a firm called Aero Tire &amp; Supply Co. on the west side of Manhattan. In 1898, Coleman enlisted in the Army and fought in the Spanish-American War as a member of the Rough Riders, Private Troop H, 1st Cavalry. In the early 1900s, Coleman served as a social worker at one of the Settlement houses on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, working with Jewish gang members. It was through this capacity that he met Sophie Sekoson, his future wife, who was also Jewish. They were married after a long courtship, and Coleman converted to Judaism. They had one child, Gerald Coleman.</p>  </bioghist>
