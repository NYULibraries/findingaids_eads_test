    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The neighborhood of Park Slope was developed after Prospect Park was completed in 1873 and street railways began to serve the area. As in many parts of Brooklyn, the historic buildings in Park Slope declined during the mid-twentieth century following WWII and increased suburban development. In the 1960s, however, Park Slope was part of Brooklyn's brownstone revival movement, and in 1974 a large swath of the neighborhood was landmarked as the largest historic district in Brooklyn. The photographs in this collection were taken right before the landmark designation of the Park Slope historic district and show a markedly different streetscape than present-day Park Slope.</p>  </bioghist>
