<p>Originally from Norwich, England, Henry Townsend (d. 1695) immigrated with his brothers, John and Richard, to the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam (later New York) during the mid-17th century.  After settling in the town of Flushing on Long Island, the Townsend brothers relocated to Warwick, R.I. after political and religious altercations with New Amsterdam governor Peter Stuyvesant.  They returned to Long Island in 1656, settling in the town of Jamaica.  In 1657, Henry Townsend was arrested and imprisoned for harboring Quakers in his home.  This incident prompted him and his brothers to relocate to the Long Island town of Oyster Bay, which was out of the jurisdiction of the Dutch government of New Amsterdam.  Henry Townsend resided in Oyster Bay until his death.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
