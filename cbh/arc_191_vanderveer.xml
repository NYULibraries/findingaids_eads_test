    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Adrian Vanderveer Martense (1852-1898) was an amateur photographer who was a descendent of early Dutch settlers in Brooklyn. The Martense family were longtime residents of Flatbush, one of the original six towns of Brooklyn and today a neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn comprised of numerous smaller neighborhoods including Midwood, Ditmas Park, Fiske Terrace, Beverly Square (East and West), Prospect Park South, Caton Park, and Albemarle-Kenmore Terraces. In Flatbush, the Martense family built a homestead which included land that is now part of Green-Wood Cemetery. The Martense homestead stood for several generations until the family sold it in 1889, when Flatbush was transitioning from a farming community into an inner suburb.</p><p>For Adrian Vanderveer Martense, Flatbush became a subject for his photography. Martense documented houses, streets, and his friends and neighbors in Flatbush, as well as momentous events such as the Blizzard of 1888. Martense was a member of the Brooklyn Academy of Photography (which became the Brooklyn Camera Club in 1896) and served as its first recording secretary when it was established in 1887.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
