    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Parachute Jump was originally designed as an amusement ride for the New York World's Fair (1939-1940).  Following the close of the fair, the Parachute Jump was sold and moved to the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn, where it became part of the Steeplechase Park complex.  In 1968, the Parachute Jump was closed and Steeplechase Park was acquired by the City of New York in 1969.  The City attempted to sell the Parachute Jump in 1971, but received no bids.  Competing plans to demolish or preserve the ride arose.  In 1980, the Parachute Jump was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis called for analysis and recommendations to be prepared concerning the structural integrity, historical status, and future potential of the Parachute Jump.  The engineering firm of Hardesty &amp; Hanover delivered the resulting report in fall 1983.</p>  </bioghist>
