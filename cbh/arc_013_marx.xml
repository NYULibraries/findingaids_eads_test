    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Ralph H. Marx was licensed by the State of New York as a real estate broker. He earned a B.S. from New York University's School of Commerce, Accounts, and Finance in 1936, and entered the real estate business upon graduation. Beginning in 1958, Marx maintained an office at 2 West Fordham Road, Bronx, N.Y., where he was in association with Robert J. Leonard of Leonard &amp; Schiller. He had previously been Vice President of the firm E. Osborne Smith, Inc. in the Bronx.</p><p>Around 1968, he became the principal and owner of the Ludwig Marx Agency, located at 475 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and moved in 1971 to 663 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Marx's residence seems to have been 175 Riverside Drive in Manhattan.</p><p>Marx took on Howard M. Guttman as a personal assistant around 1964. Guttman prepared data upon which Marx's real estate appraisals were based. Their practice consisted primarily of appraisals used in court testimony, particularly in estate settlement and property tax reduction cases.</p>  </bioghist>
