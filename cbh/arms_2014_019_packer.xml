In June 2015, BHS archivist John Zarrillo, assisted by Stephanie Coy, prepared the collection for transfer from Packer Collegiate Institute to BHS. This process included the consolidation of the collection from 445 boxes to 388 boxes. The collection's arrangement and description remained largely unchanged, although adjustments were made in certain areas to aid researchers. The finding aid and container list was converted from a Word document to an EAD XML file and imported into Archivists' Toolkit in July 2015.</p><p>In September 2015, John Zarrillo commenced processing approximately 80 cubic feet of records that remained on-site at Packer. This work was completed with the assistance of Katie Bednark and Laurin Paradise. Subsequently the arrangement and description of the collection was completely revised by the BHS archivist in June 2016.</p><p>In January 2017, the Packer Collegiate Institute collection (ARC.130), which was comprised of accessions 1985.061 and 1987.016, was incorporated into the Packer Collegiate Institute records (2014.019) by John Zarrillo. These materials include assorted catalogs, publications, and other ephemera. The provenance of those files is as follows: Portions of accession 1985.061 were the gifts of Katharine B. Cronkhite, 1960; Mrs. Joseph Keppler, 1966; Katherine W. Sawford, date unknown; and the Packer Collegiate Institute, date unknown. Remaining materials from this accession were acquired sometime prior to 1985. Accession 1987.016 was the gift of Georgia Giddings, 1987.</p><p>The majority of audiovisual material in this collection was digitized during 2019-2020. Material that was not included in the scope of the digitization project included close duplicates, unidentified B-roll, and items that were determined to have degraded beyond the point of successful transfer. </p><p>Born-digital material in this collection was donated on two 3 1/2 inch floopy disks, thirteen CDs, and twenty-five DVDs. The disks were imaged using Bitcurator-2.0.14. No viruses or personally identifying information was identified during imaging. The finding aid was updated to reflect newly imaged material. In instances when other copies of the content had previously been digitized (largely from MiniDVs), these items were not updated. A small number of disks were not able to imaged successfully (IDs 2014_019_media_007, 2014_019_media_014c, 2014_019_media_017i, 2014_019_media_017j, 2014_019_media_021.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Packer Collegiate Institute was established as the Brooklyn Female Academy on Joralemon Street in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1845. It was formed by a committee of local citizens who were interested in the education of young women. The school's first president was Dr. Alonzo Crittenden, who presided over a student body of 350 girls from 19 states.</p><p>The school burned down on New Years' Day, 1853, and reopened in 1854 with the assistance of a generous $65,000 gift—the largest donation to aid American secondary education at the time—from Mrs. Harriet Packer, widow of William Packer, and former trustee of the Brooklyn Female Academy. One condition of Packer's donation was her request for the dissolution of the Brooklyn Female Academy Corporation, which was to be replaced by what is today's Packer Collegiate Institute. Prominent Brooklyn architect Minard LaFever designed the Gothic Revival building, presently known as Founders Hall.</p><p>In 1883, after Crittenden's death, Truman Backus assumed the role of Packer's new president. As a result, religious studies ceased to be part of the curriculum. During this period, Packer rose to a position of national preeminence in female education. In 1887, the east wing, designed by Napoleon Le Brun, was built to house the gymnasium and science laboratories. In 1907, an Alumnae Hall was adjoined to the physical plant and the subway was constructed under Joralemon Street, which required the school to remove the observatory dome from the main building. Spanning the years 1908 to 1918, Edward Jasper Goodwin served as president and the students received letter grades for the first time.</p><p>John Denbigh succeeded Goodwin and served as president until 1938, overseeing the 1926 addition of the penthouse in Alumnae Hall. Denbigh presided over the establishment of Packer's Junior College in 1919. The school endured the financial impacts of the Great Depression, which resulted in teacher layoffs and salary cuts. In 1938 Paul Shafer became the fifth president of Packer and oversaw the Centennial celebration in 1945. During the 1950s, Packer's Junior College began awarding Associate Degrees and in 1957, Pratt Hall was added to Packer's growing complex of buildings. In 1968, President Shafer retired and Jack Skillman took over the post. In 1969, the school acquired nearby St. Ann's Church.</p><p>By 1972, the Institute experienced major changes, including the disbandment of the Junior College and the introduction of a co-ed student body. The elementary school was divided into Lower and Middle schools during this decade and Peter Esty became headmaster in 1982. Succeeding Esty was J. Geoffrey Pierson who served as the president of Packer from 1990 through 2004. Pierson oversaw the major renovation of the school's buildings and grounds, include the complete renovation of the St. Ann's Church building, which was was completed in 2003. Following Pierson's retirement, Bruce Dennis became the head of school in 2004.</p>  </bioghist>

The transcripts include some or all of the following information: Student grades, dates entered and left Packer, date of birth, home address, parent's name(s), standardized test scores, extra-curricular activities, religious affiliation, and photographs. While most of the transcripts indicate if they are from either the Secondary School or the Junior College, there are some that remain ambiguous. There are records that contain information from both the Secondary School and the Junior College, and occasionally even Elementary School. Some transcripts show both maiden and married name if the student's status changed while attending the school. In most cases, the record is filed by maiden name. However, there are a few records where the maiden name was crossed out and replaced by the married name, in which case it is filed by the married name.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref116_67r"

individual faculty members, as well as faculty events and clubs, which were collected by Packer's Development Office. The dates of the material range from circa 1840s to 2007. An incomplete finding aid that includes dates through 2006 for faculty members containing name, subject taught, and date of death can be found at the beginning of the sub-series.</p><p>Included in this series are correspondences between faculty members; the writings of faculty members; newspaper clippings; personal letters and obituaries. The majority of faculty files are composed of information questionnaires and/or the initial employment applications. Individual faculty files of particular interest are Caroline Chesebrough, a 19th century writer; Bruce Tulloch, former Director of the Upper school; Eleanor Bannister, class of 1875 and distinguished artist who painted many portraits of Packer notables; Alex Bernstein, son of Leonard Bernstein; and Stephen Koplowitz, professional dancer/choreographer and director of Packer's dance program from 1984 onward.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref907_s98" level="file"><did><unittitle>Finding Aid for Faculty Files A-Z 1870 – 2006</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2006/2006"

The bulk of material in this collection dates from 1924 to 1927, when Alice Van Vliet studied and received honors in Classical Moderations at Oxford University in England and toured around post-WWI Europe. Van Vliet documented her experiences in a travel journal and letters that she composed to a large group of friends back in America.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_f845c86d16457ca5159133719f24ee09"><head>Biographical note</head><p>Alice Van Vliet was an American, born on January 11, 1874, and died at age 61 on September 6, 1935. The first available reference to Alice Van Vliet is from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper, which reported that in 1898 Van Vliet was a teacher at the Berkeley Institute (now the Berkeley Carroll School), an all-girls school started in 1886 in Brooklyn, New York. Following this, she was a Latin teacher at Packer Collegiate Institute from 1901 to 1905. Van Vliet is listed as a reader for the College Entrance Examination in 1906, where her title is given as "Director of Latin and Greek" at Packer, and she is credited with holding an A.B. from the University of Chicago, granted 1896. The last known teaching position that Van Vliet occupied was in 1926 and 1927 at the Katherine Branson School in Ross, California.</p><p>A book of Van Vliet's poetry entitled Poems was published in 1937, two years after her death. The dedication reads, "in memory of Alice Van Vliet, January 11, 1874 - September 6, 1935, from her friends, to her friends".</p></bioghist><arrangement id="aspace_b7f98233d85444268b4cf923df452b7d"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>The series is organized into two sub-groups:</p><p>Sub-group 5.3.1: Manuscripts</p><p>Sub-group 5.3.2: Travel Log/Diary Entries, Correspondence and Drafts</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref1524_nnu" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Sub-sub-series 5.3.1: Manuscripts</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1905/1915" type="inclusive">1905-circa 1910</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1c4b40a6b7fc20f6dba9c626d23f443f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This sub-series contains four poems, two plays, miscellaneous manuscripts, and a collection of handwritten copies of Ovid poems.

This includes drafts of letters written by Alice Van Vliet and letters she received while she studied Classical Moderations at Oxford University, England, and traveled throughout Europe during the post-WWI period, 1924-1927. They conclude with correspondence from her time as a teacher at the Katherine Branson School in Ross, California. The tone of these letters is chatty and conversational, revealing personal experiences and the thrill of traveling and studying Classical Moderations at Oxford —referred to as "Mods" in many of her letters and diaries. The material in this Series is in good condition; most are not brittle, though some are difficult to read. Several of the letters were composed while on trains or boats and later typed. Because many of these letters are drafts, the paper is sometimes thin, the handwriting informal, and Van Vliet would often write on both sides of the paper in ink, which would seep through to the other side, thus making the letters almost entirely illegible.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1535_qda" level="file"><did><unittitle>Travel Log/Diary Entries, Correspondence and Drafts</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1924/1924" type="inclusive">1924</unitdate><container id="aspace_eebeec9e9644d19259d863f41a5db130" label="Text [142650000003551]" type="Box">355</container><container parent="aspace_eebeec9e9644d19259d863f41a5db130" type="Folder">9</container></did><odd id="aspace_01b8908fd5b0737241239764150b13d3"><head>General note</head><p>At Sea, dated June 15 &amp; 20, 1924. 2 copies.

Student productions were split into senior and junior performances during the theater's later years. Most of the images, press coverage, and papers in the series collection address senior productions. The students staged a Christmas Pageant every year that included a theatrical reenactment of the Nativity. In addition, repertory and modern productions were performed in the early spring of each year. The stage sets were built and the performances directed by students with adult guidance. In 1979, Packer Theater celebrated its 125th Anniversary by hosting "Today &amp; Yesterday." For publicity purposes, retrospective material was collected about past theater productions for the Packer "Pelican" yearbook. Contents relating to individual plays vary, ranging from photographs and news clippings to promotional material, playbills, scripts, personal notes, and stage budgets.</p><p>The sub-series also includes some items relating to the Alumnae Dramatic Association.</p><p>Additional programs can be found in <emph render="bolditalic">Sub-series 12.4: Curriculum files</emph>. Additional photographs of theatrical productions are found in <emph render="bolditalic">Sub-series 17.1: Packer Collegiate Institute photographs</emph>. Audiovisual recordings of theatrical performances can be found in <emph render="bolditalic">Sub-series 18.5: Theatrical recordings</emph>.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2258_v8y"

Her mother was also a Packer Institute Alumna (class of 1880), as was her daughter Betsey (class of 1943). As a student, Elizabeth Post was active in Glee Club, school plays and debates. She also was active in the Student Settlement Association. She lived in Brooklyn Heights after graduation (Remsen Street), and from the evidence of programs in her papers; she continued to attend Packer functions in the decades following her graduation. She married Thomas Morrow in 1920 and was identified as a philanthropist in a newspaper clipping found in one of her hymnals. She was Vice President of the Associate Alumnae of the Packer Collegiate Institute (years unknown). In 1937 she was appointed to the Packer Collegiate Institute Board of Trustees as the representative of the Association of Alumni. In the same clipping mentioned above, it was noted that she was the 6th woman appointed to the board, and her role was to help bring Packer policies in line with other similar educational institutions. Some time in the 1920s Elizabeth and Thomas Morrow established a homestead in Brookhaven, Long Island, where the Morrow family had formerly lived. The Post-Morrow Homestead in Brookhaven has become the headquarters of the Post Morrow Foundation, which was established by Elizabeth and Thomas to help preserve the rural character of Brookhaven and its surrounding areas in Suffolk County. Well into the 1970s Mrs. Morrow continued to give regularly, and often generously, to Packer funds.</p></bioghist><arrangement id="aspace_d9bbdf0b5658bd86b18b7e17f0e72549"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>The sub-sub-series is organized into four sub-sub-sub-series:</p><p>Sub-sub-sub-series 8.5.2.1: School Memorabilia</p><p>Sub-sub-sub-series 8.5.2.2: Hymnals</p><p>Sub-sub-sub-series 8.5.2.3: Packer Events</p><p>Sub-sub-sub-series 8.5.2.4: Alumni Activities</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref2493_vvw" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Sub-sub-sub-series 8.5.2.1: School Memorabilia</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">0.4 Cubic Feet</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1880/1918" type="inclusive">1880-1918</unitdate><physdesc id="aspace_6a81f1842ee5f7c5caf9df145a5f1338" label="General Physical Description note"><extent>in eight folders</extent></physdesc></did><scopecontent id="aspace_12ada0a7210b448614bde5623b7a848d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The sub-sub-sub-series contains Packer memorabilia, dating from 1880 to 1818.

File 2 has a few items related to a dinner in honor Dr. John H. Denbigh (1937). Dr. Denbigh retired that year as president of the Packer Collegiate Institute. File 3 contains clippings, invitation, and programs for the Edwin Jasper Memorial Lectures (1938-1937). Robert Moses was the speaker in 1939. These are fragile and need encapsulation. File 4 contains Centenary Celebration programs, invitations, lyric sheets and other related from 1945. File 5, Class of 1916 Material, contains items found in an envelope related to the class of 1916, including invitations to special graduation events in 1916, dance cards, and programs.

The files contain a mixture of materials generated by the Associate Alumnae of the Packer Collegiate Institute, Packer itself, and personal notes from the school administration or other alumna to Elizabeth Post Morrow. The majority of the records are fund raising letters, reports, brochures and event ephemera. Some of these materials are informative, especially letters and reports to the Associate Alumni written by Packer president John F. Skillman. Topics cover the financial troubles or well being of the school, enrollment concerns (1952), closing of the junior college (1971) and the decision to become a co-educational school (1972). There are a few hand written memos relating to Associate Alumnae business, mostly dating from late 1930s to the early 1950s. Other materials include invitations and programs of school events, reprints of speeches by Packer presidents, promotional brochures (some of these have photographs), newspaper clippings covering Packer news, announcements of changes in administration, and expansion of the school facility. Materials of particular interest are: a report card from 1930s reflecting concerns with appearance and deportment, a 1972 Coeducation Study Preliminary Report, a study on the junior college, and a 1969 letter from President on changes being considered to the school. There are several issues of the Packer Times from 1972–1973.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2524_005" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alumni materials (3 folders)</unittitle><unitdate

The first is correspondence to/from Dr. Truman Jay Backus (1842-1908), President of the Faculty at Packer Collegiate Institute from September 1883 through March 1908. The range of topics covered in this correspondence to/from Dr. Truman Jay Backus (1842-1908) includes scholastic accommodations and referrals for students, scholarship recommendations, faculty accommodations, and recommendations for teacher applicants and administrative matters such as building maintenance and facilities.</p><p>The sub-series has been broken into four sub-sub-series that include: 1) Multiple Correspondences arranged alphabetically by name; 2) General Correspondence between teachers; 3) Chronological files; and 4) Biographical/Memorabilia of Truman J. Backus</p><p><emph render="underline">Multiple Correspondences</emph></p><p>Highlights from this sub-sub-series include correspondence with William C. Lawton which constitutes a full exchange between Lawton and Dr. Backus about a teaching position, including interesting professional negotiations. Mr. Lawton did not end up teaching at the school. Noteworthy are the teacher recommendations made to Backus by Miss Lucy M. Salmon, Associate Professor of History at Vassar.</p><p>Additional materials include a folder containing correspondence between Backus and members of the Board of Trustees including letters from Board member Seth Low (1850-1916), who was the Mayor of Brooklyn, the Mayor of New York City, and served as the President of Columbia University. It also includes a six-page letter from Mr. McKeen, board member, in opposition to recommendations to the board to increase tuition. Also of noted significance is the last folder in the sub-series: correspondences between parents and Dr. Backus (1882-1891). The topics covered in this set include parental concerns over scarlet fever, scholarships, and lunch dismissals.</p><p><emph render="underline">General Correspondence</emph></p><p>Contains letters between Truman J. Backus and members of the teaching faculty. There is a letter written by Backus to the teaching staff asking for their opinions on the usage of the phrases "awfully bad" and "awfully pretty" (1900) and several responses from the teaching staff.</p><p>In addition, an eight-page letter from the Committee on Instruction (1899) regarding the possible reduction in teaching staff; a twenty page Report from Dr. Backus to the Committee on Instruction (1886) regarding curriculum; reports from Miss Susan K. Cook, teacher of "Mental and Moral Philosophy"; a report on individual teacher performance and recommendations about changes in assignments for teachers. This final report provides instructions on teaching etiquette accompanied by a 3 page statistical report.</p><p><emph render="underline">Chronological files</emph></p><p>Includes folders that span the years 1883-1894 with the exception of 1893.</p><p><emph render="underline">Biographical/Memorabilia of Truman J. Backus</emph></p><p>Contained in this sub-sub-series are 1) Published items written by Dr. Backus and 2) Biographical material about Dr. Backus. There is a short pamphlet written by Dr. Backus entitled: "Various Phases of an Important Subject" pertaining to the education of Blacks in the South, published by American Missionary Association, 12 pages. This sub series also contains a memorial essay written about the school's founder, Harriet Packer by Dr. Backus, and describes the education of young women in Brooklyn, in addition to detailing the first meeting between Dr. Backus and Mrs. Packer.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2959_9ra" level="file"><did><unittitle>Allinson, Francis G.

The speeches address WWII and its impact on education. Speeches following WWII are addressed to the PTA and focus on education within the home. Two examples of Shafer's writings appear in print outside of the Packer community: Forbes Magazine and Vital Speeches of the Day. A large formal document, with the signature and official seal of New York City's Mayor, Fiorello H. LaGuardia, and names Shafer a trustee of the Brooklyn Public Library. Shafer's 1967 announcement of his retirement is also included in the series by the Alumni Association. Materials are in good condition, although, Vital Speeches of the Day magazine's condition is deteriorating and should be handled with care.</p><p>The secound group of material consists of Dr. Shafer's office files. Arranged in rough chronological order for the academic years between 1960-1967. Folders include: Annual Report, Daily Program, Finances, School Organization and Administration and Teacher Reports. Items within this group detail Dr. Shafer's philosophy of education, his leadership style and his thoughts regarding topical issues pertaining to the school as a whole. The format of materials ranges from printed programs to handwritten notes on 4 x 7 colored note cards.</p><p>The Annual Report folders contain President Shafer's notes in preparation of his reports to the Board of Trustees. The Daily Program folders contain Dr. Shafer's notes for addresses to groups including the Board of Trustees, faculty, and students at the beginning of the each school year. Many notes are typed with handwritten edits while others are handwritten. There are printed programs for school events such as theater performances or the Christmas Carol Sing. There are minutes from meetings of the Board, and there are lists such as, "Colleges entered by graduates of the Academic School."</p><p>The Finance Reports are inconsistent between 1960 and 1968. The Treasurer of the Board of Trustees is responsible for delivering these reports detailing school expenses for events such as theater performances or the Spring Concert.</p><p>The School Administration and Organization folders contain items dealing with campus life and the President's responsibilities. Some items are related to the faculty such as a description of the school's Major Medical Insurance policy coverage and a list of new teachers, or instructions, such as "Procedures for Examinations." Some items detail student life, for example Permission Slip forms for a school dance or a directive regarding the lapsed enforcement of rules prohibiting girls from leaving school between the times of arrival and dismissal. Miscellaneous items include air raid drill instructions and a list of families with two or more children in the school.</p><p>The Teachers' Report folders are comprised of evaluations by faculty members, reports on the activities school clubs and reports from the dean and department heads. Among the materials are mimeographed examples of class assignments and exams.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref3021_hkw" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photographs of Dr. Paul

The various renderings and blueprints provide detailed information on Chapman's alterations. Large-scale floor plans of the entire campus are filed, as well as specific treatments of such areas as the dining room, gymnasium, sundeck, library, and greenroom.</p><p>The sub-series also includes drawings and blueprints created by various firms as proposals for the installation of the institute's steam heating system circa 1882. It is unclear which, if any of the firms, actually won the contract. Dated the same year is a correspondence from Otis Brothers &amp; Company regarding the installation of an electric elevator. The company provided Packer with a blueprint for this elevator on June 5, 1891. The series also contains architectural blueprints and watercolors from 1944.</p><p>The plan books and specifications document a variety of alterations, building additions, and demolitions undertaken at Packer from the 1880s to the 1950s. The materials in the series affords researchers a vantage from which to better understand the architectural evolution of the campus at 170 Joralemon Street. Of special interest are: Architect William Tubby's specifications and instructions for the major alterations performed before World War I; James Gamble Rogers' materials and plans for the building's subsequent overhaul in 1940; the promotional materials describing proposed additions to mark Packer's centennial celebration in 1945; and intensive specifications describing the large-scale alterations performed in 1957 by Champan, Evans, and Delehanty.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_6311456ade3c51237277fd58b07ab80b"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref4467_qnv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Illustration of Packer Collegiate Institute building by J.

Topically, the photographs document students (incuding individual portraits, class portraits, various school events, and activities), administrators and faculty, and Packer buildings.</p><p>Additional photographs can be found in <emph render="bolditalic">Sub-series 8.3: Packer Theater</emph>, <emph render="bolditalic">Sub-series 11.2: Press releases and photographs</emph>, <emph render="bolditalic">Sub-series 12.4: Curriculum files</emph>, <emph render="bolditalic">Sub-series 12.10: Alumni Questionnaires</emph>, and <emph render="bolditalic">Sub-series 12.14: Alumni events</emph>.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref4594_7p7" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Sub-series 17.1: Packer Collegiate Institute photographs</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">50 Cubic Feet</extent><extent altrender="carrier">in 107 boxes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1845/2015" type="inclusive">circa 1850-circa 2010</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_df374d9a7ee1359c52a212a1924fbfc4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The sub-series contains a substantial amount of photographs documenting life at Packer, dating from circa 1850 to circa 2010. It is primarily composed of prints, but also includes negatives (especially for photographs dating from the 1980s to 2000s), contact sheets, digital images, and other photographic mediums.</p><p>Thematically, the photographs cover various aspects of student life, including class work, arts, sports, class trips, special events, and extracurricular activities. It also documents the interior and exterior of Packer's building through the years.</p><p>The photographs were used for a variety of purposes, including the school's yearbook and various school publications.</p><p>Please note: many file descriptions include a five-digit, hyphenated number as part of the file description. These numbers are formatted XX-YYY, in which XX is a year indicator and YYY a sequential indicator. Thus, 98-002 indicates that the envelope is labeled as being from 1998, and is the second sequentially in its order, after 98-001 and before 98-003. These numbers were found on the envelopes in which the photographs were stored, and have been preserved to aid in the location of materials. However, they should be relied upon only with the understanding that not all photograph envelopes came with such a number, and thus the sequential ordering should be considered in no way absolute. In the instance that two photograph envelopes were found to possess the same numerical code, the two envelopes were designated within the file descriptions as variants (A) and (B) of the same five-digit code (ex: 98-002A and 98-002B).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f110449c061119a6cb0c1c65c139e6ca"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>Arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref4597_n3w" level="file"><did><unittitle>Building - Interior - Entrance Hall with statute of Reverend Dr. Bethune.

In addition, there are tapes documenting important seminars: ATIS (Association of Teachers of Independent Schools), meetings as early as 1980, NAIS (National Association of Independent Schools), on the role of the arts in education, and yearly NAIS meetings.

Images are mounted in both landscape and portrait orientation and vary in size. Mat board dimensions are predominately between 9x12 - 11x14 inches. Several prints are without mounting, all have been encapsulated. These photo cards were likely employed as visual aids in the teaching of a survey of western art and were often sold as thematic albums. The dates of use were likely during the last quarter of the 19th century through the early 1900s. The subjects of most of the images are Renaissance and Baroque art, including architecture (cathedrals, sculpture, plans, and elements), sculpture, paintings, and sacred decorative objects (reliquaries). Photographs were taken at the sites where their subject was created or resided at the time, which was primarily throughout northern Italy (Florence, Siena, Lucca, Pisa, and Venice). Many of the photographs include a caption or have a label fixed to mat board. A number of photo cards include maker's mark, the most prevalent being Alinari, the first and largest provider of these materials specific to the subject.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref8547_b9t" level="file"><did><unittitle>70 Photo cards depicting Western Art and Architecture</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1880/1909" type="inclusive">1880s-1900s</unitdate><container id="aspace_644e073e4d66f4004bc1d5893e639bb3" label="Graphic Materials [142650000003569]" type="Box">356</container><container parent="aspace_644e073e4d66f4004bc1d5893e639bb3" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref8548_t2x" level="file"><did><unittitle>73 Photo cards depicting Western Art and Architecture</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1880/1909" type="inclusive">1880s-1900s</unitdate><container id="aspace_fba2cb043ab0f4c5565d0e8956b42273" label="Graphic Materials [142650000003577]" type="Box">357</container><container parent="aspace_fba2cb043ab0f4c5565d0e8956b42273" type="Folder">1</container></did></c></c></c><c id="aspace_ref8617_um6" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 20: Junior College</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1932/1972" type="inclusive">1932-1972</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a8e4fb81264be3b8ea622deec3f6be0f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The series contains files relating to Packer's Junior College, which operated from 1919 to 1972.
