    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Free Kindergarten Society was founded in 1891 as the Brooklyn Kindergarten Association with the mission of providing early childhood education to children in Brooklyn's impoverished immigrant neighborhoods, and to promote interest in such work throughout the City (and later, Borough) of Brooklyn.  With this in mind, the Association established the first free kindergarten classes in Brooklyn soon after its formation. The name of the Association was changed to the Brooklyn Free Kindergarten Society in 1895, and as of 2010, it is known simply as the Brooklyn Kindergarten Association. The Society continues to carry out its core mission, serving immigrant and low-income children in the Crown Heights, Brownsville, and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods of Brooklyn.</p>  </bioghist>
