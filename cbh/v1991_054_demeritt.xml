    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>In the summer of 1965, Terry Lymon and several assistants undertook an archaeological excavation of a parcel of land located in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood and bounded by Fulton, Middagh, and Henry Streets. The land had recently been razed for the construction of Cadman Plaza. In the course of their excavation, the team uncovered several cisterns and dry wells, as well as many artifacts, including bottles, ceramics, part of a pipe organ, and a pair of men's pants dating from the 19th century. Lymon, along with two of the excavation team members, Martin Schneider and Dwight B. Demeritt Jr., presented their findings at a lecture hosted by the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) on September 20, 1965.</p>  </bioghist>
