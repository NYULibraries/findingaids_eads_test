      <abstract id="aspace_129fdc346011502949215dc74b9917d9">Face of Brooklyn consists of 281 digital photographic images, stored on 3 DVDs. The images are all portraits of Brooklyn residents and visitors, taken by Nora Herting at open portrait studios in neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn in 2008. Subjects volunteered to be photographed on the spot; most, photographed either alone or with friends or family, appear in front of a white background.

The artist views the collection as a response to the portraits already featured in the Brooklyn Historical Society's collection, which do not represent the diversity of Brooklyn's residents.</abstract>

      <head>System of arrangement</head>
      <p>The digital images are arranged in file folders on DVDs according to the neighborhood in which the photographs were taken. Series were arranged in chronological order by the date that they were photographed, and images were numbered chronologically based on the filenames assigned by the artist's camera.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>The information from participants' data sheets was entered into Excel by Nora Herting's assistants Nancy Borowick and Helena (last name?).</p>
      <p>Images were originally arranged in folders by location, with several folders on each DVD. The series and photographs were numbered chronologically in 2010 by Emily Reynolds. At that time, it was discovered that there were several discrepancies between the Excel index and the actual photos possessed by BHS, including the complete absence of the photos taken in Red Hook. The artist was contacted.</p>

    <scopecontent id="aspace_343b36fbc30520ef03c2e40fef36387f">
      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>Nora Herting's born-digital collection, Face of Brooklyn, consists of 281 photographic images on 3 (4? - awaiting Red Hook) DVDs. Photographs were taken at open portrait studios in neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn in 2008. Forms with brief biographical information, signed by subjects or guardians, support the images. An Excel spreadsheet of the form information was also included on one of the DVDs.</p>
      <p>The open air portrait studios were set up by the artist, with assistance from volunteers, in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Coney Island, Crown Heights, Fort Greene, Midwood, Prospect Heights, and Red Hook, as well as in Prospect Park and McCarren Park in Brooklyn. Subjects volunteered on the spot; most, photographed either alone or with friends or family, appear in front of a white background. The images contrast the formality of portraiture with everyday life in progress. The portraits reflect the diversity and individuality of Brooklyn's residents.</p>
