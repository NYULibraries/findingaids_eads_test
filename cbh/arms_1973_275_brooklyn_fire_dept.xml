      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The first record of organized firefighting in the town of Brooklyn, one of the six original towns comprising the present-day borough of Brooklyn, dates from 1772.  An official Fire Department, consisting solely of volunteers, was established in 1785.  By 1816, when Brooklyn was formally incorporated as a village, the Village of Brooklyn Fire Department had a total roll of 95 volunteer firefighters.  In 1869, the then-City of Brooklyn's first paid professional Fire Department went into operation.</p>
