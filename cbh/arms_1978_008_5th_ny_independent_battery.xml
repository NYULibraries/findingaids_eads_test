    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Union Army Light Artillery, 5th New York Independent Battery records consist mainly of muster rolls listing the names and activities of soldiers in the Battery throughout the period 1861 to 1865.  Each muster roll also notes the general alterations to the Battery since the last roll taken.  The October 1863 muster documents the presence in camp of African-Americans as servants to the battery's officers. The muster rolls include the muster-in of November 1861 and the muster-out from the conclusion of the unit's initial term of service in November 1864. Additional items include rolls of absentees and deserters, and discharge, furlough and other documents of Private (later 2nd Lieutenant) William H. Cornell.  Finally, the collection includes a printed roster of the Brooklyn-based George C. Strong Post No. 534 of the Grand Army of the Republic.  The roster, dating from circa 1910, contains a list of Post officers; a Roll of Honor listing deceased members, along with dates of death and places of burial; a list of active members; and bylaws.  Additional handwritten notes indicating changes to the roster through circa 1912 are also filed throughout the booklet.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The 5th New York Independent Battery, a unit of the Union Army Light Artillery during the Civil War, was organized in New York City and mustered into service for a period of three years beginning on November 8, 1861.  Men recruited into the Battery came mainly from Brooklyn, Peekskill, New York City, Staten Island, and Yonkers.  The Battery, commanded by Captain Elijah D. Taft, was active in several major battles throughout the War, including Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Gettysburg, and was also active in Philip Sheridan's campaign in the Shenandoah.  After the expiration of its term in 1864, the Battery remained in service until it was honorably discharged on July 6, 1865.  Certain surviving members of the Battery, including private (and later 2nd lieutenant) William H. Cornell, became members of the Brooklyn-based George C. Strong Post No. 534 of the Grand Army of the Republic, a national association of Union Army veterans.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
