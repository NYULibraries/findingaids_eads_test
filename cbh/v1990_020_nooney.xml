      <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Dinanda H. Nooney (1918-2004) was a documentary photographer and native New Yorker. Nooney's first extensive photographic project documented the collapsed West Side Highway in Manhattan in the mid 1970s. Nooney began photographing families throughout the borough of Brooklyn in 1976. Covering dozens of neighborhoods in the borough from Greenpoint to Sea Gate, Nooney documented over 150 families, completing the bulk of the work between 1978 and 1979. Photographs from the Brooklyn project were exhibited at the Long Island Historical Society in 1985, under the title At Home in Brooklyn.</p>
