    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The First Presbyterian Church of Southold was founded in 1640 in the town of Southold, Long Island, New York, and was originally called the First Church of Christ in Southold. The church was officially incorporated in 1784, and in 1832 it united with the Presbytery of Long Island and became known as the First Presbyterian Church of Southold. As of 2011, the church is still active, holding weekly worship services in its early 19th century chapel.</p>  </bioghist>
