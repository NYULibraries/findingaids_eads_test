<p>The <emph render="bold">Ichthyophagous Club</emph> was a dinner club which was established in the City of New York in 1880. The group organized dinners which featured seafood which was not typically prepared for 19th century meals, such as shark, octopus, skate, and other sea animals. Dinners were held at several locations between 1880 and 1887, including the Murray Hill Hotel, J.H. Starin's Glen Island, Havermeyer's Point, the Hotel Brighton, the Manhattan Beach Hotel, the Hotel Buckingham, and the Palisade Mountain House.</p>    <list type="ordered">

<p>The <emph render="bold">Mariners' Guide and Wanderers' Aid Society</emph> of the City of New York was organized by members of the First Baptist Mariners' Church, along with other Manhattan and Brooklyn based Baptist church members, in 1866. According to the preamble of the organization's constitution and by-laws, the group was formed, "for the purpose of guarding and protecting the mariners who enter the port of New York and giving comfort to the desponding wanderers." The group operated mission rooms at the Mariners' Temple, located at Oliver Street and Henry Street, in Manhattan. Members conducted missionary visits to ships, distributed bibles, and offered religious services to sailors and other travelers.</p>    <list type="ordered">
