    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Eugene L. Armbruster was born in Baden-Baden, Germany in 1865. In 1882, he immigrated to New York City and lived in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn until his death in 1943. He and his family were long-time residents of Eldert Street. He worked (and appeared to have some stake in) the H. Henkel Cigar Box Manufacturing Company until his retirement in 1920. Following retirement, Armbruster became an amateur photographer and local historian writing for the "Old-Timer" column of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle and published pamphlets about local history. In the column, he answered questions related to homes and properties throughout Brooklyn.
The majority of his photographs and scrapbooks were created from the 1910s and 1920s. Armbruster seemed particularly interested in infrastructure and preserving history through his photographs, scrapbook clippings, and annotations that he viewed as vanishing during a period of rapid growth and change in Brooklyn. In his book, The Eastern District of Brooklyn (1912), he writes, "If a history of the City of New York will ever be written, its compiler will look around for historical matter relating to the old towns, now forming parts of the metropolis, and this book was written that the Eastern District of Brooklyn may be represented then."
Armbruster was a voracious reader of New York City histories and walked extensively throughout Brooklyn and beyond, photographing buildings and landscapes, a majority of which include annotations with historic information. The photographs primarily feature Brooklyn, but also showcase Manhattan, Queens, Nassau County and Suffolk County. Between 1914 and 1929, Armbruster published several pamphlets about local history including hand-drawn maps, drawings, original photographs and newspaper clippings. His published books focus on the history of Brooklyn from Dutch settlement in the 17th century to the early 20th century. 
Armbruster developed cataracts late in life preventing him from continuing his photographic work. He died on September 21, 1943 at the age of seventy-eight.

<p>The Eugene L. Armbruster photographs and scrapbooks date from 1900 to 1939 and measure 7 linear feet.

The scrapbooks were likely used as a resources for Armbruster's published books and not created to be shared.
