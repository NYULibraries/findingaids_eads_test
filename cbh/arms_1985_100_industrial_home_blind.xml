<p>The Industrial Home for the Blind collection comprises 0.4 linear feet of materials and spans the years 1894 to 1953. Included are annual reports, newsletters, and two informational booklets published by the Home. The annual reports span the years 1894 to 1915 and include financial reports, lists of donors and donations, membership lists, summaries of annual activities and achievements, and lists of clients served by the Home. The newsletters include copies of the IHB News, circa 1940-1949; The Light Buoy, 1938, 1944; and The Reporter, 1953. These newsletters highlight accomplishments of the Home, services offered to clients, client success stories, and general issues of concern to blind people. One of the informational booklets is dated 1933 and was published in celebration of the Home's 40th anniversary; the other was published circa 1930 to 1950 and provides general information on the services offered by the Home.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Founded in 1883 by Eben P. Morford, who had been blinded as a child by an accident with a firearm, the mission of the Industrial Home for the Blind was to provide education, skills training, job opportunities, and community for the blind in Brooklyn. Originally located at 96 Lexington Avenue, the Home subsequently expanded several times, adding new facilities in different locations, and ultimately establishing its general offices at 57 Willoughby Street, where as of 2010 it continues to operate as the Helen Keller Services for the Blind.</p>  </bioghist>
