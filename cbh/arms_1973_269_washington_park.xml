      <p>Washington Park was designated as a public park in the Fort Greene district of the City of Brooklyn in 1845, and the New York State Legislature officially passed an act to secure land for the Park in 1847.  Designs for the improvement of the Park were made by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the designers of Central and Prospect Parks, beginning in 1867.  The Park was renamed Fort Greene Park in 1897.</p>
