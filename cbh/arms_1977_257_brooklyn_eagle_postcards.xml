    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph> was a daily newspaper that was published in Brooklyn for over 114 years. Founded in 1841 by Isaac van Anden and Henry Cruse Murphy, the newspaper was originally named the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle and King's County Democrat</emph>. In 1850, the name was changed to the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph>. By the early 1860s, the newspaper had become one of the most widely read papers in the United States. In 1938, the newspaper underwent another name change when it became the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph>. Frank D. Schroth bought the paper in 1940 and continued to publish it until 1955 when the <emph render="italic">Eagle</emph> ceased publication during a lengthy strike by the New York Newspaper Guild. Between 1960 and 1963, the <emph render="italic">Eagle</emph> once again resumed publication, this time as a weekly paper (though for a short time as a daily). The run was short-lived and the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph> office closed in December 1963.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
