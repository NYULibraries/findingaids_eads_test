    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Brooklyn's Reformed Church on the Heights was a Protestant congregation named for its location in the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights.  Construction on the Church's building, located on the northwest side of Pierrepont Street at Monroe Place and designed in the Renaissance Revival style by noted church architect Minard Lafever, was completed in 1851.  The Church was later demolished to make way for the Court House of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court.</p>  </bioghist>
