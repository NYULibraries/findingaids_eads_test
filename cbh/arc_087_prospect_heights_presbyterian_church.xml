    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Prospect Heights Presbyterian Church was founded in 1888 as a merger of the Memorial and First Presbyterian Church on Seventh Avenue and the Twelfth Street Reformed Church, both of Brooklyn, N.Y. The chapel was constructed at Eighth Avenue and Tenth Street, located in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, and dedicated on April 7, 1889. The church was home to an active congregation, with social groups such as the Ladies' Aid Society and Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, and formed a part of the Presbytery of New York City.</p><p>With the rise of the Catholic population in Park Slope, the congregation of Prospect Heights Presbyterian Church began to shrink, resulting in financial difficulties for the church during the mid-20th century. The congregation disbanded in 1980s, and the the Church of the Gethsemane  took possession of the chapel in 1989.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
