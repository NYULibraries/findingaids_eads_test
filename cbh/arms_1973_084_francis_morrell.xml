    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Francis V. Morrell's manuscript "Recollections of Old Williamsburgh" describes the social, economic, geographic, and built environments of old Williamsburgh, Brooklyn during the mid-nineteenth century.  This memoir-like document is organized around 24 separate topics, including Williamsburgh Village, Williamsburgh City, schools, ferries, shipyards, storekeepers and businessmen, and a cannon named Old Sal.  Morrell's recollections describe in detail the layout of the financial area of Williamsburgh, centered around Woodhull Street and City Hall; as well as surrounding villages such as Bedford and Bushwick.  Also included herein are many detailed descriptions of townspeople, some of whom were non-white residents of the city, such as "Happy Jack," a middle-aged African American man whose moving services were often called upon by the people of Williamsburgh and whose "whistle could be heard at all times."  Also included herein is an illustrated entry for "The Fountain Inn," the principal meeting place of the city for political and leisurely activities.  Morrell outlines the layout of the streets of Williamsburgh along with many of the prominent businesses on Grand, 2nd, 4th, and Woodhull Streets.  Numerous descriptions are included of storekeepers in Williamsburgh, highlighting their specialties and location, such as Atwater, the druggist who sold Morrell and his childhood friends molasses peppermint sticks.  Among the other townspeople described in this manuscript are Jonathan S. Burr, Richard Laycroft, Noah Waterbury, and Honey in the Comb.  Entries for the Williamsburgh Gazette and the Bushwick Church are also included.  Morrell also includes a rough list, based on a published pamphlet, of townspeople whose homes had the highest value.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Francis Vandervoort Morrell (1844-1922) grew up in the city of Williamsburgh (now Williamsburg, Brooklyn); his written manuscript herein describes the people and places of his childhood.  Morrell's father, by the same name, was a wealthy man of Williamsburgh.  While he spent some years in the insurance industry, Morrell's interest in genealogy led him to compile numerous genealogies later in life, such as <emph render="italic">The ancestry and posterity of Cornelius Henry Tiebout of Brooklyn</emph> (1910), and the <emph render="italic">Genealogy of the Meserole family of Greenpoint </emph> (1915).</p>  </bioghist>
