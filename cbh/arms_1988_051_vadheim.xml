    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Heights Association ("BHA") was formed in 1910, and remains the oldest neighborhood association in New York City. Residents and business owners in Brooklyn Heights organized the group to advocate for the improvement and preservation of the neighborhood. The Association formed committees to address issues pertinent to resident and neighborhood concerns, such as civil improvement, police, traffic, parking, trees, and recreation. BHA supported the New York City Landmarks Preservation Law and in 1965, Brooklyn Heights was designated as the first Historic District in New York City. In 2010, BHA celebrated its centennial anniversary and remains an active and influential organization in Brooklyn Heights.</p>  </bioghist>
