    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>From the 17th through the 19th centuries, Long Island was divided into three counties: Kings (the present-day borough of Brooklyn), Queens (the present-day borough of Queens), and Suffolk.  On January 1, 1898, the western towns comprising Queens County became part of New York City, while the eastern towns, including Hempstead, North Hempstead, and Oyster Bay, remained part of Queens County.  On January 22 of that year, the citizens of the latter three towns met in the village of Mineola to deliberate upon the formation of a new county to be named Nassau County.  On April 27, 1898, New York Governor Frank S. Black signed into law the official formation of Nassau County, which took effect on January 1, 1899.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
