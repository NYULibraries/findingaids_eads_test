    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Photocopies of a transcription and translation by Arthur J. Weise of an excerpt from Joannes de Laet's 1625 Dutch publication  <emph render="italic">Nieuwe Wereldt ofte Beschrijvinghe van West-Indien, uit veelerhande Schriften ende Aen-teekeningen van verscheyden Natien</emph>, known colloquially in English as History of the New World. The copies are accompanied by a 1952 typed letter sent to a Mr. Merritt, apparently from someone at the New-York Historical Society. The letter states that the transcribed and translated excerpted reference to Long Island from de Laet's text was "found by Mr. Kelly" "amongst his manuscripts." This is presumably James A. Kelly, former Brooklyn Borough Historian, and the manuscripts presumably refer to those once held at Borough Hall under Kelly's supervision.</p><p>The first page of the excerpt's English translation notes that it was "transcribed and translated by Arthur James Weise, Brooklyn, February 24, 1906." At that time, Weise was working on a project to document early Brooklyn history under the auspices of the Committee on Brooklyn History, which was founded by the City of Brooklyn and later continued by the City of Greater New York, always under the supervision of the Long Island Historical Society. Weise's translation here is headed "Twenty-Seventh Manuscript," which matches the listings of copied manuscripts for the project in the Committee on Brooklyn History records (1977.256). Documentation in the committee records seems to indicate that the interest of this particular excerpt was that it may have been the first known written document to name Long Island as such.</p>  </scopecontent>
