      <p>The collection comprises 38 digital photographic images taken by Leigh Celentano to document the after effects of Hurricane Sandy, as well as relief efforts. Locations include unidentified areas of Staten Island, the Rockaways in Queens, and the following Brooklyn neighborhoods: Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Red Hook and Sunset Park. Extensive damages caused by the wind and the water are captured in images of downed trees and streetlights, torn fences, flood-affected buildings, and street debris. Relief efforts documented in these photographs include cyclists transporting supplies and groups of people distributing clothing.</p>

      <p>Hurricane Sandy landed in New York City on Tuesday, October 30th, 2012. Approximately 2.2 million residents lost electricity for at least a full day if not longer, and hundreds of thousands of buildings were damaged by considerable flooding, particularly in Lower Manhattan, Long Island, Staten Island, and coastal areas of Queens and Brooklyn. Economic losses in New York City were estimated to be roughly $19 billion; notably, the Stock Exchange was closed for two days, the first two-day closure since the Great Blizzard of 1888. At least 53 people died in New York as a result of the storm.</p>
