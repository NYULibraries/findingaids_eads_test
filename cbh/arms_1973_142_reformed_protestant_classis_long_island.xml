<p>This minute book contains an extract of minutes of a meeting of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, Classis of Long Island.  The meeting convened in the town of Jamaica in Queens County, N.Y. in December 1821, and was called to investigate and try the charges of "want of veracity and honesty" brought against the Reverend Zachariah H. Kuypers by Daniel Hoogland, Commissioner of the New Church of North Hempstead, Long Island.  The minute book also includes a statement regarding the trial by the Elders of the New Church of North Hempstead, dating from January 1822, and newspaper clippings, attached separately, relating to medicinal treatments for various diseases.</p>  </scopecontent>
