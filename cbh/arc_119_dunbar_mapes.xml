The collection contains genealogical notes on 20 families from New York State (mostly from Suffolk County and Orange County) including four Brooklyn families: the Mapes, Vanderveers, Tuthills, and Pratts. Additionally, there are extensive reference notes citing the sources from which Mapes attained his genealogical information. Finally, the collection includes a Photostat and typescript copy of a portion of the last will and testament of Thomas Mapes of Southold, Long Island, N.Y., 1686.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Lester Dunbar Mapes was born in New York, N.Y. on January 14, 1866. He married Edith Louise Tuthill (1873-1944) on March 24, 1897 and they had three children: Gerard Sinclair, Bruce Allan, and Donald Lester Mapes. According to the 1930 United States census, Lester and Edith Mapes lived in Brooklyn. Mapes was an active genealogist in the 1930s and the early 1940s. He died suddenly on October 24, 1944 and was therefore unable to publish most of his genealogical writings. Outside of his genealogical work, Mapes worked as a Certified Public Accountant.</p><p>Thomas Mapes (1628-1687) emigrated from England circa 1638 and by the 1640s had become a resident of Southold, Long Island, N.Y. In Southold, he was a land owner and worked as a surveyor. Thomas Mapes married Sarah Purrier (circa 1630-1697), also originally from England, around 1650. They had eleven children including Thomas, Rebecca, William, Abigail, Sarah, Mary, Jabez, Naomi, and Jonathan. Lester Dunbar Mapes was a descendant of Thomas and Sarah Mapes.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
