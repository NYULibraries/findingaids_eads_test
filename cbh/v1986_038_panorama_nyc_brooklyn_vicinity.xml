<p>The <emph render="italic">Panorama of New York, Brooklyn, and Vicinity</emph> viewbook was published by the Wittemann Brothers in 1879. The viewbook contains two black-and-white panoramic foldouts of views from the top of the Brooklyn Bridge towers--from the Brooklyn-side tower looking towards Manhattan and from the Manhattan-side tower looking towards Brooklyn. Buildings, businesses, streets, and parks are noted in the margins of the panoramas. The panoramas also document maritime activity on New York Harbor. The viewbook retains its original hardcover, though the foldouts have separated from the binding. Page size for each section of the foldout is 5 x 7.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Wittemann Brothers was a Brooklyn-based publishing company that was founded by brothers Adolph and Herman L. Wittemann, circa 1879. In 1890, the company changed its name to the Albertype Company, denoting the company's use of the collotype (also called albertype) photographic process. The publishing company operated from 1890 to 1952 and produced over 25,000 prints. The Albertype Company produced their own photographs (Adolph was a photographer), as well as reproduced photographic images produced by other companies or individual photographers. Using the prints, the company published postcards and viewbooks. Viewbooks, also called souvenir albums or view albums, are books that contain commercially published groups of photographs depicting a place, activity, or event.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
