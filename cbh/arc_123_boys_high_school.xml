<p>Established in 1891, Boys' High School was the first public high school in Brooklyn, N.Y. It began operation as the Central Grammar School on Court Street in Downtown Brooklyn. In 1892, the school relocated to a newly-constructed Romanesque Revival building on Marcy Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn and had already gained over 500 students. The creation of Boys' High signaled a new focus on providing free secondary education for young men in the city, and soon to be borough, of Brooklyn. The curriculum offered at Boys' High included classical, scientific, and commericial courses. </p><p>The school building was landmarked in 1975, and Boys' High School merged with Girls' High School that year. Street Academy High School now occupies the building in Bedford-Stuyvesant.</p><p>Established in 1891, Boys' High School was the first all-boys public high school in Brooklyn, N.Y.

In 1892, the school relocated to a newly-constructed Romanesque Revival building on Marcy Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The founding of Boys' High School and enrollment of over 500 students in its first two years emphasized a need in the city--and soon to be borough--of Brooklyn to provide free secondary education.
