    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection's original finding aid referred to historical information regarding churches in Flatbush and Flatlands. It was determined that there had likely been confusion between this collection and the Jeremiah Johnson manuscript on the Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church (1973.128). This finding aid was revised accordingly and the collection rehoused by Dee Bowers in 2023.</p>  </processinfo>
