    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Sea Gate Sisterhood was formed in 1911 by a group of women to support the local Jewish community and to raise funds for the construction of a synagogue in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 1912, the Talmud Torah of Coney Island was organized by a "group of like-minded men," who worked in conjunction with the Sisterhood. The two groups organized a series of fundraisers, and construction of the synagogue commenced in 1917. The building was located at Mermaid Ave. and West 23rd St., and was subsequently demolished in the mid-20th century.</p><p>Sophie Spitzer (born around 1862 in Austria-Hungary), was the primary organizer and first president of the Sea Gate Sisterhood. Her husband, Sigmund Spitzer (born around 1856 in Austria-Hungary), was a founding member of the Talmud Torah of Coney Island, and secretary of that organization.</p>    <list type="ordered">
