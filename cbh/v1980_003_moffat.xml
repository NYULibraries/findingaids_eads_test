    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Abbot Low Moffat collection of Brooklyn photography contains 160 items, including lantern slides, prints, film negatives, and glass negatives. Lantern slides and glass negatives date from the late 19th century while the prints and film negatives date from the early 20th century. Adrian Martense and John Jay Pierrepont appear to be the creators of several slides and negatives in the collection; some slides originate from commercial studios including A.D. Fisk and T.H. McAllister.</p><p>Images in the collection primarily depict houses and street scenes in Brooklyn, N.Y. While many houses are unidentified, the collection also includes images of notable Brooklyn homes, such as the Cortelyou House, the Lefferts House, the Lott House, and the Duryea house. Street scenes are set in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Flatbush, Brooklyn Heights, Coney Island, and Gravesend, and specifically on roads such as Columbia Heights, Fulton Street, and Kings Highway. Images of the Penfield Reef Lighthouse in Connecticut are included along with shots of boats and sailing. Photographs in the collection also show recreation at Prospect Park, monuments at Green-Wood Cemetery, home interiors, and informal portraits.</p>  </scopecontent>
