    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Bar Association was founded in 1872. In the wake of consecutive fraudulent elections in the City of Brooklyn and Kings County, followed by questionable investigations into the elections, many Brooklyn attorneys served on committees which brought about political reform in Brooklyn during the late 1870s. The Brooklyn Bar Association was formed to uphold honor and respectability in the profession, to aid in reforms and the investigation of misconduct, and to encourage positive professional and social relationships among attorneys in Brooklyn. In 1918, the Association moved to 123 Remsen Street in Brooklyn Heights, where it remains as of 2011. Modern activities of the Association include hosting continuing legal education courses and providing a Lawyer Referral Service to the public.</p>  </bioghist>
