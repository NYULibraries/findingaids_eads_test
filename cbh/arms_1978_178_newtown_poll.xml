    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Newtown was the original name by which the Queens neighborhood of Elmhurst was once known. The first European settlement in what is now Queens county was at Maspeth, but was abandoned in 1644. In 1652 another settlement was formed, at first named Middlburgh and renamed Hastings in 1664, but often referred to as the "new town" to distinguish it from the earlier Maspeth settlement. The English made the name Newtown official in 1683 as part of establishing a system of towns and counties. Real estate promotoer Cord Meyer II developed an area north of Newtown in 1895-1896. Not wanting his development to be associated with the pollution of nearby Newtown Creek, he pushed for the area to be renamed Elmhurst.</p>    <list type="ordered">
