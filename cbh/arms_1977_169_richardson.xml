    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>William Richardson (1822-1893) was a prominent post-Civil War resident of Brooklyn. Born in England in 1822, he emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1834 and settled in Ohio. At the age of 18, Richardson moved to Albany, New York, where he worked as a hotel clerk, umbrella maker, and paper hanger. He also became active in the new Republican Party, serving as a member of that party's first state committee. From 1857-1860 he was appointed Clerk to the State Assembly. In 1844 Richardson married Mary Freeman.</p><p>After serving as Army paymaster during the Civil War, Richardson moved to New York City in 1864 to become Superintendent of the Dry Dock, East Broadway and Battery Railroad Company. Shortly thereafter he was elected President of the company. In 1867 Richardson moved to Brooklyn when the opportunity arose to lease the Atlantic
Avenue, East New York and Greenwood Railroad from the Brooklyn Central and Jamaica Railroad. Originally, Richardson obtained a 40 year lease on the line, but in 1872 his holdings were jeopardized when the Brooklyn Central and Jamaica defaulted on its mortgage. However, Richardson was able to secure complete ownership of his line, and he reorganized it as the Atlantic Avenue Railroad Company. He continued to operate the company for two decades, earning a reputation as a hard-working and foresighted businessman. In 1877 Richardson leased his rights to the Atlantic Avenue surface route to the Long Island Railroad. At this time the Long Island Railroad began using steam engines on the route, thus involving Richardson in the controversy over their use within the Brooklyn city limits. Finally, in 1892 Richardson sold the company to the Brooklyn Traction Company.</p><p>As a Brooklyn resident, Richardson remained active in Republican Party activities. Elected to serve two terms as Alderman for Brooklyn's 22nd Ward from 1870-1874, Richardson was active on issues involving water supply, illuminating gas and local improvements for his Ward. As a politician, Richardson was regarded as a lieutenant of Republican boss Benjamin Tracy who was an officer of the Atlantic Avenue Railroad.</p><p>Richardson also served on the Kings County Board of Supervisors. In 1874 as the result of the resignation of the chief medical officers of the Kings County Lunatic Asylum, the Board of Supervisors appointed a Committee of Investigation Relative to the County Institutions. Richardson chaired this committee's inquiries into the conditions of the agencies run by the County Commissioners of Charities. The committee's printed report, issued in December 1874, recommended a few reforms of operating procedures. Upon his death the Brooklyn Daily Eagle eulogized Richardson for his faith in and dedication to Brooklyn's railroads, his honesty, and his active involvement in civic causes.</p>  </bioghist>
