<p>The John H. Prentice mansion was located at 1 Grace Court in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. The mansion was built for John H. Prentice (1803-1881), a businessman and owner of Prentice's Stores, a series of warehouses that were located on the piers that once lined the Brooklyn side of the East River. Prentice served as president of the Brooklyn Board of Water Commissioners, was one of the first Parks Commissioners in Brooklyn, and was treasurer of the Board of Trustees of the East River Bridge (now the Brooklyn Bridge). As of 2011, a condominium building stands where the mansion was located.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
