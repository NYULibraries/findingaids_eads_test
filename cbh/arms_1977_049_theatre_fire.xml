    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Theatre at the corner of Washington and Johnson Streets was one of Brooklyn's first successful legitimate theaters. On the night of December 5, 1876, approximately 1,000 people were watching a popular melodrama, "The Two Orphans." Many were crowded into the modestly-priced upper gallery seats. At 11:15 PM, shortly after the opening of the last act, a fire broke out, apparently caused by scenery touching the gas lights.  The actors urged the audience to remain in their seats, but as the flames grew more noticeable, many rushed for the doors. There were few exits from the galleries, and panic ensued as hundreds rushed for the two narrow stairways.  Many were trampled or collapsed, further jamming the stairs. The theater was destroyed within fifteen to twenty minutes and neither police nor observers at the scene were aware of the large number of people trapped in the building. Firemen were unable to enter the theater until the next morning, when they discovered the large number of bodies. More than 300 lives were lost, and many of the bodies could not be identified. It was the worst common disaster in Brooklyn's history, and the city went into a period of mourning. On Saturday, December 9th, the City of Brooklyn held a public funeral for 100 of the victims who were buried in a mass grave atop Battle Hill in a plot donated by Green-Wood Cemetery. Three crowded memorial meetings were held simultaneously around the city on the following day, with hundreds of mourners unable to enter the meetings.  </p><p>A relief committee took shape as soon as the extent of the tragedy became known, with Mayor Frederick A. Schroeder appointed to receive contributions. Schroeder was assisted by Daniel Chauncey, treasurer, and the Reverend Dr. Alfred P. Putnam as secretary. The Brooklyn Theatre Fire Relief Association raised $47,455.47 to aid the families of the victims, contributions coming from across the nation as the disaster became publicized through newspapers. A committee of prominent citizens dispensed assistance after volunteers visited the homes of families in need and certified their worthiness for assistance. Aid went to 800 individuals in 188 families. Families were removed from the rolls as they no longer needed assistance, and the committee also reduced levels of aid at its discretion. Bi-weekly stipends continued until March, 1879, at which time the funds became exhausted.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Theatre Fire Relief Association Records contain 849 items, all from within the period 1876-1879. They consist chiefly of correspondence directed to either Mayor Frederick A. Schroeder, chairman of the committee, or to the Reverend Putnam, secretary of the committee, and internal documents, including account books and investigative forms filled out by those who visited and vetted relief applicants.</p><p>The relief association records are a unique historical resource.  The volunteer visitors to the homes of recipients filled out forms giving the name, age, address, occupation, and wages of the victim along with information as to family size, rent, health, and other factors that could influence the request for assistance.  These reports provide information about an under-investigated Brooklyn population, many of whom were of working class or lower middle class background.</p><p>There are two major categories of material in this collection: investigations and finances.  Nearly two-thirds of the collection consists of items collected during the investigations of the sufferers.  These include the forms filled out by the volunteer visitors as well as correspondence from the recipients or others pleading their cases.  Approximately one-third of the collection details financial matters of the relief association.  Of these one-half concern the contributions that were received by the association, and the rest involve the expenditure of the funds.  Also included are 85 items from the undertakers who buried the victims of the fire.  In addition, a few items relate to the internal operations of the relief association.</p>  </scopecontent>
