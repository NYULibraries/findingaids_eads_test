    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>The Hook family resided at 1001 Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn. Alfred J. Hook was with the 106th Infantry during World War I and was killed in action in 1918 while helping to break the Hindenburgh Line in Germany. He received the Distinguished Service Cross and was buried in Bony (Aisne), France. His sister, Mary A. Hook, travelled to France in 1920 to visit her brother's gravesite. She wrote a letter to her mother, Katherine E. Hook, which was reprinted in the Brooklyn Eagle on August 15, 1920. The letter caused a sensation and was printed in pamphlet form and distributed throughout the United States in honor of American soldiers buried overseas.</p>  </bioghist>
