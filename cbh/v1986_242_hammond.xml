<p>This collection was rehoused and the finding aid revised by Dee Bowers in 2023. At that time, the collection was renamed; its previous name was "John Farnsworth Hammond, Jr. photograph album and other material." The archivist photocopied the clippings and discarded the originals.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The John Farnsworth Hammond, Jr. collection dates from 1899 to 1939, with the bulk of material dating from 1913 to 1915, and contains 98 items. The majority of the collection consists of a photograph album containing photographic prints and cyanotypes that document sewer construction projects in Brooklyn, Rochester, and Oswego, N.Y., as well as Mifflinburg, PA. Sewer construction photographs show street-level views, laborers, excavations, sewer pipes, dams, and construction equipment such as steam engines and horse-drawn tractors. Brooklyn photographs in the album originate in and around the Gowanus Canal, including the neighborhoods of Gowanus, Cobble Hill, and Carroll Gardens. Photographs in the album were taken by John Farnsworth Hammond, Jr., a contractor associated with the sewer construction projects, and V. Mayhew. Most construction scenes are identified by street name or neighborhood with a description of the image; photographs taken by V. Mayhew are labeled. The album also contains portraits of the John Farnsworth Hammond, Sr. family and rural scenes near their home in Newport, RI. </p><p>In addition to the photograph album, the collection includes a pamphlet titled "Table of Circles from Trautwine's Civil Engineer's Pocket-Book," and two newspaper clippings--an obituary for a sanitary engineer, and a photograph of a horse-drawn plough.</p>  </scopecontent>
