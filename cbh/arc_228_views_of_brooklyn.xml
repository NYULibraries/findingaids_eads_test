    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The <emph render="italic">Views of Brooklyn</emph> viewbooks contain black-and-white non-photographic prints of photographs documenting the built environment in Brooklyn, circa 1905. The viewbooks were published by L. H. Nelson Company of Portland, ME in 1905 and 1910. The original softcovers have been recovered with hardcover library bindings. The hardcovers have become brittle and many of the pages have separated from the bindings. The page size for both viewbooks is 8 x 10. Subjects include church buildings, school buildings, monuments, clubhouses, and bank buildings, among other building types. Views of Prospect Park, Coney Island, and Brooklyn Heights are also well-represented. One viewbook contains 71 images, while the other viewbook contains only 46 images. Digital versions of the images from the viewbook are available via the image database located in the library.</p>  </scopecontent>
