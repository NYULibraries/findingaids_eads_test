    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Knowlton Durham was born on August 29, 1880 in Chicago, Illinois. He was the youngest child of Caleb Wheeler Durham (1848-1910) and Clarissa Safford Welles Durham. He attended Adelphi Academy in Brooklyn, graduating in 1897, and then Columbia University, graduating in 1901. He was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He completed law school, also at Columbia, in 1905. He enlisted in the army in 1912 and served in the first World War. In 1925, he married Pauline Crook Peck. Her son, Robert, became his stepson, but the couple never had children of their own.</p><p>Knowlton's father Caleb Durham was born to Alpha Durham (1805-1851) and Elizabeth Riggs. Alpha Durham was the child of John Durham and Pruella Whitney, and his grandfather was also John Durham (1720-1800). Elizabeth Riggs was born to Silas Riggs and Harriet Rose, daughter of David Rose and Mary Rogers. Caleb Durham was a civil engineer and inventor of the Durham System of Plumbing.</p><p>Knowlton's mother Clarissa Safford Welles Durham (1849-1907) and her sisters Sarah and Mary were born to Henry Woolsey Welles (1818-1860) and Susan Martin Safford Welles. Henry Woolsey Welles was the son of John Welles (1776-1855) and Sarah Rice Hulbert (1806-1868) and the grandson of Rev. Dr. Noah Welles (1718-1777) and Abigail Woolsey (1731-1812). Susan Martin Safford Welles was the daughter of John Safford.</p><p>Knowlton Durham's older brothers were Henry "Hal" Welles Durham (1874-1959), Roger Durham, and Leicester Durham (1877-1933). Henry followed his father into civil engineering. He married Josephine Belden Trowbridge in 1903 and they had one daughter, Elizabeth. Leicester married Viola Ethel "Pansy" Hyde Durham and they had four children: Carol, Richard Hyde, John Dickinson, and Sarah "Sally" Welles.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Accession 1985.021 was originally minimally processed to the collection level. In May 2023, Dee Bowers added accession 2015.037 and reprocessed the collection, including photocopying newsclippings and discarding the originals.</p>  </processinfo>
  <scopecontent id="aspace_99ed660f8a8b000012b52ea5b586e034">
    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Papers mainly relate to the Durham family's ancestry and genealogical record and contain information stretching back to at least 1273, though the majority of the genealogy materials concern individuals living in the 18th through 20th centuries. Other items relate to the professional accomplishments and personal lives of certain Durham family members living in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These latter papers place particular emphasis on Knowlton Durham (b. 1880), a New York City lawyer. Materials in the collection include genealogical research notes and lists, correspondence among members of the Durham family, press releases, obituaries and marriage announcements, newspaper and magazine clippings, and other ephemera. Also included are Knowlton Durham's application to the Sons of the Revolution, including extensive details on his personal ancestry and its connection to the Revolutionary War; the Durham family's coat of arms; and one oversize volume containing records of Fire Prevention at Hook and Ladder Company No. 118 for the period 1938 to 1950, including records of incoming and outgoing documents and daily statistical and inspection records relating to fire prevention in Brooklyn. It is unknown whether the materials in this collection were compiled by a single researcher or multiple individuals, but it is presumed that the compiler(s) were related to the Durham family.</p>  </scopecontent>
