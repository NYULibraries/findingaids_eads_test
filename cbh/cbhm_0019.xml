    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Laura Fitzpatrick was born on October 25, 1927 in Mount Meigs, Alabama. Her family moved to New York when she was ten years old and she started taking photographs with an Agfa Billy camera soon after. Fitzpatrick used the rooftop of her apartment building at 635 Broadway in Williamsburg like a photo studio, taking photographs of friends, family, and neighbors. She married Ernest Evans in 1951 and they had four children, including the donor of this collection, Daniel Evans.</p><p>Fitzpatrick received her nursing degree from the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) School of Practical Nursing at 30 Third Avenue in Brooklyn and she worked at Brookdale Hospital for 33 years. She went back to school in the 1970s for her Registered Nursing (RN) degree.</p><p>In her personal time, Fitzpatrick frequented the Apollo Theater and the Fox Theatre for musical concerts and Broadway theaters. 
 
Fitzpatrick moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina in retirement. She died on March 22, 1987.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection is made up of 409 scanned digital images of original photographs taken by Laura Fitzpatrick from the ages of 11 to 21 (1938-1948). Fitzpatrick's photographs document her family, friends, and neighbors, Black families who were part of the Great Migration from the American South who had recently arrived in Brooklyn. The photographs were taken in Prospect Park, Coney Island, Williamsburg, and Bedford-Stuyvesant as well as some other locations in New York and Washington, DC. The majority of the photographs are black-and-white, with a few hand-colored examples.</p><p>The original camera, an Afga Billy, and scrapbook containing the original photographs were donated to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) in Washington, DC. They were a part of the museum's inaugural exhibition, "Everyday Beauty: Photographs and Films from the Permanent Collection."</p>  </scopecontent>
