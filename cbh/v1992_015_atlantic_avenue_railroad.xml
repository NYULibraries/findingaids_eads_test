    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>In 1939, a project to build a tunnel to depress existing railroad lines that ran along Atlantic Avenue between East New York in Brooklyn and Morris Park in Queens commenced. The project was funded by the City of New York and the Long Island Railroad (LIRR). On November 1, 1939 the LIRR issued a notice that the abandonment of seven train stations (Warwick Street; Autumn Avenue; Union Course; Dunton; Woodhaven; Clarenceville; and Morris Park) and the discontinuance of operation of local electric trains would commence. At this time in the project, they were eliminating grade crossings on the Atlantic Division and installing temporary tracks. The tunnel was completed in 1942.</p>  </bioghist>
