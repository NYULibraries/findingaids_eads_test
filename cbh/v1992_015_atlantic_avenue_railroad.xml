      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>In 1939, a project to build a tunnel to depress existing railroad lines that ran along Atlantic Avenue between East New York in Brooklyn and Morris Park in Queens commenced. The project was funded by the City of New York and the Long Island Railroad (LIRR). On November 1, 1939 the LIRR issued a notice that the abandonment of seven train stations (Warwick Street; Autumn Avenue; Union Course; Dunton; Woodhaven; Clarenceville; and Morris Park) and the discontinuance of operation of local electric trains would commence. At this time in the project, they were eliminating grade crossings on the Atlantic Division and installing temporary tracks. The tunnel was completed in 1942.</p>

      <p>The Atlantic Avenue railroad project photographs consist of 28 black-and-white 8 x 10 inch photographic prints showing views of infrastructure related to both the elevated and street railroad tracks along or near Atlantic Avenue. The photographer was C. V. Beutel and project was directed by A. G. Dengler. All photographs were taken on October 4, 1939. The photographs show views of the Brooklyn neighborhoods of East New York and Cypress Hills and views of the Queens neighborhoods of Woodhaven and Richmond Hill. Though the photography project was intended to document images of infrastructure related to the railroad such as railroad tracks, street ducts, street poles, and aerial cables, the photographs incidentally document street life, buildings, and period automobiles, among other subjects.</p>
