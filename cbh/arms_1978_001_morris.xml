    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Newbold Morris papers are dated 1962 and measure 0.16 linear feet. The papers document New York City and State official response to a severe late winter storm in 1962 that caused considerable damage to property along the Long Island shorefront. The predominant community represented in the collection is Fire Island, but also included are Shirley, Bayshore, Babylon, and the Rockaways. The collection contains photocopies of clippings from several New York City and Long Island newspapers, photographs, and a copy of an act to form a commission to study the property damages and make recommendations for the restoration and protection of the affected area. The committee was dubbed the Temporary State Commission on Protection and Preservation of the Atlantic Shorefront, and its members included Joseph F. Carlino, Chairman, H. Lee Dennison, Vice Chairman, and Robert Moses, Secretary.</p>  </scopecontent>
