    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Ethel M. (Martin) Franks (1907-2000), was born in Millville, New Brunswick, Canada, on February 10, 1907, to Margaret Galloway Maxwell and Percy Harry Charles Martin. She arrived in Brooklyn, New York, around 1926, to attend the Brooklyn Maternity Training School for Nurses at the Prospect Heights Hospital. While attending school she resided at the nurses' residence, which was attached to the hospital. She became a Registered Nurse in 1929. After graduation, she worked as a private and hospital nurse, and was a member of the nursing school's alumni association. She became a United States citizen in 1934. In 1935, she married Harold L. Franks and became a homemaker. In 1942, they moved to Pittsburgh. About 1963, she resumed her nursing career, and was employed by Planned Parenthood, the Head Start program, and the Allegheny County Public Health Department, from which she retired. She died in Miami, Forida, on January 4, 2000.</p><p>- based on information provided by her daughter, Linda Franks Beebe</p>  </bioghist>
