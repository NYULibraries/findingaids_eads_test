    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Michael Molinari photographs of buildings in Gowanus and Flatlands date from circa 1970 to 1989. The collection consists of 24 color photographic prints taken by Michael Molinari. Ten of the photographs depict an abandoned building and parking lot in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn, located on 2nd Avenue between 11th and 12th Streets. The photographer believed the building to be a former stable or car barn. Another ten photographs document a dutch colonial style house, built circa 1905, that was located at the intersection of Avenue N and Flatbush Avenue in the Flatlands neighborhood. The remaining four photographs show exterior views of the now landmarked dutch colonial Stoothoff-Baxter-Kouwenhaven House located at 1640 East 48th Street in Flatlands. The house was built in three stages--in 1747, 1811, and 1880.</p>  </scopecontent>
