    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection includes two handwritten receipt books from members of the Cowenhoven family living in Kings County. The earlier book, dating 1782-1787 is likely the receipt book of Nicholas Cowenhoven (1744-1793). Receipts are for a range of goods and services, including wood, shoe making, beef, mutton, labor, and livestock. Several payments come from the families of early Dutch settlers, including the Lefferts, Bergen, Vanderbilt, Vorhees, Wykoff, Lott, Stillwell, Remsen, Van Pelt, and Van Brunt families. This book includes entries for the sale of Jack, a Black man enslaved by Nicholas Cowenhoven sold to Peter Lefferts on January 26, 1782, and Cuffee, a Black man enslaved by Nicholas Cowenhoven sold to Rutergt A. Van Brunt on behalf of his father, Adrian Van Brunt on July 4, 1785. Entries for "my son Nicholas Cowenhoven" are likely from his mother, Catharina Remsen (1716-1786).  </p><p>A later book belonging to Gerretta Cowenhoven (1763-1863) dates 1814-1830 and includes receipts for a range of goods and services including rent for a home on Maiden Lane, manure delivery, flour, medical care, surveying, repairs, and blacksmith services. An 1823 entry notes Gerretta as executor of the will of Tunis Tiebout (1722-1823).</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Cowenhoven family (alternate spellings include Couwenhoven, Kouwenhoven, and Covenhoven) were descended from the common ancestor Wolphert Gerritson Van Kouwenhoven, who emigrated from the Netherlands to the town of New Utrecht in the Dutch colony of New Netherland (later New York) in the 17th century.  </p><p>Nicholas Couwenhoven (1744-1793) was the great-great-grandson of Wolphert Gerritson Van Kouwenhoven. Nicholas was a lawyer, landowner, and enslaver who married into the Lott family. According to transactions detailed in his receipt book, he and his wife Jannetje Lott (1745-1817) held at least two enslaved Black men in their household, Jack and Cuffee, who were sold by Cowenhoven in 1782 and 1785.  </p><p>Gerretta (Gerritje) Tiebout (1763-1863) married into the Cowenhoven family in 1785. Gerretta's husband John Remsen Cowenhoven (1761-1811) was the nephew of Nicholas Cowenhoven. By the time Gerretta's receipt book was in use she was a widow raising several children. Receipts show an income from renting rooms in a building on Maiden Lane, but it's unclear if this was also her residence. She was buried in the Vechte-Cowenhoven family burying ground.  </p>  </bioghist>
