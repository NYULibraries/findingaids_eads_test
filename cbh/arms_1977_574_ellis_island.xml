    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Ellis Island, an island in Upper New York Bay, is named for Samuel Ellis, who acquired land on the island in 1785.  Purchased in 1808 by the State of New York, the island was then turned over to the federal government, which used it for a time as a fort and arsenal to defend the harbor.  Beginning in 1892, Ellis Island became the site of the federal immigration center.  Between 1892 and 1924, 71 percent of alll immigrants to the United States came through the immigration center at Ellis Island.  In 1924, restrictions  on mass immigration by Congress diminished the role of Ellis Island as an immigration center, and until 1954 it was mainly used as a site to detain deportees.  The island was declared a national monument in 1965, though lack of funds to restore the immigration facilities caused them to deteriorate in the ensuing decades.  Private restoration efforts were begun in the 1980s, and a museum of immigratrion on the island was opened to the public in 1990.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
