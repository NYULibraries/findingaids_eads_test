    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>In 1898, the City of Brooklyn (along with what would constitute the Boroughs of Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx) joined with Manhattan to form New York City. With this consolidation, the individual fire departments of each borough were also joined together under the command of the first Commissioner. This contributed to a reorganization and standardization work conditions and rights for firefighters. The consolidation heralded changes in fire equipment, as well. Previously, fire engines were drawn by horses, and contained only ground ladders. Around 1909, the City of New York began advertising motorized fire engines and pressurized hose wagons, helping to increase efficiency and response time.</p><p>In 1899, the unique identification number of the engines of Brooklyn were changed. 100 was added to the already existing numbers, for example Engine 2 was now 102. This change occurred because the unification of the fire departments of Staten Island, Queens, the Bronx, and Manhattan created Engines with the same identification number.</p><p>Following consolidations, the 31st battalion became part of the 11th Division of the Brooklyn Borough Command. It served the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Fort Greene, Downtown Brooklyn, Boerum Hill, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard.</p><p>Sources:
