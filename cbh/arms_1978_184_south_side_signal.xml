    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The South Side Signal newspaper was founded by Henry Livingston in 1869 and published its first issue on July 7 of that year. Livingston was originally from Duchess County, NY and had previously worked at other newspapers. He married a woman from Babylon, daughter of the town supervisor and one of the town's wealthiest landowners, which probably influenced his decision to settle there. Livingston is credited with publishing the first suggestion that Babylon separate from the town of Huntington. Livingston passed away in 1908, but by then had passed management of the paper to his son, Elbert Carl Livingston, who ran it for a couple of years before selling it to several wealthy residents of Babylon, who operated it until 1920.</p><p>The Signal was a broadsheet paper, published weekly. It was both delivered locally and sent through the mail to subscribers.</p>    <list type="ordered">
