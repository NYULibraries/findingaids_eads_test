    <abstract id="aspace_74fddd318a29fe26c8d0bf1568eb2fd2">This collection consists of correspondence, ephemera, scrapbooks, cartes-de-visite, cabinet cards, and other materials relating to John Blackburne Woodward (1835-1896).  A lifelong Brooklyn resident, Woodward was a notable businessman, military officer, and philanthropist.  He ran a successful trading business, completed his military career as Adjutant General, and served on the boards of many prominent organizations.  The revitalization of both the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences and Prospect Park have been attributed to Woodward's dedicated work.  In 1885, Woodward made an unsuccessful bid for Mayor of Brooklyn. The collection includes material on several organizations that Woodward was engaged in, particularly from the 1860s through the 1890s. These included Johnstown flood relief, the Society of the Army of the Potomac, J. S. T. Stranahan Statue Fund, the 13th Regiment of the National Guard of the State of New York (during the Civil War years), and the Brooklyn Institute. Political campaign ephemera of the 1880s is in the collection. The photographs in the collection are principally of the regimental military officers Woodward served with.</abstract>

<p>The collection was originally processed in February 2008 by Carolyn Vega. As part of this processing, photographs in the collection were removed and described apart from the original collection. The text-based portions of the collection (Series 1 and 2) were fully described and a finding aid published as a PDF. In 2011, Nicholas Pavlik input series-level information for the collection to Archivists' Toolkit to generate a finding aid in html. In 2012, Larry Weimer returned the photographs to the collection, and updated Archivists' Toolkit and the html finding aid to include all collection material.

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>John Blackburne Woodward was born at 84 Sands Street in Brooklyn, N.Y. on May 31, 1835 to Thomas Woodward, who emigrated with his father and brothers from England in 1819, and Mary Barrow Woodward (nee Blackburne).  The family had four daughters and four sons, of whom John was the eldest son.</p><p>Woodward was at school from the ages of 8 to 15, when he entered the importing business of his uncle George Woodward.  In 1859 he moved to the exporting business of Edward Haynes, which traded largely with Brazil and South America.  He became sole proprietor in 1881, and remained at this firm until his death.</p><p>In 1854, Woodward entered the Brooklyn City Guard, 13th Regiment, as a Private.  He steadily rose in rank throughout the ensuing decade, and was elected Colonel of the 13th Regiment in March of 1863.  After resigning as Colonel in June of 1866 Woodward was appointed Major General of the Second Division of the New York State National Guard in March of 1869.  He became Inspector General of New York State in January of 1875, and Adjutant General in April of 1879.</p><p>Acknowledged as an able businessman and conscientious citizen, Woodward also served on the Boards of numerous Brooklyn institutions and committees, many of which were public service oriented.  Woodward's many positions included:</p>    <list type="ordered">

<p>Woodward briefly entered the Brooklyn political stage when, in 1885, he made a bid for Mayor.  He ran as an independent, and had the backing of Seth Low.  During the race, a case was brought against the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph> and others for "preventing the election of John B. Woodward as Mayor."   13,641 ballots were cast for Woodward, but he lost to Whitney's 48,774 and Catlin's 37,945, though he did beat the 879 ballots cast for Funk.</p><p>Woodward resided at 259 Henry Street in Brooklyn with his wife, Elizabeth Cook Blackburne, whom he had married on May 31, 1870, and four children.  Two of Woodward's children, Arthur Harris and an unknown daughter, died in 1890 and 1893, respectively, and two, Robbins Blackburne and Mary ("Mae" or "May") Blackburne,  lived to adulthood.  Robbins went on to have at least one daughter, Mary, named, presumably, for her aunt Mary, who died in the mid 1940s.  Woodward remained at his Henry Street residence until his death in 1896, after a brief decline due to pneumonia.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The John B. Woodward papers consist of correspondence, scrapbooks, photographs, and ephemera created and/or collected by Woodward and his family. The collection includes material on several organizations that Woodward was engaged in, particularly from the 1860s through the 1890s.

No inherent order was evident in this accession upon arrival, and in 2008 it was organized into five subseries: <emph render="bold">Personal Life</emph>, <emph render="bold">Death</emph>, <emph render="bold">Ephemera</emph>, <emph render="bold">Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks</emph>.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Personal Life</emph> subseries consists of correspondence and other materials, including Woodward's school report cards and military notices relating to John N. Woodward.   Very little personal correspondence was accessioned, with the notable exception of an 1861 letter to "Annie," Woodward's future wife.</p><p>
The <emph render="bold">Death</emph> subseries consists of letters of condolence to Mrs. Elizabeth Woodward and clippings of obituaries or death notices from various newspapers in New York State.  Also see Scrapbook 4 for the like, including two brief Brazilian death notices.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Ephemera</emph> subseries consists of clippings, menus, and other ephemera.  The menus and seating charts form the bulk of the subseries, and were collected by Woodward from various dinners he attended.  A portion of the menus contain the autographs of other guests.  Many of the dinners were given by the New England Society or at the Brooklyn Club and/or as "complimentary dinners" to military personnel.  Also see Scrapbook 1 for Brooklyn City Guard and other menus, and see Scrapbook 2 for badges and other ephemera.  </p><p>The <emph render="bold">Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences</emph> subseries consists of material relating to the Institute and collected after Woodward's death, presumably by his daughter Mary.  All clippings mention Woodward, but the bulletin issues do not, with the notable exception of Vol. II, no. 18 (May 29, 1909), the cover of which is decorated by an engraving of Woodward.  </p><p>The <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks</emph> subseries consists of five scrapbooks.  Scrapbooks 1, 2, 3, and 5 were probably compiled by Woodward. Scrapbook 1 dates principally from the 1860s and includes Civil War era orders and other material concerning the New York National Guard's 13th Regiment. Scrapbooks 2 and 3 date mostly from the 1880s and 1890s and concern the organizations and political endeavors that Woodward participated in; political campaign ephemera, including ribbons and badges, are in the books. Scrapbook 5 dates from 1875 and consists of annotated printed clips of city council votes on city works. Scrapbook 4, which consists entirely of clippings relating to Woodward's illness, death, and memorials, was probably compiled by his wife, Elizabeth, or daughter, Mary. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref15_9v4" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 3: Photographs</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1860/1869" type="inclusive">circa 1860-1865</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d7256dffab37c750166f743dbbe6be31"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph> series consists of an album of cabinet cards, an album of cartes-de-visite, and 21 loose cartes.
