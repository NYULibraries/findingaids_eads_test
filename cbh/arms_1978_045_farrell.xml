    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The James Farrell undertaker's account book, dated 1873 to 1900, gives detailed accounts of interment costs for citizens in the borough of Brooklyn in the late 19th century. Also included are notices of deaths from local newspapers (most likely members of Farrell's family), notices of undertaker's meetings, and prices of graves and burials at local cemeteries. Two lists provide Farrell family birth and death dates, presumably those of Farrell's children.</p>  </scopecontent>
