<p>William Irwin Martin (1836-1901) was an envelope manufacturer in the firm Samuel Raynor &amp; Co. (later Raynor &amp; Martin), located at 115 and 117 William Street in New York City. In the Civil War, Martin served in Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg campaign as a member of Company B of the 23rd Regiment of the New York National Guard.  After retiring as an envelope manufacturer in 1892, Martin worked as a real estate broker at 60 Liberty Street in New York.  Martin resided in Brooklyn with his wife, Catharine Clarke, whom he married in 1860, and their five children.  He was a vestryman at Brooklyn's Church of the Messiah and a member of St. Bartholomew's Church in New York.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
