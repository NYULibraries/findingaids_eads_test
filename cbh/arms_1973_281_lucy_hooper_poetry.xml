    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection is made up of a single manuscript containing original drafts of poems composed by Lucy Hooper in the last few years of her life. Many of the original drafts in this volume were published a year after her death in 1841 in a work entitled "Poetical Remains" by her nephew, Reverend Joseph Hooper. This manuscript offers a look into the unedited version of some of Lucy's more well-known poems written in her own hand, such as The Queen's Petition, The Light Afar, and The Last Interview. Lucy made notes about the publication details of individual works, citing The New Yorker, an annual called The Gift, and the American Monthly Magazine, among others. This volume contains the text of the poems with some alteration of lines but no personal annotations. Lucy's poems offer insight into the life of a middle class woman in the early-mid 19th century. Her work is an example of American Romantic Period poetry, with a focus on nature, self awareness, and romantic expression.</p>  </scopecontent>
