    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Academy of Music, one of Brooklyn's premier centers for the performing arts, was founded in 1859 and officially opened in 1861 on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights. After its building was destroyed by a fire in 1903, the Academy moved to a facility on Lafayette Avenue in the neighborhood of Fort Greene, which opened in 1908. In 1936, facing depleted financial resources, the Academy became part of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, with which it remained until the 1970s, when it again became an independent organization.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
