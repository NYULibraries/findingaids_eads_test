    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Coney Island is a neighborhood in southwest Brooklyn, bounded to the north by Coney Island Creek and the Belt Parkway, to the east by Ocean Parkway, to the south by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the west by Norton's Point. It is also home to one of the most famous amusement parks in the world. By the 1960s, the development of high-rise, public housing projects near the amusement district brought a new residential population that was largely African American and Hispanic.</p>    <list type="ordered">
