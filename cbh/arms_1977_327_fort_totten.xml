    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Fort Totten was constructed as a defense for New York City during the Civil War but never saw battle. It was used as a depot for recruits, a camping ground for volunteer units en route combat areas, and also contained hospital facilities. In later years, Fort Totten became the home to the Army Corps of Engineers, the Coast Guard, the U.S. Army Medical Equipment Development Laboratory, and the Army Defense Command. In 1995, Fort Totten was one of the many military bases that were decommissioned.</p>  </bioghist>
