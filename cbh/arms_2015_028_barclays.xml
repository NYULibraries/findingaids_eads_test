    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Barclays Center is a multi-purpose indoor arena complex located at 620 Atlantic Avenue in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  The arena and related development were proposed in 2004, but the project was met with significant community resistance and financing for the building was impacted by the 2009 financial crisis.  Construction began in 2010 and the arena was completed in 2012.  Barclays Center became the home arena for the Brooklyn Nets, a National Basketball League team, in 2012 and for the New York Islanders, a National Hockey League team, in 2015.  Additionally, the arena hosts concerts, conventions, and other sports and entertainment events.</p>  </bioghist>
