    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Joseph V. Lieber photographs of Dutch colonial houses in Brooklyn consist of 78 black-and-white photographic negatives (35mm) and two contact sheets. The photographs are of various Dutch colonial houses, located in Brooklyn, and were taken by Joseph V. Lieber. The photos were made in conjunction with a Brooklyn Arts and Cultural Association (renamed Brooklyn Arts Council in 1987) project called the "Brooklyn Bicentennial Documentation Project." Though Lieber did not identify the subjects of the photographs, the houses were described in a student paper, <emph render="italic">Colonial Dutch Houses of Brooklyn--1976</emph>, written by Lieber while he was an undergraduate at the Polytechnic Institute. Further, some of the houses were identified by James Hurley, the then director of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) at the time of donation.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Dutch colonial houses were built in Brooklyn by early Dutch settlers and their descendants to resemble the architecture of the Netherlands. Dutch colonial houses in Brooklyn are identifiable by their gambrel roofs (typically a symmetrical two-sided roof consisting of two slopes), curved projecting eaves, end chimneys, shingled siding, and south facing entrances. As of 2011, several examples of Dutch colonial houses remain in Brooklyn including the Hendrick I. Lott House located at 1940 East 36th Street in the Marine Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, the Pieter Lefferts House now located in Prospect Park (originally located on Flatbush Avenue near Maple Street in what today would be the Prospect Lefferts Garden neighborhood), and the Pieter Claeson Wyckoff House located at 5816 Clarendon Road at Ralph Avenue in the neighborhood of East Flatbush. All houses are landmarked, while the Wyckoff house holds the distinction as the first building in New York City to be landmarked.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
