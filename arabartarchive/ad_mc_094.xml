    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Ahmad Nawash (1934–2017) was born in Ein Karem, one of the largest Palestinian villages near Al Quds (Jerusalem). His mother passed away when he was seven years old. He was raised by  his father and his stepmother, who was his maternal aunt. He was studying at one of the two elementary schools in Ein Karem when, in 1948, Jewish militias attacked the Palestinian towns and villages and forcefully displaced  the natives. Nawash, who was  14 years old at the time,  left with his father, stepmother, paternal aunt and uncle in the back of a truck to the Palestinian city of Jericho. His family settled there for a few months before relocating to the Jordanian cities of Salt and Marka, then settled in east Amman's Jabal Taj neighborhood. He continued his high school studies while also working as a carpenter. He had three brothers and four sisters. He married his distant cousin in 1966 and continued to live in the same neighborhood before moving to Jabal Hussein around 1985 and to Naʿur in 2003. He had three sons and one daughter.
 
Nawash was drawn into art as a child after painting a portrait of the anti-Crusader hero Saladin. Seeking out training, he landed in a studio of an Italian artist, Armando Prön, resident in the Wadi See area west of Amman. He joined the studio between 1952 and 1953. Prön recognized Nawash's skill and advised him to travel to Italy and pursue professional art training by joining the free classes at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome in 1960. Nawash thus sponsored his own studies, eventually succeeding in joining the studio of Franco Gentilini at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome and obtaining a degree with honors in 1964. He used his time in Italy to visit museums, sketch statues and cathedrals, and practice collage, abstraction, cubism and surrealism. He also undertook a self-guided study of anatomy and filled the walls of his room with large sketches. The collection includes photographs of the artist with colleagues and teachers in Italy, images from the early exhibitions he engaged with, press coverage, and study aid materials on graphic art compiled by students from lecturers and teachers' materials. </p><p>Nawash returned to Amman after his studies and exhibited his oil paintings in solo exhibitions in Amman, Damascus, and Jerusalem. Meanwhile, he enrolled in the Amman Teachers' College and graduated in the class of 1968-1969. He contributed to the art programs at the French Cultural Center in Amman and managed to secure a scholarship to study in France. </p><p>Nawash received a lithography and zinc etching certificate from the School of Fine Arts in Bordeaux, France, 1970. Upon returning to Amman, the artist presented his prints in a series of yearly solo exhibitions at several foreign cultural institutes and the University of Jordan. Nawash later furthered his studies in Paris, working in lithography and zinc etching from 1975 to 1977, and in Florence in 1980, where he also focused on restoring oil paintings. His collection is rich with press clippings that document these phases.
 
During the mid-1990s, Nawash moved to Paris and planned for his family to join him permanently in France. While he was away, his eldest son, Mousa, passed unexpectedly, which prompted Nawash to drop his immigration plan and resettle in Amman. 
 
Nawash was a prolific artist, his work was often on exhibit.  Nawash had solo exhibitions in Rome, Amman, Jerusalem, Baghdad, Damascus, and Paris. He also presented work in major group exhibitions, including the Kuwait Biennale in 1981, where he was awarded a Golden Medal and Appreciation Certificate, 2nd Egyptian International Print Triennial in 1996, the 6th International Cairo Biennale in 1996, and the 5th Sharjah Biennale, Sharjah in 2001.
 
Nawash played an active role in Jordan's  art scene by sharing his knowledge and the experience he gained from his  art training , and by teaching art and contributing to the formation of art curricula in schools. Nawash taught art, painting and art history in the Department of Architecture at the University of Jordan in Amman and painting and art education at the Yarmouk University in Irbid.
 
Nawash received the state recognition award from Jordan in 1990 and an appreciation certificate from the International Biennial of Prints and Drawing, Taipei 1993. His artwork primarily focused on the Palestinian tragedies and acts of resistance, with particular emphasis on the aftermath of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, naming each art piece after an aspect of the Palestinian cause. Major events in this history of struggle against occupation are present in his works collected by museums in the region, including Darat al Funun – the Khalid Shoman Foundation, Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts, Mathaf Museum of Modern Art, Dalloul Art Foundation, Barjeel Art Foundation, and others.</p><p>Ahmad Nawash passed away in Dubai in 2017.</p><p>Dirar Nawash (b.1975) is the artist's youngest son. He takes care of artworks and manages their acquisitions and provenance. He was trained as an engineer and works at Emirates Airlines, Dubai.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>Early in his artistic career, Palestinian Jordanian artist and art teacher Ahmad Nawash (1934–2017) collected documents and newspaper clippings; he often photocopied and inscribed notes on the materials that relate to his artistic practice. The documents of Ahmad Nawash are stored in his studio in the 215 sqm basement of his house in Naʿur area south west of Amman, Jordan. The studio spacious apartment with several  rooms and a kitchen, was a working place for Nawash. He organized his artworks by storing them in an L-shaped open wall unit. A cabinet with the artist's library sits next to  the art pieces in the same room; at the bottom are drawers full of photographs and video tapes, and on the left are cabinets with stacks of exhibition brochures and catalogs. Inside the lower cabinet are copies of magazines, press materials, and teaching materials that Nawash collected as an art instructor or art student.
 
Since the artist passed away in Dubai in 2017, the collection has been in the care of his youngest son Dirar A. Nawash who represents his siblings. </p><p>
In 2021, al Mawrid researcher visited the late artist's studio, assessed the collection of documents, created the inventory and secured an agreement from  his son on loaning the collection to al Mawrid for digitization, cataloging and publishing. The collection arrived at al Mawrid in April 2022, and after digitization returned to its owner in Amman in October 2023.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Processed by researchers and archivists at al Mawrid Arab Center for the Study of Art, including Ala Younis, Ibrahim Mohamed Ali, Dina Taha, Anneka Lenssen, Jonathan Burr, and Jasmine Soliman.</p><p>The arrangement of the materials often reflects groupings established by the artist during his lifetime, such as the files Ahmad Nawash assembled for the  scholarship or residency applications. Such files include grouped correspondence with certificates from different academies. Educational materials were grouped in paper envelopes or folders, many of which carry a handwritten note from the artist indicating they are very important. </p><p>In the case of the press clippings, al Mawrid's researchers organized the loose clippings by decade, from the 1960s to 2000s. Some press clippings are photocopies with notes written  by the artist. In a few instances, the artist had assembled the clippings by pasting them on A4 sheets and binding them in plastic folders without chronological order. This order has been maintained (see Series V.A)</p><p>The materials also included numerous copies of recommendation letters and statements on Ahmad Nawash's work authored by colleagues in Amman and from directors of foreign cultural centers and embassies, namely French and academics including from faculty at the University of Jordan. Similarly, the artist maintained many copies of his resume, sometimes written by hand, some typed, and some photocopied or reproduced digitally. The researchers removed duplicates but retained examples of the variation of the format and technical layout of the content. Nawash also kept photographs from his early exhibitions, and researchers at al Mawrid identified the locations and dates of these exhibitions from the press coverage that matched the content of the images. </p><p>Arab Art Archive finding aids are prepared in both English and Arabic. Researchers seeking to confirm the Arabic spelling of an artist's name are encouraged to consult the Arabic finding aid. In the English-language finding aids, transliterations of Arabic names are guided by al Mawrid policy to use the artist's preferred professional spelling whenever possible. Spellings are checked against artist websites or social media presence (when existent) as well as any available government documents such as a passport or ID. In the case when no such primary documents may be found, spellings are checked with Library of Congress Name Authority File; academic sources such as Modern Art in the Arab World: Primary Documents; Getty Vocabularies / Union List of Artist Names; and in some cases Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World. Al Mawrid Arab Center for the Study of Art maintains an internal Name Standardization Reference List with notes about authoritative sources. 
 
Rather than transliterate Arabic-language titles of documents for the purposes of the English-language finding aid, it was decided for consistency and ease to translate Arabic (and all other language) titles into English. Translated titles and phrases are placed inside square brackets.</p>  </processinfo>
