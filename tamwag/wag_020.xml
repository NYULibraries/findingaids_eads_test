    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Betsy Wade (1929-2020) was a journalist and active member of the Newspaper Guild of New York, Local 3, as well as a founding member of New York Trade Union Women and of the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW). Throughout her career, Wade was an active union organizer, serving as a shop steward, picket captain, and officer in the Newspaper Guild.</p><p>Wade joined <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph> as a copy editor in 1956, making her the first woman to edit news for the publication. She was the first woman editor on the foreign copy desk, as well as the first woman deputy chief of the foreign copy desk, a position which she held during the Vietnam War.</p><p>In the fall of 1972, the Women's Studies Institute of Cornell University, in collaboration with the Region II Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor, held a meeting of labor union staff meetings to discuss issues concerning the role of women in unions. This group, which became known as New York Trade Union Women, began to meet monthly for "brown bag" lunches, and called the first New York Trade Union Women's Conference in January 1974.</p><p>CLUW was founded in March 1974 in Chicago, adopting four basic goals of action: to promote affirmative action in the workplace; to strengthen the role of women in unions; to organize unorganized women workers; and to increase the involvement of women in the political and legislative process. In 1974, Wade was one of seven plaintiffs in a successful class action suit against the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> for gender discrimination. In 1975, New York Trade Union Women became the New York City chapter of CLUW.</p><p>Wade was an active member of the Newspaper Guild of New York, and was nominated by petition both times she ran for the presidency of Local 3 (as-opposed to the union's more usual procedure in which a candidate is nominated by the local's Representative Assembly by a quorum of member representing a certain number of shops). Her election to her second term (which began in 1980) was challenged by the losing candidates, who forced a re-run of the election (supervised by the Department of Labor) in September 1982. Wade did not run for president in this election re-run; instead she ran for membership on the Local's Executive Committee. She and all the members of her insurgent Membership Slate were defeated in this election. In December 1982 Wade also ran unsuccessfully for the office of Local Executive Vice President. Wade also served three times as a regional president of the Guild's International. She ran unopposed for her first term (as was usual in elections for this position), but the elections for her next two terms were contested.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>Coalition of Labor Women.

<p>Decisions regarding arrangement, description, and physical interventions for this collection prior to 2021 are unknown. In 2021, three discrete collections donated by Betsy Wade (Betsy Wade Photographs (PHOTOS 040), the Betsy Wade Files on the Coalition of Labor Union Women (WAG 020), and the Betsy Wade Files on the Newspaper Guild of New York (WAG 045)) were consolidated into a single collection to restore their shared provenance. The Betsy Wade Files on the Coalition of Labor Union Women were transferred to Series I of WAG 020, the Betsy Wade Photographs (PHOTOS 040) were transferred to Series II of WAG 020, and the the Betsy Wade Files on the Newspaper Guild of New York (WAG 045) were transferred to Series III of WAG 020. An accretion of materials concerning labor history walking tours was rehoused, and added to the collection as Series IV. The database records and online finding aids for PHOTOS 040 and WAG 045 were deleted, but researchers can refer to their file versions at the following addresses:</p><p>https://github.com/NYULibraries/findingaids_eads/commits/master/tamwag/photos_040.xml.</p><p>https://github.com/NYULibraries/findingaids_eads/commits/master/tamwag/wag_020.xml.</p><p>https://github.com/NYULibraries/findingaids_eads/commits/master/tamwag/wag_045.xml.</p>  </processinfo>

These materials document a lively struggle between the insurgents and their supporters (variously called the Reponsibility Slate, the Membership Slate, etc.) and the insurgents' opponents (different individuals and slates variously called the Democratic Coalition, the Representative Assembly Slate, the Unity Slate, etc.) at every level of the organization and on practically every issue.</p><p>Throughout the series, which covers a fairly broad spectrum of Guild concerns and activities, and in which are represented all levels of the organization, this conflict is evident particularly in the group of materials concerned with elections and referenda. Here are gathered materials on more than twenty-five elections, referenda, and public disputes that took place in Local 3 in the years from 1978 to 1984. These materials (the bulk of which are campaign literature) demonstrate a chronological picture of the issues and personalities at the core of the conflicts within the Guild.</p><p>Another group of materials in series concentrates on one particular aspect of these conflicts: disagreements at the Guild-wide level over Guild involvement in government-supported or government-sponsored programs in foreign countries. These materials document the struggle, within the Guild over this issue, which began as early as 1967, with revelations of CIA involvement in the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) that resulted in the termination of TNG-AIFLD joint programs, and re-emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the resumption of these programs. Much of this material is drawn from documents gathered by Rose Mary Mechem and given to Betsy Wade, although a significant amount also comes from Wade, who also collected materials on the subject.</p><p>While the majority of this series focuses on the internal struggle in the Guild, it is also documents a broader range of concerns regarding the administration and activities of a labor union. The minutes of the International Executive Board of TNG, of the Executive Committee of Local 3, and the Representative Assembly and General Membership Meeting of Local 3 are particularly useful in this regard (although there are some gaps in this documentation).</p><p>Interfiled throughout the series are handwritten notes, some of which are marginal notations written directly onto various documents (such as meeting agendas) that record, for example, whether Wade attended a particular meeting or when and how many copies of a leaflet were distributed. Others, however, are far more extensive: personal minutes, for example, of meetings, and notes on telephone conversations, with some dialog recorded verbatim. On occasion these notes are separate individual documents, but more often they are written on the front or back of preexisting documents such as leaflets. Most of these notes appear to be in Wade's hand. A sample of Wade's handwriting is included in the appendices, to assist the researcher in making this determination.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_3987c5bf95a9ea511f0ec0f1bf8e03b2"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged in alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_9a5f2d7d6b6bb7182808850aab20f0e9" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) -- Clippings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1966/1967" type="inclusive">1966-1967</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
