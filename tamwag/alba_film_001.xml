<p>The materials consist of 16mm films, videotapes in various formats, and DVDs collected by the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives on the subjects of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and the Spanish Civil War. They include film footage shot in Spain ca.1937-1938 by Harry Randall for the Photographic Unit of the Fifteenth International Brigade; an 18-minute 1937 documentary entitled "With the Lincoln Brigade in Spain," produced by Herbert Kline, directed by Henri Cartier-Bresson, and shot by Cartier-Bresson and Jaques Lemare; "Refuge," (1939) a 27-minute documentary  film about exiled Spanish Republicans in refugee camps in France that was directed by Jean-Paul Le Chanois (aka Jean-Paul Dreyfus) and combines newsreels and original footage (including sequences shot with a hidden camera); and an episode of a 1978 television documentary series "Between the Wars: The Spanish Civil War," hosted by journalist Eric Sevareid.</p><p>The footage shot by Randall includes soldiers (presumably Abraham Lincoln Brigade members and possibly Spanish soldiers as well) at the front and behind the front lines, marching, training, and relaxing, Spanish peasants planting, and scenes of war-caused destruction.  "With the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in Spain" documents Brigade members in Spain, training near the front, waiting to be mobilized, wounded, and at hospitals. It includes close-ups of Brigade members, the nurses who treated them, and local residents Brigaders met while recovering from their wounds, as well as scenes of Madrid during the fall of 1937, and a soccer game in Benicassim. </p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The materials in this collection were acquired by the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA)—a non-profit organization devoted to preserving the memory of the volunteers who fought against fascism and to defend the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War.  ALBA first donated a low-resolution VHS tape of a video transfer of 16mm footage shot by Harry Randall, a member of the Lincoln Brigade, in 1937-1938 (the Library created a screening copy of this VHS); ALBA then donated the balance of the materials to the Tamiment Library in 2009.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>The Spanish Civil War (1936 – 1939) was a conflict between the newly-elected left-leaning government of the Spanish Republic and its supporters and the (ultimately successful) rebellion against the Republic led by General Francisco Franco and supported by Hitler and Mussolini. Thousands of men and women from around the world volunteered to serve as soldiers and medical and support personnel for the Republic, which organized them into International Brigades (including the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, made up of North Americans).  Film was one of the weapons used by international organizations supporting the Republic and the Brigades to document the war and to generate support and raise money; after the war they used moving images to aid the Republic's refugees.</p><p>The major works in the collection include "With the Lincoln Brigade In Spain", directed by Henri Cartier-Bresson; footage shot by in Spain ca.1937-1938, by Harry Randall, head of the Photographic Unit of the Fifteenth International Brigade (which functioned as the photographic arm of the Lincoln Brigade); and "Refuge."</p><p>"With the Lincoln Brigade In Spain," is a short documentary film produced by Herbert Kline, directed by still photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, and shot in 35mm (although distributed in 16 mm) by Cartier-Bresson and movie camera operator Jaques Lemare. It was filmed in 1937 and released in 1938. Shown in union halls, clubs, and other small venues throughout the United States, "With the Lincoln Brigade in Spain" was used to raise funds to bring the Brigaders home. (At the same time that it was shooting "With the Lincoln Brigade in Spain," the same production team was shooting another Lincoln Brigade-related documentary film in Spain--"Return to Life"--for the American Medical Bureau of the North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy in Spain (AMB)). "Refuge," was shot in 1939, to publicize the plight of Spanish Republican refugees in refugee camps in France and the deplorable conditions in these camps.  It was produced by Cine Liberte and the AMB, directed by Jean-Paul Le Chanois (aka Jean-Paul Dreyfuss), and edited by Irving Lerner. It includes footage from (and may be a shortened version of) "Un peuple attend," another documentary on the same subject shot earlier that year, and also directed by Le Chanois.</p><p>
