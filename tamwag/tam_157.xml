    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Abraham Unger (1899-1975) was a lawyer, Communist, a founder and officer of the National Lawyers Guild and leader of its New York City Chapter, and beginning in 1948, partner in the law firm of Freedman and Unger. His defendants included the Communist Party USA, various state-level Party organizations, individual Communists and progressive activists, radical and/or Communist-associated labor unions and their leaders and activists, Puerto Rican nationalists, and fellow lawyers charged with contempt and other crimes in connection with their defense of radicals. 
Unger was a graduate of the New York University Law School. As a member of the International Labor Defense, he took part in the preparation of the defense of nine young African American men convicted of rape in Scottsboro, Alabama in 1931. Unger also defended the first twelve Communist Party USA top leaders indicted under the Smith Act in 1949 (for conspiring to advocate the violent overthrow of the U.S. government), and was himself indicted for contempt in 1953 for refusing to answer questions from Senator Joseph McCarthy before the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, including whether or not he headed the Party's section for professionals. Unger also defended Puerto Rican nationalist Juan Bernardo Lebron who was charged as a conspirator in the 1954 attack on the US House of Representatives, and petitioned for the commutation of Oscar Collazo's life sentence for his 1952 attempted assassination of Harry Truman.</p>  </bioghist>

writings, and correspondence related to Abraham Unger's work in support of individuals involved in the movement for Puerto Rican independence. These materials primarily relate the cases of Puerto Rican Independence Movement members Oscar Collazo and Juan Bernardo Lebron. Unger served as Callazo's defense attorney after Callazo and an associate attempted to assassinate President Harry Truman in 1950. Unger also served as council for Lebron who was brought on conspiracy charges for his connection with an attack on the US House of Representatives in 1954. Lebron was charged along with several other defendants, but was the only defendant represented by Unger. Materials related to Lebron's case primarily consist of legal briefs, Unger's notes, and correspondence between 1954 and 1955. The collection also contains general clippings and articles related to Puerto Rico and the independence movement and its leader Pedro Abizu Campos. Other materials in this donation include incoming letters to Unger (1948-1957), planning materials from the 17th Annual Communist Party National Convention, and articles related to communism and human rights.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_0a49c5c18ff21f3f38a0193e54ec2249" level="file"><did><unittitle>Research Materials on Puerto Rico and Puerto RIcan Political Prisoners</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1950/1966" type="inclusive">1950-1966</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_8cb2064f4891513e64d10fde354d6598" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856490]" type="Box">11</container><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_42c7f77a2e56374b80ab15abd1fd2659" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856524]" type="Box">14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_64e2beae74795b9d8ad1d74385a42744" level="file"><did><unittitle>General Articles and Bulletins on Communism and Socialism</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1948/1980" type="inclusive">1948-1980</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_941243b7620a21dba171ffb9d64aef45" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856490]" type="Box">11</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_30b5711df7500b08f08b7591ef5b9bec" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856516]" type="Box">13</container></did></c><c id="aspace_9b445efa3203d8ffecbc8f5015e9bf36" level="file"><did><unittitle>Oscar Collazo Clemency Petition</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1948/1972" type="inclusive">1948-1972</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_cbcc6cffb9951a3eb6df316f9d51b20f" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856490]" type="Box">11</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_8d32ec12bb34c27cd5d637a6465920e9" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856508]" type="Box">12</container></did></c><c id="aspace_5a08df18963d9793a6984f606abf376d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Juan Lebron Defense in United States vs. Lebron</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1953/1959" type="inclusive">1953-1959</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_4c9632307f254cd44c5016d269d89b7b" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856508]" type="Box">12</container></did></c><c id="aspace_2a10238ede6b6e7b01c076431ff7a960" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pedro Abizu Campos and the Puerto Rican Independence Movement</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1952/1976" type="inclusive">1952-1976</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_93c2aee41c842ef9ca9b69787220fb8a" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856508]" type="Box">12</container></did></c><c id="aspace_bd5df4f2a2b36c4c3c7c593f41d49165" level="file"><did><unittitle>Communist Party 17th National Convention</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1959/1960" type="inclusive">1959-1960</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_970ccb25dda4e62d478d24762fa1ec57" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856516]" type="Box">13</container></did></c><c id="aspace_fd8b74b740b58717edcfb646d7429a95" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letters to Abraham Unger</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1948/1957" type="inclusive">1948-1957</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_6c79d5d2738e72c5de91c55758e69fe2" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856516]" type="Box">13</container></did></c><c id="aspace_4af6ae34e9f5a05d0d801d415bab6ba7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Articles on World Peace through Law</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1956/1964" type="inclusive">1956-1964</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_ff637fd1d0c411a4c453e2acba6733a3" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856516]" type="Box">13</container><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_af3ab58d7035a67595a4692ffea91a75" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856524]" type="Box">14</container></did></c></c></dsc>
