    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>John Pittman (1906-1993), an African-American communist journalist, was born in Atlanta, graduated from Morehouse College, and received an M.A. in Economics (1930) from the University of California at Berkeley, with a thesis titled "Railroads and Negro Labor." After a brief stint at Stanford Law School, and jobs as a waiter on the Southern Pacific Railroad and as secretary to art patron Noel Sullivan, in October, 1931 he founded and served as editor of the <title render="italic">San Francisco Spokesman</title> (a weekly newspaper for the Bay Area African American community), which by 1934 had been renamed <title render="italic">The Spokesman</title>, reflecting Pittman's broader ambitions and leftward political evolution. During that year's San Francisco general strike, he lent <title render="italic">The Spokesman's</title> printing presses to the fledgling Communist Party newspaper, the <title render="italic">Western Worker, </title>resulting in their destruction by right-wing vigilantes. Then Pittman went to work for the <title render="italic">Western Worker,</title> becoming by 1941 the editor of its successor, the (daily) <title render="italic">People's World.</title> In this capacity, he was a frequent guest on radio station KSAN (San Francisco) in 1941-1942.</p><p>In 1945 he covered the founding conference of the United Nations, and in 1946 received his divorce from his first wife Merle Nance Pittman. In 1947 Pittman traveled to Europe as a correspondent for the Communist Party's newspapers <title render="italic">Daily Worker</title> (New York) and <title render="italic">People's World</title>, and for the <title render="italic">Chicago Defender</title>, a trip made possible by progressive notables including Lena Horne, Paul Jarrico, Albert Maltz, and Dalton Trumbo, whose financial support was coordinated by Los Angeles attorney Leo Gallagher. After his return he married fellow communist Margrit Adler, a German-Jewish antifascist refugee and German-American political activist. They remained in New York until 1955, when they moved to San Francisco with their two children, Carol and John Peter. There Pittman again worked for the <title render="italic">People's World</title>. From 1959-1961 the Pittmans were Moscow correspondents for the CPUSA press. In 1968 Pittman came to New York to become the founding co-editor of the <title render="italic">Daily World</title> (the result of the merger of the Party's West and East Coast weekly newspapers). In the late 1970s Pittman went to Prague as the Party's representative on the editorial board of the <title render="italic">World Marxist Review</title>, returning to New York in 1987. In addition to his newspaper writings, Pittman contributed some two dozen articles to the Party's monthly journal <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>, and wrote <title render="italic">Africa Calling, Isolate the Racists: The Liberation Struggle in Southern Africa</title>(1973), and (with Margrit Pittman) <title render="italic">Sense and Nonsense About Berlin</title>(1962) and <title render="italic">Peaceful Coexistence: Its Theory and Practice in the Soviet Union</title>(1964).</p><p><emph render="bold">Selected Bibliography (arranged chronologically):</emph> </p><p><bibref><title render="italic">Railroads and Negro Labor.</title>Thesis (M.A. in Economics)--University of California, Berkeley, Dec 1930. 92 leaves.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"A Perspective for Forging Negro-White Unity." <title render="italic">Communist</title>23 (Jan, Feb 1944): 86-91, 174-181.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"The Negro People Spark the Fight for Peace." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>25 (Aug 1946): 724-733.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"War on Korea: Point IV in Action." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>29 (Aug 1950): 40-50.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"Africa and the United States." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>37(Feb 1958): 48-52.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"Books in Review: The Diplomacy of World War II." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>37 <title render="italic"/>(Apr 1958): 46-53.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"The October Revolution and National Liberation." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>46 (Nov 1967): 27-38.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"Book Reviews: Toward Eradication of Colonialism." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>47 (Feb 1968): 90-97.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"Laos: Testing Ground of the Nixon Doctrine." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>49 (Oct 1970): 11-19.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"Indochina's 25 Year Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>50 (Feb 1971): 1-13.</bibref> </p><p><bibref><title render="italic">Africa Calling, Isolate the Racists: The Liberation Struggle in Southern Africa.</title>New York: New Outlook Publishers, 1973. 31 pp.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"Arena of Class Struggle: The United Nations, Part I." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>52 (Mar 1973): 18-29.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"Arena of Class Struggle: The United Nations, Part II." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>52 (Apr 1973): 31-40.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"A Guiding Ideology for Anti-Racist, Anti-Monopoly Struggle." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>52 (Aug 1973) 18-30.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"The United Nations and the Struggle for Détente." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>53 (Oct 1974): 44-54.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"Building the Communist Press." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>54 (Mar 1975): 24-37.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"What's New in Soviet Agriculture." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>54 (Jul 1975): 3-20.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"Book Reviews: A Man of Heroic Mold." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>55 (Feb 1976): 54-64.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"The Bonn Congress of the German Communist Party." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>55 (Jun 1976): 24-34.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"From Cradle of Bourgeois Freedom to State Monopoly Capitalism." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>55 (Jul 1976): 7-9.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"Racism and War." <title render="italic">Political Affairs</title>57 (May 1978): 22-27.</bibref> </p><p><bibref>"Afro-American Struggle Today -

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The bulk of the collection is comprised of John Pittman's writings and correspondence.  The writings deal with the struggles of African Americans and people of color worldwide, the strategy and tactics of the communist movement and its relationship to the capitalist powers and developing countries; they consist mainly of typescripts, clippings, and photocopies of Pittman's columns and newspaper articles, pamphlets, papers and radio addresses.  Correspondence includes letters from family members, friends, U.S. and foreign Communist cadre, and African American journalists, writers, activists, and public figures.  </p><p>The collection also contains a small amount of biographical and visual materials, as well as materials documenting Pittman's political activities.  Biographical materials include documents that pertain to Pittman's mother, Carrie Badger Pittman, and the Badger family, school records, and press credentials; materials on political activities include internal Communist Party documents and some of Pittman's notes on meetings, materials related to a course taught at the Jefferson School of Social Science (an adult education institution of the Communist Party USA located in New York City), and a file of documents relating to the Democratic Party of California in the elections of 1932.  Visual materials include photographs--of Pittman, his family and friends-- documenting both personal and professional activities, and a handful of graphics and printing plates for Communist Party publications.</p>  </scopecontent>

Most of the materials in it are photographs (mainly black and white), unless otherwise indicated.  Among the photographic portraits of Pittman and his relatives and friends are a late nineteenth/early twentieth century group photograph that includes his mother, Carrie Badger Pittman, and an early twentieth-century portrait of a man with a close resemblance to Pittman, who may be Pittman's father.  Images shot in the Soviet Union (including Pittman at Red Square in front of Lenin's tomb with other dignitaries, and commercial photographs of various tourist spots in Moscow at night, such as the Kremlin lit by floodlights) and in Prague were probably shot at the same time as John and Margrit Pittman's stint as Moscow correspondents for the <emph render="italic">People's World</emph> and John Pittman's time on the editorial board of <emph render="italic">World Marxist Review</emph>.  On the other hand, the small number of images from Mexico (shot by <emph render="italic">People's World</emph> photographer Elmer Allen) do not seem to have come from any journey that Pittman himself  took; similarly there are a handful of photographic images of various persons with whom (with the likely exception of Angela Davis) Pittman was not personally acquainted, ranging from Lyndon Baines Johnson to an image of Le Quang Vinh  (leader of the independent Hòa Hảo army of Vietnam that fought against the Viet Minh and who was imprisoned and executed by the government of South Vietnam).  Graphics and realia include a small print of a New Masses logo, and plates and mat molds for the title and accompanying photograph of Pittman for his weekly column in the <emph render="italic">People's World</emph>, "The World This Week."</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref349" level="file"><did><unittitle>Graphics - Communist Campaign Poster from Great Britain</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1969" type="inclusive">ca 1960s</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_31692a11a89e64649fb4c8c767c765a4" label="Graphic Materials [31142062838852]" type="Box">Shared Tamiment A006</container><container parent="aspace_31692a11a89e64649fb4c8c767c765a4" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref341" level="file"><did><unittitle>Graphics - Print (lithograph?) and Newspaper Clipping </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1930/1949" type="inclusive">ca 1930s-1940s</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_c68b9aa7cb179b601c001ac406efe11b" label="Graphic Materials [31142062838852]" type="Box">Shared Tamiment A006</container><container parent="aspace_c68b9aa7cb179b601c001ac406efe11b" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref342" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mexico - Fishers and Peasants</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1963/1963" type="inclusive">1963</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_1ef89c890b0a34f128bad67de0ade51e" label="Mixed Materials [31142062838852]" type="Box">Shared Tamiment A006</container><container parent="aspace_1ef89c890b0a34f128bad67de0ade51e" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref343" level="file"><did><unittitle>Portraits – John Pittman</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1979" type="inclusive">ca 1960s-1970s</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_167752b28ff3edba9d613fc97fce5bc1" label="Mixed Materials [31142062838852]" type="Box">Shared Tamiment A006</container><container parent="aspace_167752b28ff3edba9d613fc97fce5bc1" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref338" level="file"><did><unittitle>Portraits and Snapshots - John Pittman's  Friends and Relatives </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1880/1979" type="inclusive">ca 1880s-1970s</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_11f701fab1eaeee540ba73d39aa2abd1" label="Mixed Materials [31142062838852]" type="Box">Shared Tamiment A006</container><container parent="aspace_11f701fab1eaeee540ba73d39aa2abd1" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref339" level="file"><did><unittitle>Portraits of Others - United States President Lyndon Baines Johnson, Karl Marx, Le Quang Vinh (Vietnamese prisoner), Angela Davis</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1870/1979" type="inclusive">ca 1870s, 1960s-1970s</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_5abb46ed1d26996eab2691bb7d80dd7c" label="Mixed Materials [31142062838852]" type="Box">Shared Tamiment A006</container><container parent="aspace_5abb46ed1d26996eab2691bb7d80dd7c" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref346" level="file"><did><unittitle>Realia: Printing Plates and Mat Molds</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1936/1939" type="inclusive">ca 1920s-1930s</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_78e6a76437d588283d65de63de03e114" label="Realia [31142062838852]" type="Box">Shared Tamiment A006</container><container parent="aspace_78e6a76437d588283d65de63de03e114" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref340" level="file"><did><unittitle>Soviet Union - Moscow </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1959/1961" type="inclusive">ca 1959-1961</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_57a633f33065ff82701f4645344e91ef" label="Mixed Materials [31142062838852]" type="Box">Shared Tamiment A006</container><container parent="aspace_57a633f33065ff82701f4645344e91ef" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref344" level="file"><did><unittitle>Unidentified – Group of People Posed in front of a Monument (statue of a soldier), Location Unknown (probably in Eastern Europe)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1965/1969" type="inclusive">ca 1960s</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_0643f9a6328ed3806eee79152f323814" label="Mixed Materials [31142062838852]" type="Box">Shared Tamiment A006</container><container parent="aspace_0643f9a6328ed3806eee79152f323814" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref345" level="file"><did><unittitle>Unidentified - Meeting in Prague;
