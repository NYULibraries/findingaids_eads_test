<p>During processing in 2020, original folders were retained whenever possible. Where appropriate, materials were rehoused in archival folders. If original folder titles are available, they were transcribed onto the new folder with descriptive enhancements by the archivist as necessary. If the original folder was kept, loose labels were stapled to ensure accurate titling and prevent loss of information. Loose paper materials were placed in archival folders with descriptive titles by the archivist. In February 2020, mold-damaged and out-of-scope materials were deaccessioned. Two optical disks were identified and inventoried, and forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit.</p><p>New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content.</p><p>In 2021, narrative description in the Series I scope note was edited to more accurately describe the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II.</p><p>Researchers can access previous versions of the finding aid in our GitHub repository at https://github.com/NYULibraries/findingaids_eads/commits/master/tamwag/wag_325.xml.</p>  </processinfo>

Materials include correspondence, memos, press releases, newspaper clippings, statements, flyers, event programs, invitations, mailers, brochures, speeches, schedules, and meeting notes. In addition to these types of materials, Chin's own run for city council representative is also documented by completed candidate questionnaires and surveys, printed campaign literature, printouts of digital photographs, a campaign banner, and photographic contact sheets. Rocky Chin was a delegate at the 1996 and 2000 Democratic National Conventions, and supported Barack Obama's presidential candidacy in 2008, but the materials he collected from these roles are included in the Activism series, since it does not appear that he had a larger role in the campaigns.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_2b59ad24d8baea756f5d19f5e8c35618" level="file"><did><unittitle>Asian Americans for David Dinkins</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1985/1992" type="inclusive">1985-1992</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
