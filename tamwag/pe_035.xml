The collection consists of printed ephemera such as event fliers, brochures, leaflets, pamphlets, and other publications, with the bulk of the materials dating from the early 1960s--when Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) operated under the auspices of the League for Industrial Democracy--through the 1970s. The collection documents the activities of the national organization and various local and regional SDS chapters, with materials that chronicle the group's strategic initiatives, actions, and the relationship between local chapters and the surrounding communities. The collection also contains pamphlets and publications from SDS-sponsored and allied projects, with a large amount of material from the Radical Education Project.</abstract>

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was a radical student group born from the Student League for Industrial Democracy (SLID), which was the student branch of the League for Industrial Democracy (LID), a social democratic organization. The group was expelled from the LID in 1965 and gained national prominence in the late 1960s as the Students for a Democratic Society. </p><p>In 1962, SDS held its first national convention in Port Huron, Michigan, where the membership adopted the eponymous "Port Huron Statement" as its political manifesto. The manifesto was drafted by Tom Hayden, but convention members helped craft it into its final form. While not pro-Soviet Union, SDS did not take an anti-communist approach in their organizing activities. This issue led to trouble with the League for Industrial Democracy and an eventual split from the parent organization. SDS organized around numerous issues, including opposing the Vietnam War, the draft, and participatory democracy. In April 1965, SDS organized the March on Washington opposing the war in Vietnam, which drew tens of thousands of people and situated SDS nationally as one of the primary organizations of the New Left. Organizing around civil rights issues, SDS was inspired by the work of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. SDS was primarily a campus organization, but began to spread to more community-oriented projects like the Economic Research and Action Project and Chicago JOIN projects. </p><p>During 1968, SDS experienced increased factionalism involving Progressive Labor (PL) members and the RYM I (Revolutionary Youth Movement) group, which advocated for a more student-oriented, militant, counter-cultural program. The June 1968 SDS National Convention was full of discord. PL supporters gained policy victories that stressed attempts to gain working-class support, but RYM I and other non-committed delegates continued to dominate the organization's leadership positions. SDS persevered and remained in the center of student protests like the Columbia University strike in the spring of 1968 and the activities at the Democratic National Convention that summer in Chicago. </p><p>After being at the forefront of the New Left during the 1960s, internal pressures surfaced again at the June 1969 National Convention. SDS split into three factions: PL, Weathermen, and RYM II. This latter group, composed of diverse, moderate SDSers, collapsed within a year due to its inability to develop a coherent activist program. The Weathermen, which included many of the national leaders and staff members, sought to initiate an immediate revolution; within six months, the organization had gone underground and its leaders were wanted in connection with mob violence and bombing. SDS-PL continues today as an off-shoot of the Progressive Labor Party.</p>  </bioghist>

These files document the national and local activities of SDS, identifying the ideologies of the group and showing how chapters interpreted and deployed the national organization's strategic initiatives in local communities. There are fliers for regional conferences, meetings, film screenings, sit-ins, teach-ins and strikes, as well as for more well known events like the 1965 March on Washington against the war in Vietnam. As the SDS was affiliated with the League for Industrial Democracy in the early 1960s, files from this period hold memoranda and correspondence from the parent organization.</p><p>This series contains several files of pamphlets and publications that discuss the group's position on social and civic issues, including racial and socioeconomic inequality in the United States, and the influences of inequality on the Vietnam War draft. The authors are primarily past presidents, vice-presidents or executive secretaries. Pamphlets and publications are arranged first chronologically and then alphabetically based on either prominent subject or author. </p><p>In addition to the printed matter that was put out nationally, material, if identified, is organized under local chapter or region. There are files from Amherst College, Harvard/Radcliff, Columbia University, New York University, Brooklyn College, Queens College, Stanford University, Yale University and the Madison, Wisconsin Branch, as well as the New England and New York Regionals. The files show the wide range of issues that concerned campus chapters, such as racial injustice in the community; wage inequality and layoffs in large local employers; disputes over course offerings and university initiatives; and the overarching issues of the national organization, such as protesting the Vietnam War. Local and regional chapter files may also contain chapter histories and campus or community news clippings that contextualize the environment in which the chapter was formed and in which it operated. Meeting minutes and publications of individual committees illuminate how the local chapters were goverened. Circular letters and fliers produced by the chapters also document dissonance  between local chapters and the national organization.</p><p>This series contains a few subject files with publications, pamphlets, fliers, and circular letters on major activities of SDS: anti-draft and anti-Vietnam War organizing, women's liberation and the organizations' joint civil rights work with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Subject files provide a broad view of how SDS approached the core issues of its concern through both education and action. The splits that occurred within SDS at the 1969 National Convention in Chicago involving Progressive Labor and the Revolutionary Youth Movement II are documented in subject files.</p><p>Projects sponsored by or allied with SDS are documented in this series as well. These projects include Chicago JOIN, the Economic Research and Action Project (ERAP), the Liberal Study Group, the Peace Research and Education Project, and the Worker Student Alliance. These files contain source materials SDS assembled or created to provide the intellectual basis for project goals and actions: background papers, conference working papers, bibliographies, and reprinted articles, which were distributed for educational outreach and constituency building. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref7" level="file"><did><unittitle>1960 Conference for Human Rights in

publications distributed by the Radical Education Project, a sponsored project of the SDS. The Radical Education Project was created for internal education in the New Left movement as well as outreach to members of society at large, and its publications were intended to provide an intellectual support to the programs and theories of the movement. While many of the subjects mirror those covered in general SDS publications (such as women's liberation and draft resistance), the Radical Education Project Publications are broader in scope than SDS publications found in Series I, and were intended to be distrubuted to a larger audience than the SDS membership. </p><p>The pamphlets and publications are arranged by subject. This series also contains literature lists, circular letters and memoranda, reports and proposals and brief introductions to the Radical Education Project in the form of brochures and pamphlets. The pamphlets in this series are generally published out of Ann Arbor, Michigan, but occasionally out of Detroit. This series contains one file of material from the Bay Area Radical Education Project, based out of San Francisco, CA.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref147" level="file"><did><unittitle>About and
