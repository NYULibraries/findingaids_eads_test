      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>George Harrison (1915-2004) was a socialist and revolutionary Irish Republican who spent his life supporting the causes of oppressed peoples.  Harrison was born in Shammer, Kilkelly, County Mayo, Ireland on May 2, 1915.  As a youth he served in the East Mayo Brigade of the Irish Republican Army during the Irish Civil War (1922-1923).  He immigrated to the United States in 1938 and served as an infantryman in the United States Army in the Pacific Theater of World War II.  In 1948 Harrison began working as an armored car guard with Brinks, Inc. but was suspended in 1981 because of criminal charges filed against him.</p>
      <p>Harrison was arrested on June 23, 1981 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for violations of federal firearms laws.  He, along with four others, was charged with running guns to the Provisional Irish Republican Army in the high-profile <emph render="italic">U.S. vs. Harrison, Falvey, Mullen, Gormley, and Flannery</emph> case argued in the Eastern District of New York Federal Court.  Frank Durkan, also from County Mayo and a nephew of New York City lawyer and politician Paul O'Dwyer, represented Harrison, acknowledging that Harrison had shipped guns to Republicans in Ireland but arguing that American's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was complicit in the act.  He was acquitted in 1982 and subsequently reinstated by Brinks with back pay in accordance with the order of a federal labor arbitrator (see folder <emph render="italic">Local 807 IBT vs. Brinks</emph>).  </p>
      <p>He retired from the company in the mid-1980s, but remained active in political causes, including opposition to racism and apartheid, as well as providing aid to Palestinians, Chileans, and other victims of poverty or injustices.  Through his life, Harrison was active in many charitable endeavors, like providing funds to build a new parish church in his native town during the 1950s.  He supported Irish American organizations that advocated the union of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland, and came to the aid of Irish Republican prisoners held in the United States, Ireland, or Great Britain.  He supported socialist political causes, but was also active in the New York City mayoral campaign of David Dinkins and the presidential campaigns of Jesse Jackson and Bill Clinton.</p>
      <p>George Harrison died at his home in Park Slope, Brooklyn on October 6, 2004.</p>

          <p>Materials in this series include minutes, financial records, correspondence, and memoranda concerning a variety of domestic, Irish, and international political organizations Harrison belonged to, including Hands Off Cuba Coalition, the National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, and the Committee in Solidarity with Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.  Although international in scope, much of the material documents Harrison's involvement with Irish and Irish American organizations, including his speech at a New York H-Block Armagh Committee rally; his work with the National Graves Association to provide memorials for Irish Republicans; his association with Republican Sinn Fein (also known as Sinn Fein Poblachtach), including letters from organizer Daithi O'Connell; his affiliation with the Irish American Defense Fund, which raised money during the 1980s for the legal defense of Irish Republican sympathizers facing criminal trial and deportation proceedings in American courts.</p>

          <p>This series consists of t-shirts, approximately 200 buttons, and other material objects acquired by Harrison beginning in the 1970s documenting anti-apartheid efforts in South Africa; anti-war and disarmament; and liberation movements in Ireland, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Namibia, Palestine, Korea, and Cuba. The buttons also reflect Harrison's support for organized labor and union strikes, notably that against Eastern Airlines, and American political campaigns, including Jesse Jackson and David Dinkins.  Posters and artwork commemorating members of the Irish republican movement from the 18th century through the 20th century, the 60th anniversary of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Harrison's membership in the Wolfe Tone and the Ninety Eight Memorial Association, and the Michael Flannery Memorial Award.</p>
          <p>Items added to this series in 2017 date from 1988 to 1992 and include posters related to liberation movements in South Africa, Cuba, Latin America, and Palestine, and anti-nuclear disarmament. They also include pieces of memorabilia including a ticket-stub from a 1991 Nelson Mandela rally in New York City.</p>
