    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In 1911, the Union Label Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor chartered the Central Union Label Council of New York City. Like its parent body, which had been established by Samuel Gompers in 1909, the New York City Label Council was dedicated to "a more systematic and thorough agitation and demand for union-made and particularly union label products, and for the patronage of union organizations issuing them." In 1916, the Council sold stock to establish a department store of union label products, which it then ran and stocked. After World War II, the increasing number of retail stores carrying union-made products greatly increased, prompting the Council to close its store in 1947.</p><p>The Label Council, and later its state counterpart, focused on lobbying, service and publicity, all in the interest of union-labeled goods produced by members of craft unions. Although separate central bodies existed in Manhattan and Brooklyn in 1911, the Central Union Label Council, headquartered in Brooklyn in its own building at 902-4 Broadway, bridged the boroughs. Charles Sinnigen, a member of the Electrotypers Local 100, served as the Council's Secretary. In 1935, the Union Label Trades and Services Department of the AFL chartered a Union Label Trades and Services Department for the state of New York. The organization moved to Bible House, where Charles Sinnigen directed both the city and the state organization as Secretary-Treasurer. The state organization called conventions annually and published the Union Label News.</p><p>After Sinnigen's death in 1949, Harry Avrutin, formerly an organizer for the Office and Professional Employees International Union, was elected Secretary-Treasurer of the Union Label and Services Trades Council of Greater New York. Placing greater emphasis on publicity tactics, Avrutin published annual buyers' guides to union-made products, mounted labor-management trade shows during "Union Label Week" (the first week of September), staged a "Miss Union Maid" beauty contest, sponsored a weekly Labor Press radio program, and engaged in other public relations efforts designed to promote union labor and products, and, increasingly, to encourage unionized business to remain in the metropolitan area. In 1959, the New York Council expanded its jurisdiction to Nassau and Suffolk Counties.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>In 1989, approximately 4 linear feet of non-print material including photoprints, buttons and badges, 200 glass lantern slides, bumper stickers, posters and scrapbooks of newsclippings have been separated from the printed records and added to two related collections: the Union Label and Service Trades Council of Greater New York and Long Island Photographs (PHOTOS 013)  and the Union Label and Service Trades Council of Greater New York and Long Island Lantern Slides (PHOTOS 024).</p><p>In May 2014, excess contents from Box 14 were placed into Box 26 due to preservation concerns. </p><p>Additional decisions regarding physical interventions for this collection prior to 2019 have not yet been recorded. In 2019, when preparing boxes 16-24 for offsite storage, a hardcopy of the 1989 finding aid was found with a container list for Boxes 1-15, which was added as Series I through XI. The folder numbering and container lists may not be up to date. Boxes 16-24 have been added as Series XII: Accretion. Materials were placed in new acid-free folders and boxes in preparation for offsite storage. The contents of boxes 25-27 have not yet been inventoried or surveyed at the time of the 2019 offsite prep, but the boxes may include items from 2000, 2003, and undated accessions. </p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The records of the Central Union Label Council and its related organizations  consist of correspondence, reports, flyers, news releases, programs, convention proceedings, speeches and publications, as well as non-print material such as photographs, buttons and posters. The collection documents both the behind­ the-scenes operation of this union public relations program, largely through the officers correspondence and the Executive Committee Minutes of the Central Union Label Council, as well as the implementation of that program, documented in its many publications and reports. Gaps are most evident in regards to the records of the ULSTD of NYS where early annual convention material is much less bulky than during the later years when H. Avrutin was Secretary-Treasurer.	Meeting minutes for the Executive Council of that organization are also spotty.</p><p>Correspondence between the ULSTD of the AFL in Washington, D.C. and the New York branch is a significant part of the Officers' Correspondence file.	C. Sinnigen stayed in close touch with I.M. Ornburn, Secretary-Treasurer of the national organization, and followed policy from that office. Materials from Series V on the ULSTD of the AFL show the extent to which the New York organizations followed the publicity programs of the Washington office. On the other hand, the New York office functioned as a national center for information about where to purchase union made goods and about which companies were organized. The Washington office used the Official Directory of AFL-CIO Union Products and Services (published by the ULSTD-NYS) as a national guide.</p><p>The work of Union Label as a lobbying organization is represented by letter writing campaigns to the New York City and New York state political leadership and by the inclusion of political leaders in Union Label publicity programs. Extensive involvement in labor-sponsored community programs by the leadership is also documented.</p><p>This collection is significant for its documentation at the city and state levels of larger national trends for American labor - the strengths and weaknesses of craft unionism in the 1930's and 1940's, the revitalization which came about from a merger with the industrial union movement, the expulsion of the Left from the labor movement in the 1950's and	the existence of a more hostile environment for unions in the 1970's and 80's.</p><p>Major subject areas likewise shift from disputes about CIO union labelled goods and goods without any union label to pressing economic issues like runaway shops and imports. By the mid 1970's, Charles Garrahan, President of the Greater New York and Long Island ULSTC stated that "the import issue has become the major cause within our jurisdiction." Similarly, the recent union label slogan "Buy union - the job you save may be your own" captures the shift which has occurred in the union label movement from a focus on craft pride to one of economic survival.</p><p>Series XII is comprised primarily of materials related to annual conventions including minutes, correspondence, promotional materials and press clippings. Also of note are files and press related to the Coors Brewing Company boycotts. Additionally files and photographs related to the naming and dedication of Union Square are included in the collection.</p>  </scopecontent>

Because the New York City office functioned as a national information center, correspondents were rank and file unionists from around the country, as well as politicians (such as Mayor La Guardia and Governor F. D. Roosevelt) responding to the lobbying efforts of the Union Label Council. Other prominent correspondents are George Meany and William Green. Arranged chronologically with incoming and outgoing letters on the same subject filed together by the date of the last letter, the correspondence also highlights the key role played by the Secretary-Treasurer (Charles Sinnigen from 1919-March, 1949 and Harry Avrutin from Dec. 1949-1977). Major subject areas documented by the letters, reports, flyers, programs, telegrams, speeches, invitations and minutes are: investigation of "phoney" union labels, objection to registration of new union labels with the NYS Dept. of Labor (usually non-AFL labels),  investigation of printed  material  without the Allied.</p><p>Printing Trades Council's label, involvement with the planning for the NY World's Fair (1937-1939), the War Bond and Stamp Committee (1943-1945), strike and boycott information, planning for publicity events and arranging speaking engagements at union meetings and conventions. The sub-series reflect some of the community work of the officers - Sinnigen:	Advisory Board on Vocational Education for the NYC Board of Education (a rich body of material on the development of vocational education), Non­ Partisan Committee of Queens County and the Board of Directors for the Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor. Sinnegen's reports and correspondence to the Union Label Trades Department, 1939- 1946, give full intelligence on CIO activities and AFL response in New York City. Avrutin:	Trade Union Campaign of Brooklyn Women's Hospital, Board for Camp Minimum Wage and the National Labor Council of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, Inc.

The news packets primarily focused on suggestions for Union Label Week activities each year. The ULSTD used news releases to advise unionists about which goods to buy and which were to be boycotted (subjects - United Furniture Workers, Kingsport Press, UFW grape and lettuce boycott and the Farah boycott).	In addition, the series includes the ULSTD's 1945 and 1946 editions of the Union Label Catalogue Directory and the 1964-1965 General Directory of Union-Made Products and Services.	A small amount of publicity material for the Union Industries Shows staged between 1949 and 1972 is included. Files on the ULSTD's conventions are primarily made up of reports to the conventions by H. Avrutin in his capacity as Secretary of the Special Committee on State and City Union Label Councils and Women's Auxiliaries and as Secretary-Treasurer of the NYS-ULSTD.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_64c39ec085cba6f60ebf72a06118872e" level="file"><did><unittitle>ULSTD news releases publications</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1945/1976" type="inclusive">1945-1976</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_f515281bf433499dc510e6d4822ae8fd" label="Mixed Materials [31142063515368]" type="Box">7</container><container id="aspace_7c6c77e3581c2b8db7c58b65df9a8d62" parent="aspace_f515281bf433499dc510e6d4822ae8fd" type="Folder">14-16</container></did></c><c id="aspace_86031e4f0760b67827f84317d854bdb1" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Do not buy"

Shea Stadium, the Union Label Pace at Roosevelt Raceway, Union Label Award of Merit Luncheons and promotionals such as the Little Miss Union Maid doll and the Union Industries Information Center set up for exhibits at the New York City office. Of special interest are the Miss Union Maid contest files which include application materials from women trade unionists (with a photograph and an essay about "what my union membership means to me") for five different contests during the period 1962-1972.
Files on the Labor-Management exhibition trade show held annually between 1957-1979 comprise a majority of this series. It includes extensive correspondence with both unions and businesses in an effort to secure exhibitors of union-made products. These files document a very cooperative approach to labor-management relations.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e7f5f316df13cbb9b7e6a083edf04eac"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is
