      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Miriam Frank's exploration into labor-gay alliances began in 1990 with the publication of a handbook titled Pride at Work: Organizing for Lesbian and Gay Rights in Unions, which she co-authored with her wife Desma Holcomb. This project entailed oral history interviews with New York City activists, which sparked Frank's initiative to delve further into the subject.
In 1994 Miriam was awarded New York University's Stephen Charney Vladeck Junior Faculty Fellowship. That year she began conducting interviews in New York City and would travel to six other cities to pursue her research. Her findings eventually culminated in 2014 with the publication of her book Out in the Union: A Labor History of Queer America.</p>
      <p>Frank received her B.A., M.A. and PhD from New York University where she served as an Adjunct Professor and Master Teacher of Humanities 1983-2014. She also taught labor history courses at union extension programs in Detroit and New York City, 1977-2009. She is the author of many other publications including The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter: the story of three million working women during World War II (1982).

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>At the time of accessioning, a preliminary file list and a collection-level finding aid was created to describe these materials. No physical processing or arrangement was done at this time.</p>
      <p>In 2013-2015 the collection was digitized by the New York University Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department. Through this process, access CDs were created for researcher use, and the original material was placed in archival housing. After the digitization process was finished, a complete finding aid was published in 2015. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The collection consists of 79 interviews conducted by Miriam Frank in 1994-2009. Possible alternate spellings of interviewee names and/or pseudonyms are noted in the Scope and Contents note of that interview. Summaries of content are also located in the Scope and Contents note for each tape. These summaries are based on Frank's research notes. </p>
      <p>The interviews are both biographical and topical covering such themes as family and class identity, the influence of the political left and/or the church, love, and death. Specific labor topics Frank sought to document were institutional policies and new bargaining issues with regard to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer workers; the history of gay participation in unions, both hidden and "out"; resistance to LGBTQ workers and activists in some sectors of the labor movement; labor education and AIDS education; the influence of community organizing; and union organizing and collective bargaining in queer community workplaces. </p>
      <p>Through these interviews, Frank sought to expose individual situations of struggle and to create a detailed history of LGBTQ activism in the labor movement. In the course of her research, Frank conducted and recorded over 100 interviews, 79 of which are located at the Tamiment Library. Most of these interviews are quoted and indexed in Frank's book <emph render="italic">Out in the Union: A Labor History of Queer America</emph>.</p>
