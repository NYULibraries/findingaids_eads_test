She was a member of the Communist Party of the United States' (CPUSA) pioneer movement, and during her youth she helped organize in laundries and participated in garment strikes. This collection consists of materials created and collected by Smith documenting her family, personal life, union organizing, involvement with the CPUSA, and advocacy for tenants rights in New York City in the late 20th century, with her involvement with the Park Terrace Tenants Association particularly prominent.

      <head>Custodial History</head>
      <p>At the request of Jane La Tour, two collections of materials concerning Morris Eli Taft, Jessie Taft Smith's father, were deaccessioned from the Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archives at Cornell University in June of 2015 and constituted the family papers that were included with the donation to the Tamiment Library. The collections had been identified at the Kheel Center as the Morris Eli Taft Papers (#5178m) and the Morris Eli Taft Memorabilia (#5178 MB).</p>
