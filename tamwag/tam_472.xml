In 2015, the URL redirected to https://law.shu.edu/policy-research/guantanamo-reports.cfm and was added to the collection. In November 2015, these websites were migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In November 2024, https://law.shu.edu/center-policy-research/guantanamo-reports.html was added. The accession number associated with this website is 2025.003.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Etablished in 2006, Seton Hall University School of Law's Center for Policy and Research is led by Professor Mark P. Denbeaux and focuses on the issues of "Interrogations &amp; Intelligence, National Security, and Forensics." Denbeaux's work for Guantánamo Bay detainees led him to lead the production of a series of reports on Guantánamo that have become the Center's most well-known initiative. Fellows with the Center for Policy and Research analyze government data to illuminate the interrogations and intelligence practices of the United States. The reports have been introduced into the Congressional record by the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and as part of a resolution by the European Parliament.</p>  </bioghist>
