The organization sought to promote and foster the study and practice of the language, literature, music, art, history, and cultures of Ireland, as well as the history of the Irish in America.

The New York Gaelic Society was part of the Council of Gaelic Societies, alongside a number of other groups focused on particular neighborhoods or topical areas.
