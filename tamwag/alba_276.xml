    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Rosa Margaret Harvan (1913-1988) was an author, photographer, dental technician, and volunteer medical assistant during the Spanish Civil War. Harvan was born in Lansford, Pennsylvania to Andrew and Anna Harvan, immigrants from Czechoslovakia. While completing her high school degree, she worked as a dental technician for a local dentist, Dr. Breslin. After graduating high school, she moved to New York City and continued to work as a dental technician. </p><p>Harvan joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and was sent to Spain on May 10, 1937 on the <emph render = "italic">SS Normandie</emph>. While in Spain, she served with the Republican Medical Service, Benicasim. During her time in Spain, she befriended novelist Ernest Hemingway and photojournalist Robert Capa. Harvan returned to the United States on December 8, 1938 on the <emph render = "italic">SS Ausonia</emph>. </p><p>Harvan was married several times, including a marriage to American filmmaker, Herbert Kline, whom she met in Spain. The two married in 1939 and relocated to Czechoslovakia. Here, they worked together to make the documentary, <emph render = "italic">Crisis</emph> (1939), which focused on the 1938 Munich Agreement. Harvan and Kline returned to the United States, settling in New York and then Los Angeles. They worked together on another documentary, <emph render = "italic">The Forgotten Village</emph> (1941), which was written by John Steinbeck and focused on growing tensions between the rise of modernization and waning traditional cultural values in a small Mexican village. After this film, the couple divorced.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Rosa Harvan Papers (dated 1939-2009, inclusive; 1937-1961, bulk) consists of a scrapbook documenting Harvan's activities during the Spanish Civil War; photographs documenting her visit to Mexico while filming <emph render = "italic">The Forgotten Village</emph>; photographs of Harvan, as well as unifentified people and locations; manuscript drafts for her novels <emph render = "italic">Lover and Stranger</emph>, <emph render = "italic">The Accomplished Days</emph>, and <emph render = "italic">Cailin</emph>; a scrapbook of photographs,  newspaper clippings, and reviews for the documentary film  <emph render = "italic">Crisis</emph>, which she worked on with her then-husband, Herbert Kline; and correspondence concerning the potential publication of Harvan's manuscript <emph render = "italic">Cailin</emph> and other shorter works. The collection also contains an interview between Thomas Dublin and Harvan's brother, George, which provides insight into Harvan's early years, her time with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, and her marriage to Herbert Kline. Harvan was married to Allen Chellas at some point and as a result of this marriage, she occasionally signed her work using Chellas as part of her last name.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>In January 2025, this collection was processed and described by an archivist. Materials were rehoused into archival boxes and acid-free folders. Original folder titles were retained when possible, but some folders were re-titled to better reflect their contents. Manuscripts housed in three-ring binders were removed from their binders and placed into archival folders. Loose photographs were placed into mylar sleeves. Three scrapbooks were sent to New York University's Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department for stabilization and rehousing. Materials were described on the collection-level and inventoried at the file-level.</p>  </processinfo>
