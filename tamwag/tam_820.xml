    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The American Jewish Left in the Digital Age collection documents the efforts, voices, and materials that have defined the American Jewish left in the twenty-first century. Focusing on the new publications, organizations, and activities initiated by the millennial generation of American Jews, this collection traces how these young Jews responded to cultural trends, political concerns, and technological transformations of the twenty-first century. The collection also documents how Jewish millennials have utilized activism to find Jewish social, cultural, and religious meaning and engagement. Subjects covered within the scope of this collection include the activities, writings, social media, and materials of publications and local and national activist movements have been run by millennials and have defined themselves as part of the wider Jewish left, consciously combining Jewishness with American leftist politics.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>Websites are selected by curators Sandra Fox and Shannon O'Neill through the use of Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. The accession numbers associated with these websites are 2023.039 and 2024.006.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>In March 2023, curators Sandra Fox and Shannon O'Neill selected websites related to the Jewish digital left. The collection was maintained by Nicole Greenhouse. Maintenance of the collection consisted of rescoping due to missing captured content, redirects and content drift, missing embedded materials (such as videos or attached Google documents and pdfs), and other materials created by selected entities that is related to the Jewish digital left. The finding aid was created in Spring 2023 and description was standardized across the collection. </p><p>Twitter feeds were both captured using Archive-It and Webrecorder.</p><p>Additional website was added in January 2024.</p>  </processinfo>

Founded 1946 by Jewish communists, its editors handed to the magazine to a new group of millennial editors in 2018, which have since redesigned it, grown its staff, and greatly expanded its reach.
