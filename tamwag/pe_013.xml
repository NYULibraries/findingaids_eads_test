    <abstract id="aspace_23640a47671196868eb0230b330180d9">The Printed Ephemera Collection on the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union is an artificial collection, collected and assembled by the Tamiment Library over the course of several decades. The ILGWU, founded in 1900, led the fight to organize workers in the garment trades, greatly improving the lives and the working conditions for hundreds of thousands of clothing workers in the United States. The collection is a rich source of history of the ILGWU, as told through their numerous and wonderfully illustrated story books and pamphlets. The collection also contains a range of printed ephemera such as fliers, brochures, newspaper clippings, reprinted articles, manuals and other publications. Material in the collection comes from various departments of the international and national bodies of the ILGWU. Workers education was a primary concern to the ILGWU, and thus a sizable portion of the collection comes from their Education Department. Additionally, this collection provides material from locals, regions, and Joint Boards from around the country, but most notably from New York City, arguably the center of activity for the ILGWU, and includes material from New York City locals 1, 10, 22, and 91 among others. The material ranges in date from the founding of the ILGWU in 1900 through to the present.</abstract>

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) was founded in New York City in 1900 in an effort to consolidate the power of the various garment trades into one collective force. The history of garment workers in general and of the nascent organizing efforts of the ILGWU in the early 20th century is plagued with tragedy, most well-known being the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911 that claimed the lives of 146 workers who were locked into the factory and could not escape when a fire broke out. However, despite difficult conditions the ILGWU was hugely successful through work stoppages and strike campaigns in organizing large masses of garment workers in New York and around the country, establishing better working conditions and shorter working hours. In 1909, shirtwaist workers revolted in what was known as the "Uprising of 20,000" that eventually won the 52-hour work week. Over the next decade, strikes all over the country continued to win better conditions for garment workers. In 1913, the Union Health Center was established in New York City and provided decent and urgently needed health care for union members. Due to internal strife involving communist and anti-communist leadership, hardening economic conditions as well as anti-union efforts, the ILGWU and its membership suffered through the 1920s. Roosevelt's presidency and better labor laws brought a resurgence to organizing. David Dubinsky became president of the union in 1932 and served until 1966. Under Dubinsky's leadership, the union helped establish the Congress of Industrial Organizations, but eventually disaffiliated with them and went back to the American Federation of Labor in 1940. The ILGWU was a trailblazer in terms of providing education for workers, The Union's Education Department was vibrant, churning out pamphlets and publication on union history, membership and leadership. The ILGWU established social centers, offering numerous educational, community and athletic activities for its membership. Communism and corruption continued to be major sources of internal struggle for the ILGWU through the 1950s.</p><p>In July 1995 the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) at a joint convention, forming UNITE (Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees). Then in 2004, UNITE and the Hotel Employees &amp; Restaurant Employees International Union (HERE) merged to form Unite Here. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Printed Ephemera Collection on the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union provides a rich source of information on the ILGWU's organizing activities, education campaigns and internal struggles. Comprised of constitutions and reports, as well as printed ephemera such as fliers, brochures, newspaper clippings, pamphlets and other publications, the collection ranges in date from 1903-2009. </p><p>Providing workers with access to education was a key effort of the ILGWU. Consequently, their Education Department was prolific in churning out manuals, guides, and histories on the Union. Cultural activities were also an important aspect of building the Union, and the ILGWU established social centers, providing members with classes and lectures as well athletic and social events. Premiering in Hollywood in 1950, the ILGWU presented a movie about their history, "With these Hands," and the collection contains fliers, promotional material, and pamphlets about the film. </p><p>Bernard Seaman, a talented illustrator, drew the artwork for a considerable number of pamphlets and publications in the collection. His work is striking and lends the printed material of the ILGWU its unique aesthetic. </p><p>The ILGWU was founded in New York City, though its membership grew and spread throughout the country. The material in this collection comes largely from the national and international bodies, but also the locals, regionals, and Joint Boards in and around New York City. Most notably are the Amalgamated Ladies' Garment Cutters' Union (Local 10), the Dressmakers Union (Local 22), the Northeast Department and the Joint Board of Dress and Waistmakers' Union of Greater New York.  </p>  </scopecontent>
