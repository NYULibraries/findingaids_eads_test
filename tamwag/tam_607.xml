    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Marvin Leiner is the author of several books on sexual politics, education, and childcare in Cuba. Much of his research comes from interviews he conducted and diaries he kept while living in Cuba for the 1968-1969 school year and subsequent trips he made in the 1970s and 1980s. Leiner taught for many years in the Bedford Stuyvesant and Bushwick sections of Brooklyn. He has a Ph.D. in Elementary Education from New York University, and he has lectured in Latin American Studies at Yale and was a Fellow of Yale's Trumbull College. </p><p>Leiner's best known book, <emph render="italic">Sexual Politics in Cuba: Machismo, Homosexuality, and AIDS</emph>, analyzes the Cuban practice of quarantining individuals with HIV in the context of the Cuban Revolution. The book also examines the social and educational effects of the Cuban government's intolerance of homosexuality and the efforts by Cuban educators to introduce sex education in schools. Leiner's research interests also include other education reforms in the wake of the Cuban Revolution, particularly the Escuela al Campo (School to the Countryside) program, which incorporated literacy, sports, and cultural programs into agricultural work in the countryside. His other works on the topic of education include <emph render="italic">Children Are the Revolution: Daycare in Cuba</emph> and <emph render="italic">Children of the Cities: Education of the Powerless</emph>, which he edited. Leiner is a Professor Emeritus of Education at Queens College, City University of New York.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The collection was intellectually arranged into series based on the original order of the materials as maintained by Marvin Leiner. Minimal physical rehousing involved providing archival folders for loose materials found in the boxes, and to replace overstuffed or damaged folders. Original folder titles were retained and copied onto the new archival folders. Some materials were shifted between boxes to correct over- or understuffing, but in all cases the original order of the materials was maintained. Documents with sensitive personal information were removed and deaccessioned.</p>  </processinfo>
