    <abstract id="aspace_4e68b48f3f214dbac5b84b30bd82cecf">The United Literary Workers (ULW), originally created as the Literacy Workers Organization, was an organization of teachers, counselors, administrators, and education support staff in the field of adult education. From 1990-1998, the group worked to promote the material interests of their membership, increase funding for and encourage redirection of government funding priorities toward adult education, and bring about greater recognition of adult education as a profession. In the 1990s, the adult literacy community was largely composed of literacy providing agencies such as the Board of Education and City University of New York (CUNY), as well as community-based organizations and public libraries. ULW functioned as an independent voice for adult literacy workers at a time when there was not an organized body to advocate for literacy workers, and literacy workers were often at the margins of education labor movements. They frequently struggled to get by as they were mostly compensated with low and hourly wages. ULW formed to create a space and community for solidarity and advocacy among literacy workers. With an attunement to questions of social justice, ULW advocated strongly for the visibility and leadership of literacy students and pushed against the trend of adult literacy's growing focus on workforce development. The United Literacy Workers Records (dated 1990-1998) documents the work and activism of ULW. It includes ULW newsletters, by-laws, legal documents for ULW's filing as a non-profit, documentation of annual meetings and conferences for ULW members, and agendas and meeting notes. The collection additionally includes photographs from demonstrations in which ULW members participated. The materials reflect the context and the work of educators in the field of adult literacy, in particular in the 1990s when ULW functioned at its peak.</abstract>
