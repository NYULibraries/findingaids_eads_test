    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The "Saga: Afro-American Soldiers in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade" Slide Show (1951, 1979), contains the original slides, as well as drafts of scripts and storyboards, of a slide show that was presented at Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade's (VALB) 43rd Anniversary dinner, held in San Francisco in 1980. It also includes a photocopy of a 1951 issue of <emph render="italic">Volunteer for Liberty</emph>.</p><p>The draft scripts and storyboards include handwritten edits, and the storyboard aligns each slide with a script section. Each slide is numbered, and the number is referenced on the storyboard.  The slideshow begins by showing a history of Black military service, including Crispus Attuck's role in the American Revolution and Black soldiers fighting for the Union during the American Civil War. It goes on to outline the anti-Black racism in the U.S. and explain how the 1935 Italian invasion of Ethiopia under Benito Mussolini mobilized Black Americans to anti-fascist causes. </p><p>Reasearchers are advised that the slides include photographs that illustrate racism, including pictures of lynched men on slides 1-14 and 1-49.</p><p>The bulk of the slide show identifies and tells the stories of individual Black volunteers, offering biographical information such as where they lived and their occupations, details about their service in the Brigade, and information about their lives after they returned to the U.S. The end of the slideshow explores the experiences of these Black soldiers upon their return to the still-segregated U.S. using quotations from veterans. The slideshow ends with a list of 85 Black veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. </p><p>This collection also includes a photocopy of the March 7, 1951 issue of <emph render="italic">Volunteer for Liberty</emph>, which recounts what the New York VALB Post did that year to recognize "Negro History Week," including holding a dance to raise funds for the Black monthly publication <emph render="italic">Freedom</emph> and showing a slide show highlighting the contributions of Black Brigade members.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) was created by and for Americans who volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. This Brigade was a part of the International Brigades and was racially integrated. The soldiers organized VALB upon their return from Spain, and in 1939, the organization adopted a constitution and a formal structure. VALB headquarters were in New York City, with posts in other cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago. VALB also created a newsletter, the <emph render="italic">Volunteer for Liberty</emph> (later, <emph render="italic">The Volunteer</emph>). In addition to assisting wounded veterans and political advocacy, VALB also planned educational and social events for members, such as history lectures and anniversary dinners.</p><p>The "Saga: Afro-American Soldiers in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade" Slide Show was created by VALB in 1979 and presented at the organization's 43rd Anniversary Dinner in 1980. </p><p>In the late 1970s, VALB members collected materials about Brigade veterans and in 1978, VALB formally established the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives as a non-profit entity. </p>  </bioghist>
