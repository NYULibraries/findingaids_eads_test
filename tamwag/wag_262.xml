    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>From the late 1940s until his death in 1975, Sam Reiss was among the most prominent and prolific photographers of the labor movement in New York City. During the three decades that Reiss earned a living with his camera, he documented a changing work force in a changing city, building a reputation as "Labor's Photographer." Week by week, throughout his career, Reiss made photographs that document New York's labor movement during its most active, influential, and progressive years. .</p><p>Born in New York City in 1910, Reiss was the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants. He grew up in the city, where his father worked as a tailor. Like many children of New Yorkers who worked in the garment industry, Reiss hoped to escape having to make a living in an economic sector beleaguered by difficult working conditions and low pay. After graduating from Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School in 1929, Reiss enrolled at New York University as a pre-dental major, intending to join the ranks of professionals by becoming a dentist. At the University he attended only night classes to allow him to work a garment-industry job during the day. By January of 1933, after four years, Reiss had managed to accrue two years of college credits. It was then that his father suffered a stroke that left him disabled; Reiss dropped out of school to help support his family and found full-time employment as a shipping clerk at a clothing factory in the men's garment district.</p><p>In 1936, Reiss enrolled in evening photography classes at the Brooklyn Museum's Art School, where he remembered that his first instructor was Tom O'Scheckel, a pictorialist photographer who had served as president of the Pictorial Photographers of America. Using a simple wooden box camera, Reiss began photographing during his lunch hour; he photographed co-workers as well as other laborers on the streets of New York City. In 1938 he wed Helen Handwerger; two daughters, Jessie and Harriet, were born to them.</p><p>During World War II Reiss found work as a machinist, but when his shop struck in 1946, he used the enforced hiatus to take the opportunity to attempt to earn his living with photography. He started by shooting baby pictures, weddings, and bar mitzvah celebrations, but did not meet with success until he started to specialize as a press photographer for labor union publications. He received his first labor news assignment in 1947, when he was hired to shoot some photographs for the <emph render="italic">RWDSU Record</emph>, the newspaper of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Workers Union. Throughout his nearly thirty-year career, the RWDSU, as well as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, the Transport Workers Union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the International Ladies Garment Workers Union remained among Reiss's major clients, employing him regularly to document the activities of their organizations, although he also shot for dozens of other labor unions and locals.</p><p>In addition to his labor union and other organizational clients, Reiss continued to do private commercial photography. However, it is worth noting that the subjects of many of these photographs were labor figures and their families; Reiss was frequently a union official's choice of photographer for photographing personal family events such as weddings and birthdays, or children's portraits.</p><p>Reiss continued to work until only a few months before his death from cancer in December 1975. That same year, a retrospective exhibit of his work was mounted by his daughter, Jessie, and displayed at the gallery of AFSCME, District Council 37.</p><p>Sources:</p><p><list><item>Bildersee, Barnett.

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>Collection encompasses miscellaneous personal/biographical items including a college transcript, labor union-related press badges, union membership/dues cards, job notebooks, certificates, correspondence, and five daily diaries-cum-appointment-books for the years 1970 through 1973, and 1975. The latter appear to record almost exclusively photography jobs rather than any private or personal information. (Although Reiss died in December of 1975, after a lingering illness, the last diary entry is in late September of 1975.) The Collection also includes a book published by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, <emph render="italic">Health Security By Union Action: A Report on the Sidney Hillman Health Center</emph>, that was apparently illustrated exclusively with Reiss' photographs, plus issues of 21 different labor union and liberal political organizations' newspaper titles as well as 34 additional publications, from between 1953-1971, which include Reiss' photographs. A partial list gives a good indication of the breadth of Reiss' documentation of the labor movement in the New York metropolitan area, as well as his long list of clients: <emph render="italic">The 65er</emph>(Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union District 65), <emph render="italic">The Advance</emph>(Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America), <emph render="italic">Allegro</emph>(Associated Musicians of Greater New York), <emph render="italic">AFL-CIO News</emph>(Washington, D.
