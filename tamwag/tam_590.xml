          <p>This series contains publications and reports documenting the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, particularly Indonesian political prisoners and human rights violations committed against the East Timorese by the Indonesian military. These publications and reports were generated by human rights organizations, public interest and advocacy groups, international organizations, political agencies, and independent writers. Some of the organizations represented are: TAPOL (UK, US and Canada), Campaign for an Independent East Timor, East Timor Defense Committee, the East Timor News Agency, Pacific Studies Center, East Timor Research Project, Clergy and Laity Concerned, Amnesty International, and the United Nations. Much of the material produced by the smaller independent advocacy and information centers were produced with donated labor.</p>
          <p>Most of the publications specifically relate information and news updates on Indonesia's repressive occupation of East Timor, the state of political prisoners, the Fretilin struggle against the Indonesian military, and U.S., Australia, and other western nations' international policies on Indonesia and East Timor. There is a small number of materials related to Sukarno and Suharto, the first and second presidents of Indonesia respectively.
TAPOL publications include newsletters and bulletins of TAPOL's UK, US and Canadian divisions. TAPOL often created background histories and chronologies of the Indonesian occupation, as well as collections of media coverage.</p>
          <p>Other publications pertain to anti-colonial and anti-imperial resistance, including activist and advocacy campaigns against Indonesian oppression, protests and global solidarity actions and mobilization efforts, and liberation movements outside of Indonesia. A smaller number of publications pertain generally to Indonesia at large, its political and economic development with a small grouping related to the communist party PKI.
 
There are a small number of publications pertaining to Western Sahara and West Papua. The Western Sahara materials particularly relate to the on-going Moroccan occupation and its resistance.  Some of this material pertains specifically to or was created by the Polisario Front (Frente Polisario) a Western Saharan armed resistance movement against Moroccan occupation. Much of the material related to the Western Sahara are French language. The material on West Papua (Western New Guinea) pertain to the Indonesian occupation of that region and repression, particularly the violence against indigenous populations, and its resistance.</p>
          <p>These series also contain a substantial collection of reports of hearings to the U.S. House Committee on International Relations and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, circa 1970's. These reports relate to the human rights violations in East Timor and other Asian and Pacific Island nations, and U.S. aid relief to East Timor. There are also reports on U.S. policy in neighboring countries or other nations.
This series contains mostly English language material, with some material written in Indonesian, Dutch, French, Portuguese and other languages.</p>

          <p>This small series contains correspondence between Franke and advocates from human rights organizations, U.S. government, public interest and activist groups, policy organizations, and academics. Some of the correspondence is not directed to Franke, but amongst other parties and organizations. Several of the organizations and people represented are Amnesty International, Ford Foundation, and Committee to Protect Journalists. Much of Franke's correspondence relates to information and updates on the East Timor situation, advocacy campaigns, TAPOL funding, and requests for TAPOL and related publications. This series consists substantially of correspondence pertaining to human rights activist and TAPOL UK cofounder Carmel Budiardjo - her imprisonment, campaigns for her release, and her 1976 speaking tour in the U.S.
 
This series also contains a number of letters addressed to the U.S. Congress, the Department of State and other governmental agencies related to the situation in East Timor, Indonesian political prisoners, and U.S. aid and involvement. Some of the aforementioned letters are form letters from advocacy groups. There are also several letters to the editor of major news media outlets concerned with their coverage of the occupation of East Timor.</p>

          <p>This small series contains Richard Franke's writings on East Timor and Indonesia. It includes some of Franke's articles and manuscripts, as well as his reviews of other works on the subject. The manuscripts include a few early drafts of Franke's pamphlet entitled "East Timor: The Hidden War," issued by the East Timor Defense Committee in 1976. It details a brief history of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, the U.S military involvement in the conflict, Fretilin and the East Timorese' struggle for independence, and calls to action. The early drafts of this work contain inscription, including layout notes, and original photographs. There are also two copies of the final published pamphlet. Some of Franke's writings are accompanied with research material. This series also contains Franke's conference material from the Permanent People's Tribunal Session on East Timor which was held in Lisbon, Portugal on June 19-21, 1981. An oversized poster from this conference material was separated and placed in Series VII.</p>
