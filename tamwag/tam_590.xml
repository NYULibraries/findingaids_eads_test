The articles and clippings reflect the news coverage of the Indonesian occupation and other writings on the history, politics, and culture of Indonesia, East Timor, and other Asian and Pacific Island nations. The publications and reports, as well as the subject files, and correspondence, details the advocacy work of organizations such as TAPOL USA and UK, East Timor Defense Committee, and Amnesty International. Many of the organizations are US, UK, and Australia based. Much of the correspondence reflects Franke's work with TAPOL and other activist or advocacy groups. The collection also contains a substantial number UN and US. Congressional records, predominantly statements and testimonies. A small number of materials reflect liberation struggles of Western Sahara, Asian and Pacific Island nations and peoples. There is a small number of photographic and graphic materials, and memorabilia related to the work and causes of TAPOL and other political and human rights groups.</p>  </scopecontent>

These publications and reports were generated by human rights organizations, public interest and advocacy groups, international organizations, political agencies, and independent writers. Some of the organizations represented are: TAPOL (UK, US and Canada), Campaign for an Independent East Timor, East Timor Defense Committee, the East Timor News Agency, Pacific Studies Center, East Timor Research Project, Clergy and Laity Concerned, Amnesty International, and the United Nations. Much of the material produced by the smaller independent advocacy and information centers were produced with donated labor.</p><p>Most of the publications specifically relate information and news updates on Indonesia's repressive occupation of East Timor, the state of political prisoners, the Fretilin struggle against the Indonesian military, and U.S., Australia, and other western nations' international policies on Indonesia and East Timor. There is a small number of materials related to Sukarno and Suharto, the first and second presidents of Indonesia respectively.
TAPOL publications include newsletters and bulletins of TAPOL's UK, US and Canadian divisions. TAPOL often created background histories and chronologies of the Indonesian occupation, as well as collections of media coverage.</p><p>Other publications pertain to anti-colonial and anti-imperial resistance, including activist and advocacy campaigns against Indonesian oppression, protests and global solidarity actions and mobilization efforts, and liberation movements outside of Indonesia. A smaller number of publications pertain generally to Indonesia at large, its political and economic development with a small grouping related to the communist party PKI.
 
There are a small number of publications pertaining to Western Sahara and West Papua. The Western Sahara materials particularly relate to the on-going Moroccan occupation and its resistance.  Some of this material pertains specifically to or was created by the Polisario Front (Frente Polisario) a Western Saharan armed resistance movement against Moroccan occupation. Much of the material related to the Western Sahara are French language. The material on West Papua (Western New Guinea) pertain to the Indonesian occupation of that region and repression, particularly the violence against indigenous populations, and its resistance.</p><p>These series also contain a substantial collection of reports of hearings to the U.S. House Committee on International Relations and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, circa 1970's. These reports relate to the human rights violations in East Timor and other Asian and Pacific Island nations, and U.S. aid relief to East Timor. There are also reports on U.S. policy in neighboring countries or other nations.
This series contains mostly English language material, with some material written in Indonesian, Dutch, French, Portuguese and other languages.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_b654d099fbc101b7027ab3b94ae5664f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Publications and Reports</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/861153</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1965/1991" type="inclusive">1965-1991</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_c1220d875bc7b015ad0f66c4cf48b63f" label="Mixed Materials [31142062851897]" type="Box">16</container><container id="aspace_c0a7a52079d1094c380d662b88088f15" parent="aspace_c1220d875bc7b015ad0f66c4cf48b63f" type="Folder">1-6</container><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_27454e9f02f70a517d7358a33dfcb646" label="Mixed Materials [31142062851905]" type="Box">17</container><container id="aspace_a6f6352edd863f68ed5d9f2d1b0aa73a" parent="aspace_27454e9f02f70a517d7358a33dfcb646" type="Folder">1-10</container><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_9b6f37cbdbeec26682cc6e64f65b4b2f" label="Mixed Materials [31142062851913]" type="Box">18</container><container id="aspace_bbc4dd7e9fcd0b9ff1f089b90e0ca9bd" parent="aspace_9b6f37cbdbeec26682cc6e64f65b4b2f" type="Folder">1-8</container><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_47dd824601a51680ffaf018d9e26dcfd" label="Mixed Materials [31142062851921]" type="Box">19</container><container id="aspace_4866d86740c1cdf3599e339139cac370" parent="aspace_47dd824601a51680ffaf018d9e26dcfd" type="Folder">1-7</container><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_a914864397c9810299217ef58fb871f8" label="Mixed Materials [31142062851939]" type="Box">20</container><container id="aspace_b0b9e7eee2b1c964b4a0900ffb45918f" parent="aspace_a914864397c9810299217ef58fb871f8" type="Folder">1-8</container><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_c5e96af2b35b0aced8a02a392426ff7a" label="Mixed Materials [31142062851947]" type="Box">21</container><container id="aspace_c5bbe6192af781920231b3a3b6c6268d" parent="aspace_c5e96af2b35b0aced8a02a392426ff7a" type="Folder">1-7</container><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_0c049bb65e09604ec9316ed439fffa3b" label="Mixed Materials [31142062851954]" type="Box">22</container><container id="aspace_090cf831ce0d195b932f7a54ffffb613" parent="aspace_0c049bb65e09604ec9316ed439fffa3b" type="Folder">1-7</container><container altrender="Flat OS Box - 16" id="aspace_22352e8d506c659dcc1b767fed11c3ea" label="Mixed Materials [31142062851962]" type="Box">23</container><container id="aspace_90efa42b5a9139fddcfe8c368660d82e" parent="aspace_22352e8d506c659dcc1b767fed11c3ea" type="Folder">1-5</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_f8aa330ba9bf8985dbac34420bba9904" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series II.
