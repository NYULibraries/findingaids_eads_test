    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Thomas Gately (1828-1905), a native of Dublin, Ireland, was one of 11 children. As a child he lived with an uncle who was a draper, then in his teens shipped as a cabin boy on a sailing vessel. He emigrated to New York City around 1847. From 1850 to 1854 he worked at the Coolidge and Young distillery as the foreman of the rectifying floor, the stage at which a beverage's alcohol proof is adjusted by adding water or other liquids. He met Catherine Douglas (1835-1858), whose father owned a prosperous milk business. They were married in St. Mary's Church on Grand Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan on April 25, 1952 and eventually had three children: Margaret (1853-1854), Philip (1854-1948), and Joseph T. (1856-1905). On November 11, 1854 Gately became an American citizen.</p><p>In 1856 Gately was working as a distiller, compounder, and rectifier of spiritous liquors at the John Tracy and Co. plant in Albany, New York. During the Civil War he enlisted as a private in Company A of the 69th Regiment and fought at the Battle of Bull Run. He was honorably discharged on August 3, 1861. About seven years after the death of his first wife, Thomas Gately married Elizabeth Curran (1840-1879) in St. Joseph's Church in Albany on June 18, 1865. They had six children: Francis (1866-1932), Marcella (1868-1895), James (1870-1897), Thomas (1873-1918), Alphonsus (1875-1949), and Mary Elizabeth (1879).</p><p>Joseph T. Gately became a builder and contractor in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, specializing in masonry. On June 21, 1881 he married Catherine C. McQuillan (1856-1921) at St. Vincent de Paul's Church in Williamsburg. They had ten children: Irene "Rene" (1882-1974), Philip (1883-1906), Charles S. "Charlie," later Father Charles (1885-1917), Catherine "Kate" (1887-1954), Joseph "Joe" V. (1889-1961), Helen "Nell," later Sister Miriam Fidelis, 1891-1974), Thomas A. "Tom," later Father Thomas (1896-1996), Adrian C. (1898-1970), Rosemary C. (1900-1965), and Francis "Frank."</p><p>Adrian C. Gately spent his career in the Treasury Department of Consolidated Edison Company in New York City, retiring in 1964. His brother, Francis P. Gately also worked for the company. Adrian Gately married M. Loretta McDermott, a teacher, in 1939 and had two sons: Adrian C. and Dermot. Dermot became a professor of economics at NYU and has three children.</p><p>
