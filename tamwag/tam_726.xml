      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Robert Bernstein (born 1923) is an American publisher and human rights advocate.  He worked at Simon &amp; Schuster from 1946 to 1956 and at Random House from 1956 to 1991, serving as the president of Random House between 1966 and 1991.  He worked closely with Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss) on the Beginner Books division of Random House between 1959 and 1991.</p>
      <p>After traveling to the Soviet Union a number of times between 1970 and 1973, and meeting with dissident authors Andrei Sakharov and Elena Bonner, he established the Fund for Free Expression in 1973 in order to promote the works of Sakharov, Bonner, and other dissident authors.  He founded 
Helsinki Watch in 1978, which focused on the human rights section of the Helsinki Accords.  Helsinki Watch led to other watch groups, which were all brought together under Human Rights Watch in 1988.  Bernstein served as the chair between 1978 and 1998, and has served as Founding Chair Emeritus since 1998.  He has been involved with several human rights organizations, including Advancing Human Rights and Human Rights in China.  He served on the boards of several charitable organizations, including Legal Services for Children (later Partnership for Children's Rights), the Sigrid Rausing Trust, and Bard College's Institute for International Liberal Education and the Bard Prison Initiative.  In 2016 he published his autobiography, <emph render="italic">Speaking Freely: My Life in Publishing and Human Rights</emph>.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>Series were created from topical categories in which the collection was received.  Material for each series was brought together physically, and within each series material was organized in alphabetical order by organization or personal name, topic, or format.  Material housed in binders was removed and rehoused in folders.  Paper materials were rehoused in archival folders and boxes and optical media was housed in archival cases.</p>
      <p>Two CD-Rs were forensically imaged and mounted to local storage. Directories were created for one collection of graphics files and one word processing document, and the files were moved to the correct folder.  One Firewire hard drive could not be accessed.</p>
      <p>New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Robert Bernstein Papers document Bernstein's work in human rights and publishing; his autobiography, <emph render="italic">Speaking Freely: My Life in Publishing and Human Rights</emph> (2016); and other charitable organizations with which he was associated. The collection dates between 1925 and 2016, with the bulk of the material dating between 1995 and 2009.  Materials include correspondence, meeting agendas and minutes, clippings, speeches, pamphlets, article and book drafts, photographs, a digital video recording, oral history interviews, podcast episodes, and scrapbooks. Bernstein's work at Random House is documented through correspondence, contracts, interoffice memoranda, and oral history interviews with Bernstein.  This material includes correspondence, contracts, and memoranda with and about Theodor Seuss Geisel's work for Random House as the head of Beginner Books.  Bernstein's work with Human Rights Watch (HRW) is documented through correspondence, clippings, meeting agendas and minutes.  Topics in these materials include human rights issues in Israel, Palestine, and China, with the bulk of the correspondence pertaining to HRW's and Bernstein's responses to events in the Middle East in particular.  The collection contains material documenting Bernstein's relationship with other human rights and charitable organizations, including the Sigrid Rausing Trust, the Bard Prison Initiative, Legal Services for Children, Human Rights in China, and his relationships with Chinese dissidents Xu Wenli and Wei Jinsheng.  His relationships with these organizations and people are documented through correspondence, meeting agenda, and print and born-digital photographs.  Other material documenting the work of these people and organizations includes podcast episodes and a digital video recording.  The collection also contains notes and background material for <emph render="italic">Speaking Freely</emph> and drafts of op-eds by Bernstein.  </p>
      <p>The collection contains overlap across the four series, with material pertaining to Bernstein's work with Random House, HRW, and other human rights organizations existing in Series IV.  The materials filed under Series IV are a mix of material both unique and duplicative of that which exists in Series I through III.</p>

          <p>This series documents Bernstein's human rights work outside of Human Rights Watch and his relationships with other charitable organizations.  Material in this series dates between 1980 and 2014, with the bulk dating between 1993 and 2008.  Bernstein's work with Human Rights in China (HRIC), the Sigrid Rausing Trust, Bard College's Institute for International Liberal Education and Bard Prison Initiative, and Legal Services for Children (later Partnership for Children's Rights), is documented by correspondence, meeting agenda and minutes, publications, clippings, podcast episodes, and a digital video recording.  Included in this series is material related to Bernstein's work and personal relationships with Chinese dissidents Xu Wenli and Wei Jingsheng and his efforts to support their work in the United States.  Filed under their names, drafts and published versions of print and born-digital writings by Xu and Wei may be found as well as digital photographs of Bernstein and Xu.  Other material includes podcast episodes recorded by HRIC featuring interviews with participants of the 1989 Democracy Movement, a digital video recording produced by the Bard Prison Initiative about their program, subject files compiled by Bernstein on topics of interest to him, and speeches and op-eds written by Bernstein on human rights issues in general and in the Middle East in particular.</p>
