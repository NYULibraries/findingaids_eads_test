    <abstract id="aspace_47a644a6ee9dfff894a046a781356f49">Carl Frederick Geiser was born in Orrville, Ohio on December 10, 1910. He fought with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War as a member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and was taken prisoner and held in a fascist prisoner of war camp for a year before being released in April 1939.  After a career as an aeronautical engineer, he retired in 1971 and began to research and write a history of American volunteers captured during the Spanish Civil War.  His book, <emph render="italic">Prisoners of the Good Fight: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939</emph>, was published in 1986. The Carl Geiser Audio Recordings on Spanish Civil War Prisoners of War consist of 35 audiocassettes, most of them interviews with former prisoners conducted as part of the research for Geiser's book.  Also included are recordings of Geiser discussing trips to Cuba and Spain.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Carl Frederick Geiser was born in Orrville, Ohio on December 10, 1910. He was the oldest of six children; his father, a farmer, died in the influenza epidemic at the end of World War I, and his mother a year later of tuberculosis. His maternal grandparents, Swiss immigrants who spoke little English, raised Geiser and his siblings. The young Geiser received his primary education in a one-room schoolhouse while helping to tend the family's sixteen-acre farm. Upon his graduation from Orrville High School in 1928, he enrolled in the YMCA School of Technology (later Fenn College) in Cleveland, where he majored in electrical engineering.</p><p>In 1932, following the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, Geiser was part of the first National Student Federation mission to travel to the newly recognized country. Impressed by the Soviet system and the tenets of socialist ideology, Geiser joined the Young Communist League on his return to Ohio. He was active in the American Student Union in Cleveland and served as a delegate to the First Student Congress Against War and Fascism held in Chicago. It was there that Geiser met his future wife Sylvia, a teacher and organizer who shared his political fervor. The couple moved to New York where they were absorbed into a dynamic culture of political activism and organizing. Geiser wrote press releases and edited International Labor Defense bulletins, organized for the League against War and Fascism, and in 1936 was elected to the National Committee of the Young Communist League.</p><p>On April 13, 1937 Geiser boarded the S.S. Georgic to join the International Brigades massing in defense of the Spanish Republic. He served as an ammunition carrier at the Battle of Brunete, saw action at Quinto, and advanced to the rank of Lieutenant and then Political Commissar. Wounded at the conflict at Fuentes de Ebro, Geiser was hospitalized for three months. Returned to the front as Commissar of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion in January 1938, he was captured by fascist forces on April 1, 1938. For the next year, he was interned at San Pedro de Cardeña, along with over 650 International Brigades prisoners. Through the efforts of the Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and the U.S. State Department, Geiser and a group of 71 Americans were released in April 1939.</p><p>Geiser returned to New York and secured an engineering position with Liquidometer, a manufacturer of aeronautic equipment. By the early 1970s, Geiser turned his attention once more to Spain. Upon retirement at age 71, Geiser began to write a comprehensive history of American volunteers captured during the Spanish Civil War. With the assistance of fellow prisoner Robert Steck, Geiser amassed biographical information on the 120 Americans incarcerated in Spanish prisons. He also corresponded with over 150 veterans worldwide to solicit their reminiscences, and traveled to archives in the United States and Europe to conduct research. Five years of research and writing culminated in the  publication of <emph render="italic">Prisoners of the Good Fight</emph> (Lawrence Hill and Co., 1986).</p>  </bioghist>
