    <abstract id="aspace_516dc0aa09ea816b56832cfec2fcc024" label="Abstract">The Jewish Labor Committee was founded in 1934 for the purpose of organizing opposition to fascism and providing assistance to its victims. It maintained close contact with European resistance movements, and was able to effect the rescue of several thousand labor and socialist activists, their families and other refugees. After World War II, the Committee continued its program of relief to Holocaust victims and reconstruction of Jewish culture by financing Yiddish libraries, schools, and cultural centers throughout Europe and Israel, in addition to campaigning for trade union rights and against religious discrimination. The bulk of the material relates to the years immediately following World War II through the 1950s, and includes many photographs relating to the Committee's relief programs for Holocaust victims, especially children. Of special interest are images of the children's performances: singing, dancing, theater. Also depicted are supporters, including: David Dubinsky, Leon Blum, and Jacob Pat. In addition, there are images of Committee-supported Yiddish libraries, schools, and cultural centers, as well as, several hundred portrait photographs of individual children from the Committee's Child Adoption program.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Jewish Labor Committee, an umbrella group of Jewish trade unions and fraternal organizations, was founded in 1934 for the purpose of organizing opposition to fascism and providing assistance to its victims. It maintained close contact with European resistance movements and was able to effect the rescue of several hundred labor and socialist activists and their families, as well as other refugees. After World War II, the Committee continued its program of relief to Holocaust victims, providing regular shipments of food, clothing, and medical supplies. It cooperated with other Jewish agencies in helping reunite families, and organized a "Child Adoption" program through which American trade unionists supported thousands of destitute children. The Committee contributed to the reconstruction of Jewish culture after 1945 by financing Yiddish libraries, schools, and cultural centers throughout Europe and Israel. In addition, the Committee has campaigned for trade union rights in the United States and abroad, and against anti-Semitism and other forms of racial and religious discrimination.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The bulk of this material is concentrated in the years immediately following World War II and in the 1950s, and includes many photographs relating to the Committee's relief programs for Holocaust victims, especially children. Most of these photographs were shot in Europe (including Austria, Belgium, England, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland, but with the largest number shot in France) and in Israel. They are particularly strong in images of children's homes supported by the Committee--often in concert with the Workmen's Circle or United States labor unions. These include images of the exteriors of the homes themselves (several are quite impressive, resembling small chateaux), and of various activities within them: children at meals, in class, playing, getting dressed, being examined by medical personnel, etc. Of special interest are images of the children's performances: singing, dancing, theater. Also depicted are visitors/supporters of the homes, including David Dubinsky, Leon Blum, Jacob Pat, and others. In addition, there are several hundred portrait photographs of individual children supported by the Committee through its Child Adoption program. The collection also includes images of Yiddish libraries, schools, and cultural centers financed by the Committee in Europe and in Israel, photographs of performances by two Yiddish/Jewish theater groups in postwar Germany (the Baderekh Theater in Berlin and the "Mit" Theater in Munich), images of displaced persons camps, and of the activities (demonstrations, summer camps, performances) of European organizations allied with the Committee, such as the Jewish Labor Bund, Left Poalei Zion, and SKIF (the youth arm of the Bund).</p><p>The collection is arranged and subdivided as follows: <list><head>Series I-General Activities, 1930s To 1980s:</head><item>Subseries A: Establishment of JLC and Early Activities</item><item>Subseries B: Holocaust and Jewish Life in Europe Under the Nazis</item><item>Subseries C: Postwar Aid Activities</item><item>Subseries D: Anti-Discrimination and Pro-Human Rights Activities</item><item>Subseries E: Other Postwar Activities</item><item>Subseries F: JLC Staff, Branches, Chapters, Divisions, and Committees</item><item>Subseries G: Miscellaneous</item></list></p><p><list><head>Series II-Personalities:</head><item>Subseries A: JLC Leadership</item><item>Subseries B: General</item></list> </p><p><list><head>Series III-Aid to Children:</head><item>Subseries A: Child Adoption Program</item><item>Subseries B: European Orphanages and Children's Homes and Other Child Aid Activities (except for France)</item><item>Subseries C: Children's Homes and Orphanages and Other Child Aid Activities in France</item></list> </p><p><list><head>Series IV, Oversized Albums and Panorama Portraits</head><item/></list> </p><p>Folder labels denote series, subseries, individual folder numbers, and topic. For example, the folder entitled "Wartime food and clothing drives and other activities" is labeled as follows: I-A-3: Wartime food and clothing drives and other activities (i.e. Series I, Subseries A, Folder 3).</p><p>In addition, two appendices provide more information on the contents of the collection. They consist of a partial guide to photographs of prominent individuals represented in Series I of the collection (see Appendix 1; Series II: Personalities also has photographs of the same and other individuals), and a list of translations of the Yiddish captions/annotations for nearly all the images that have such notations --a total of approximately 1700 photographs (see Appendix 2).</p>  </scopecontent>

of human rights, as well as the JLC's work of combatting antisemitism worldwide. The majority of the photographs are of labor conferences on civil rights in Chicago and other United States cities, National Trade Union Council anti-discrimination activities, and rallies in support of the rights of Soviet Jewry. Individual folders document the work of JLC local chapters for these causes. There are also several pictures of JLC protest rallies and conferences on behalf of Polish Jews.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref82" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>JLC
