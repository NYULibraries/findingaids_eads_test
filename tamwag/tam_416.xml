    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Asian CineVision (ACV) is a non-profit media arts organization that develops, promotes and preserves media made by or about peoples of Asian descent. Asian CineVision was founded by grassroots media activists in New York's Chinatown in 1976 to raise social and cultural awareness of the Asian American experience, both in the Asian American community and among the general public. Founders Tsui Hark, Christine Choy, Thomas Tam, Danny Yung and Peter Chow, and others also sought to raise awareness through media training in the local Chinese community. The organization sought to address problems of media access for Asian Americans and also to present and publicize the work of Asian American artists. The organization initiated the weekly, cable-access Chinese Cable Television (CCTV) in 1977, which covered a broad range of community-interest issues such as local politics, education, language, housing, labor and healthcare. Significantly, it was the first Chinese-language news program in the U.S. Production of CCTV ceased in 1983. Beginning in 1978, it has sponsored the Asian American (AIIFF) International Film Festival. In 1981, Asian CineVision assumed publication of <emph render="italic">Bridge</emph> magazine, a quarterly journal documenting the development of a pan-Asian American political and cultural identity previously published by the group Basement Workshop. <emph render="italic">Bridge</emph> ceased publication in 1986 and was replaced by the Asian American media arts journal <emph render="italic">CineVue</emph>. Through these and other programs, Asian CineVision supports Asian and Asian American mediamakers and presents their works to the Asian American community and wider audiences.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Processing decisions made prior to 2014 have not been recorded. </p><p>In 2014, the archived websites were added as Series V. The original finding aid was reformatted from a Word document to EAD in 2014.</p><p>In 2017, three boxes of inventories and festival programs were added to Series I: Administrative Files as boxes 311-313. Two floppy disks included in this donation were inventoried and forensically imgaged.</p><p>In 2018, two boxes of festival programs, publications, and office files were removed from hanging folders and rehoused in acid-free boxes.  At the time of accessioning, these materials were added to the file list in Series I: Administrative Files. They have not been arranged by the archivist and are in the order in which they were received by the donor.</p><p>In 2019-2020, the archived websites were added to the finding aid.</p><p>In 2020, 109 tapes from Series III, Sub-series A were digitized and described on the file level. </p><p>In 2021, some narrative description was edited to more accurately describe the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. Creator-supplied titles containing harmfully euphemistic language regarding the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II were identified, but have been retained to convey important contextual information regarding time and place in which the documents and titles were created.</p><p>
