The majority of the narrators lived in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Other narrators include residents of the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan; members of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York; veterans of the Vietnam War; and jazz musicians in New York City between 1940 and 1960.  The narrators reflect the changing ethnic composition of different neighborhoods in New York City, and include Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe; immigrants from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America; and migrants from the southern United States and Puerto Rico.  Topics covered by the interviews include life in tenements in the LES, life in public and cooperative housing in the LES, family life, ethnic identities, intercultural and interracial relations in New York City, education, religion, paid and unpaid work, immigration and migration experiences, religious and social activities in East Harlem, Asian American activism, socialist and anarchist organizations, political activism, anti-war movements, community gardens in New York City, and experiences of women in higher education through the 1970s and 1990s.  In addition to the interviews, the collection includes transcripts (full and partial) of interviews, notes on and indexes of interviews, field notes taken by interviewers, and preliminary questionnaires completed by narrators.  Some files include articles and ephemera created by the narrators or are related to the topics they discussed in the interviews.</abstract>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The initial phase of planning for processing of this collection assumed that the entire collection was related to the Lower East Side Oral History Project.  Once processing work started on the collection, it was determined that roughly one quarter of the interviews did not relate to the Lower East Side.  The decision was made to keep the collection together based on the fact that the interviews were conducted by members of the oral history classes taught by Rachel Bernstein and that they would be arranged with the Lower East Side Oral History Project interviews in one series and interviews conducted by other oral history classes arranged in their own discrete series.</p><p>30 interviews in the collection were described using existing transcripts. The remaining interviews were described after listening to at least 45 minutes of audio per interview; this included the first 20 minutes of each interview, as well as an additional 10-25 minutes throughout the recording.</p><p>The 30 interviews in Series IV were added to the collection in May 2017 but were not described at the interview level.</p><p>In 2021, narrative description was edited to more accurately describe the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. </p><p>Researchers can access previous versions of the finding aid in our GitHub repository at https://github.com/NYULibraries/findingaids_eads/commits/master/tamwag/oh_033.xml.</p>  </processinfo>

The interviews document life and work in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York throughout the 20th century.  The narrators lived and worked in the LES between the 1910s and 1990s and are mainly Jewish first-generation Americans of Eastern European descent.  Other narrators include immigrants and children of immigrants from Eastern Europe, Ireland, and Italy; African-American migrants and children of migrants from the southern United States; and a child of migrants from Puerto Rico.  </p><p>The interviews include descriptions of apartments in tenements and public housing and neighborhoods in the LES, discussions of single and dual parent households and divorce in the early 20th century, and relations between Jewish residents of the LES with other ethnic and religious groups in the neighborhood.  Narrators discuss social and leisure activities in the LES, including the Yiddish theatre, and discuss the importance of the settlement houses to residents of the LES.  Narrators describe paid and unpaid work inside and outside of the home, immigration and migration experiences, labor union activity, and political activism.  Many of the interviews contain discussions surrounding Jewish identity in terms of religious and cultural traditions, in particular narrators comparing their experiences as first-generation Americans with their parents' experiences as immigrants.  </p><p>The interviews conducted in 1991 focus on the Henry Street Settlement in the LES.  The narrators were staff, board members, teachers and former students of the Music School, participants in the Home Planning Workshop, and members of the Henry Street Oldtimers.  These interviews cover a wide range of topics relating to the Settlement and the LES, with the majority focusing on the narrators' memories of staff, programs, activities, and events at the Settlement between the 1910s and the 1940s and the importance of the Settlement to the residents of the LES.  Many of the narrators discuss their memories of Helen Hall, the director of the Settlement between 1933 and 1967.  The narrators include early residents of the Vladeck Houses in the LES who compare the apartments as they were in 1940 and at the time of the interview. </p><p>The interviews conducted in 1993 focus on life in the tenements in the LES between the 1910s and the 1930s.  The interviews include vivid descriptions of the layouts of the apartments and living arrangements within them.  Narrators describe the neighborhoods and stores in the LES and discuss education and social activities in the LES.</p><p>In addition to the interviews, this series includes transcripts (full and partial) of interviews, notes on and indexes of interviews, field notes taken by interviewers, and preliminary questionnaires completed by narrators.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_24e9c04164f256d997a21057bdc49593"><head>Historical Note</head><p>The Lower East Side Oral History Project was undertaken between 1991 and 1994 to document life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Graduate students enrolled in the oral history classes taught by Rachel Bernstein in the New York University Department of History collaborated with the Tenement Museum, Henry Street Settlement House, and the Workmen's Circle in Manhattan to collect interviews with people who lived in the LES between the 1910s and 1990s.  Most of the interviews were conducted by graduate students in Bernstein's classes with some interviews conducted in 1993 by volunteers from the Workmen's Circle, who were trained by Bernstein in two day-long seminars.  The interviews conducted by the Workmen's Circle volunteers were used in planning the design of the Tenement Museum at 97 Orchard Street in the LES.</p></bioghist><arrangement id="aspace_08a2e34d2f265134f0e8bd504b98fff1"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in alphabetical order by last name of  narrator.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref109" level="file"><did><unittitle>Arinberg, Pauline</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/45150</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1993/1993">1993 May 21</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_fbc85f7f9c9180e90f0ec8bbf5c129f4" label="Mixed Materials [31142063272317]" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_b08686e4a2c9169d67f10322450889a4" parent="aspace_fbc85f7f9c9180e90f0ec8bbf5c129f4" type="Folder">1</container><container altrender="Hollinger Cassette Box 9.5" id="aspace_5e21947bb2e37ebd53c9db0c7ce00c53" label="Audio [31142054612539]" type="Box">15</container><container id="aspace_702a08b0d3801e409a326748714dd52f" parent="aspace_5e21947bb2e37ebd53c9db0c7ce00c53" type="Cassette">115</container><container altrender="Media Box 5.5" id="aspace_89cea74209faa15051760a70b1835f08" label="Audio [31142063291101]" type="Box">6</container><container id="aspace_bee246a576b9c2312400f480b6daa220" parent="aspace_89cea74209faa15051760a70b1835f08" type="CD">18</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_916e493c39ac53d31b656ae49bc31844"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Pauline Arinberg was born in the early 20th century in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.

The majority of the interview covers Norman Shapiro's family's winery.  Shapiro recalls thousands of people lining up outside the winery during Passover in order to purchase wine.  He states that since the opening of their store, his family made and sold their own wine.  Shapiro explains that he was 12 years old when he first started working at the family winery in order to assist with bottling the wine.  He suggests that, at the time of the interview, the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan had changed from a primarily Jewish neighborhood to include people from Puerto Rico and China.  Shapiro argues that people were happier during the 1940s and 1960s because their families lived closeby and were able to share in traditions like the Passover seder.  He expresses his opinion that the LES has been affected negatively with the shift of immigrant populations.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_d2a27076e6927731e0ac35db04f62025"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Duration:  1:08:27</p></phystech></c><c id="aspace_ref77" level="file"><did><unittitle>Shulman, Simon</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/45270</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1993/1993">1993 April 28</unitdate><container altrender="Hollinger Cassette Box 9.5" id="aspace_03c37e404e7e65cfa970a77858b5dab9" label="Audio [31142054612547]" type="Box">14</container><container id="aspace_0e728c60feca4ca88d829d27b0f26942" parent="aspace_03c37e404e7e65cfa970a77858b5dab9" type="Cassette">83</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_bd3f10f12e7f9fad410418fb0ff9de6c" label="Mixed Materials [31142063272317]" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_6df46036317c0bdf13c892af543f5cf9" parent="aspace_bd3f10f12e7f9fad410418fb0ff9de6c" type="Folder">96</container><container altrender="Media Box 5.5" id="aspace_46ce0d34f7f2c9f1a976c74fdfffc284" label="Audio [31142063291085]" type="Box">5</container><container id="aspace_e2e619457b3447409b9216df4a82275d" parent="aspace_46ce0d34f7f2c9f1a976c74fdfffc284" type="CD">19</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_f9ac2ef77d2f7d194f01f09c09d38859"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Simon Shulman was born in 1900 in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.
