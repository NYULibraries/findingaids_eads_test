      <abstract id="aspace_092053c521e083fd3b7f87d81deaf10b">The New York University (NYU) Department of History Oral History Class Collection contains over 180 sound and video interviews conducted by graduate students from the NYU Department of History in 1984, between 1991 and 1995, in 1999, and by volunteers from the Workmen's Circle in Manhattan, New York in 1993.  The majority of the narrators lived in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Other narrators include residents of the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan; members of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York; veterans of the Vietnam War; and jazz musicians in New York City between 1940 and 1960.  The narrators reflect the changing ethnic composition of different neighborhoods in New York City, and include Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe; immigrants from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America; and migrants from the southern United States and Puerto Rico.  Topics covered by the interviews include life in tenements in the LES, life in public and cooperative housing in the LES, family life, ethnic identities, intercultural and interracial relations in New York City, education, religion, paid and unpaid work, immigration and migration experiences, religious and social activities in East Harlem, Asian American activism, socialist and anarchist organizations, political activism, anti-war movements, community gardens in New York City, and experiences of women in higher education through the 1970s and 1990s.  In addition to the interviews, the collection includes transcripts (full and partial) of interviews, notes on and indexes of interviews, field notes taken by interviewers, and preliminary questionnaires completed by narrators.  Some files include articles and ephemera created by the narrators or are related to the topics they discussed in the interviews.</abstract>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>The initial phase of planning for processing of this collection assumed that the entire collection was related to the Lower East Side Oral History Project.  Once processing work started on the collection, it was determined that roughly one quarter of the interviews did not relate to the Lower East Side.  The decision was made to keep the collection together based on the fact that the interviews were conducted by members of the oral history classes taught by Rachel Bernstein and that they would be arranged with the Lower East Side Oral History Project interviews in one series and interviews conducted by other oral history classes arranged in their own discrete series.</p>
      <p>30 interviews in the collection were described using existing transcripts. The remaining interviews were described after listening to at least 45 minutes of audio per interview; this included the first 20 minutes of each interview, as well as an additional 10-25 minutes throughout the recording.</p>
      <p>The 30 interviews in Series IV were added to the collection in May 2017 but were not described at the interview level.</p>
      <p>In 2021, narrative description was edited to more accurately describe the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. </p>

The majority of the narrators lived in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Other narrators lived in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan or were members of the Asian American political movements or the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York.  The narrators reflect the changing ethnic composition of different neighborhoods in New York City, and include Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe; immigrants from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America; and migrants from the southern United States and Puerto Rico.

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series contains interviews conducted between 1991 and 1994 as part of the Lower East Side Oral History Project.  The interviews document life and work in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York throughout the 20th century.  The narrators lived and worked in the LES between the 1910s and 1990s and are mainly Jewish first-generation Americans of Eastern European descent.  Other narrators include immigrants and children of immigrants from Eastern Europe, Ireland, and Italy; African-American migrants and children of migrants from the southern United States; and a child of migrants from Puerto Rico.  </p>
          <p>The interviews include descriptions of apartments in tenements and public housing and neighborhoods in the LES, discussions of single and dual parent households and divorce in the early 20th century, and relations between Jewish residents of the LES with other ethnic and religious groups in the neighborhood.  Narrators discuss social and leisure activities in the LES, including the Yiddish theatre, and discuss the importance of the settlement houses to residents of the LES.  Narrators describe paid and unpaid work inside and outside of the home, immigration and migration experiences, labor union activity, and political activism.  Many of the interviews contain discussions surrounding Jewish identity in terms of religious and cultural traditions, in particular narrators comparing their experiences as first-generation Americans with their parents' experiences as immigrants.  </p>
          <p>The interviews conducted in 1991 focus on the Henry Street Settlement in the LES.  The narrators were staff, board members, teachers and former students of the Music School, participants in the Home Planning Workshop, and members of the Henry Street Oldtimers.  These interviews cover a wide range of topics relating to the Settlement and the LES, with the majority focusing on the narrators' memories of staff, programs, activities, and events at the Settlement between the 1910s and the 1940s and the importance of the Settlement to the residents of the LES.  Many of the narrators discuss their memories of Helen Hall, the director of the Settlement between 1933 and 1967.  The narrators include early residents of the Vladeck Houses in the LES who compare the apartments as they were in 1940 and at the time of the interview. </p>
          <p>The interviews conducted in 1993 focus on life in the tenements in the LES between the 1910s and the 1930s.  The interviews include vivid descriptions of the layouts of the apartments and living arrangements within them.  Narrators describe the neighborhoods and stores in the LES and discuss education and social activities in the LES.</p>
          <p>In addition to the interviews, this series includes transcripts (full and partial) of interviews, notes on and indexes of interviews, field notes taken by interviewers, and preliminary questionnaires completed by narrators.</p>

          <p>The Lower East Side Oral History Project was undertaken between 1991 and 1994 to document life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Graduate students enrolled in the oral history classes taught by Rachel Bernstein in the New York University Department of History collaborated with the Tenement Museum, Henry Street Settlement House, and the Workmen's Circle in Manhattan to collect interviews with people who lived in the LES between the 1910s and 1990s.  Most of the interviews were conducted by graduate students in Bernstein's classes with some interviews conducted in 1993 by volunteers from the Workmen's Circle, who were trained by Bernstein in two day-long seminars.  The interviews conducted by the Workmen's Circle volunteers were used in planning the design of the Tenement Museum at 97 Orchard Street in the LES.</p>

Buloff states that after immigrating to the US, she continued to act, that her entire life was related to theatre, and that she did not socialize outside of the troupe.  Buloff described 2nd Avenue in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York as lively due to the large volume of Yiddish theatres and high attendance of each show.  She explains that by the 1940s, she thought that the Yiddish theatre had become too commercialized, which led her to move to Chicago, Illinois.  Buloff explains that she felt that the New York Yiddish theatre became less about the art of acting and more about profits and fame.</p>

The majority of the interview covers Nellie Dick's recollections of anarchist communities in London, England; New York; and New Jersey.   Dick recalls attending a lecture given by Johann Rudolf Rocker in London when she was eight or nine years old and being the only child present at the lecture.  She explains that her immersion into politics at a young age resulted in her dedicated involvement in the anarchist community.  Dick goes into detail about what she considers to be the fundamental differences between anarchists and Communists, one being the belief that there should be a bit of a hierarchy to the working and social structure of a community.  She describes teaching herself to read Yiddish and her eagerness to learn.  Dick recalls working closely with her fellow principals at the Modern School to write the <emph render="italic">Voice of the Children</emph>, a Stelton Colony publication.  As leaders of the Ferrer Colony, Nellie and her husband each proposed and carried out projects to better the community, including better living conditions for the boarding school students and improvements to school buildings.  She explains that not only did the students attend classes at the school, they were also responsible for maintaining the grounds of the school.  Dick describes teaching her students manners as she strongly believed in etiquette and discipline.  Dick expresses her adoration for the Stelton Colony and her pride as a contributing leader of that community, as she was a proponent of always improving the community.  She also explains the colony's mission, which expresses the importance of responsibility in order to have freedom, and the living atmosphere of the Ferrer Colony.  Dick explains that she knew she belonged within the Ferrer Colony because she shared the outstanding belief that there should be a change in government and that all individuals should receive an education.</p>

            <p>This interview was conducted on October 15, 1991 by Timothy W. Allison at Phebe Thorne Marrin's apartment in Manhattan, New York.  The interview covers Marrin's experiences as a member of the Board of Directors at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and her working life.  Marrin discusses the beginning of her involvement with the Henry Street Settlement as a volunteer in the Drama Department and Pete's House Productions working with Joseph Balfior.  She discusses ethnic and racial tensions in the LES and the ways in which the staff of the Drama Department sought to teach the children and teenagers how to resolve them.  She recounts her idea to coordinate the drama, dance, and music programs as a unified arts program at the Settlement and the fact that this led to her invitation to join the Board of Directors in 1966.  She explains that she became involved in fundraising activities, continued with her drama classes, and worked as a nurse until she had children and no longer had time to dedicate to volunteering.  She recounts her decisions to leave her nursing position in 1973, to become a lobbyist in Albany for a state senator for ten years, and to enroll in law school at Pace University in Manhattan.

            <p>This interview was conducted on October 31, 1992 by Christine Halvorson at the Muste Building, headquarters of the War Resisters' League, in Manhattan, New York.  The majority of this interview covers Mitch Miller's research on twentieth century anarchism in New York, specifically in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, as well as in Europe.  He discusses the decline of the Yiddish language, the Spanish Civil War, and compares anarchism in the period between the 1950s and 1970s to politics in the United States (US) at the time of the interview.  Miller describes the Lower East Side to be located below Fourteenth Street and East of Second Avenue.  He references the book, Fragments, written by Sam Dolgoff throughout his interview and relates that Dolgoff played an active role in the anarchist movement during the twentieth century in the Lower East Side (LES).  Miller explains the tension between various ethnic groups in the LES, including gang fights between Jewish, Irish, and Italian residents and relates his opinion that between 1900 and 1940 neighborhoods were the center of people's lives.</p>

            <p>This interview was conducted on April 17, 1994 by Karen Baker at Shapiro's Premium Kosher Wines at 125 Rivington Street in Manhattan, New York.  The majority of the interview covers Norman Shapiro's family's winery.  Shapiro recalls thousands of people lining up outside the winery during Passover in order to purchase wine.  He states that since the opening of their store, his family made and sold their own wine.  Shapiro explains that he was 12 years old when he first started working at the family winery in order to assist with bottling the wine.  He suggests that, at the time of the interview, the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan had changed from a primarily Jewish neighborhood to include people from Puerto Rico and China.  Shapiro argues that people were happier during the 1940s and 1960s because their families lived closeby and were able to share in traditions like the Passover seder.  He expresses his opinion that the LES has been affected negatively with the shift of immigrant populations.</p>

            <p>This interview was conducted on November 30, 1991 by John S. Berman at Rose Singer's apartment in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  The interview covers Singer's experiences in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and at the Henry Street Settlement in the LES, particularly as a member of the Alcott Club.  Singer describes the Vladeck Houses in the LES and recounts moving there in 1940.  She discusses her membership in the Alcott Club at the Henry Street Settlement, her participation in other events and activities at the Settlement, and her friends at the Settlement.  She explains that she developed confidence through these activities at the Settlement.  She discusses her early life in the LES, her unhappiness at moving to the neighborhood as a teenager after the death of her father, and compares the LES with Yonkers in the 1920s and 1930s.  She recounts her early working life in the early 1930s as a children's clothing inspector and the working conditions in the factory in which she worked.  She discusses her parents and the ways in which her mother supported the family after her husband's death in 1927.  </p>
            <p>Singer discusses her involvement in the Henry Street Settlement in the LES and recounts her first memories of the Settlement in the 1930s.  She discusses the settlement houses' social programs and the ways in which they benefited the LES.  She discusses the sense of community she felt at the Henry Street Settlement and the freedom she felt being away from her young children and her husband for a short time.  She explains that her husband at first resented her involvement with the Settlement, his resentment at having to care for their children while she went out, and her resentment of his leisure activities and the double-standard that existed in their family.  She describes holiday activities at the Settlement, in particular the fact that the different ethnic and religious groups at the Settlement would work together to create inclusive events before Irish and Italian members formed separate groups based on ethnic identities.  She describes the Settlement programs in which the Alcott Club took a particular interest, including working for better housing in the LES, a cooperative milk program, and clothing swaps.  Other topics include her memories of the Great Depression, discussion of her husband's working life, and her memories of Helen Hall.</p>

            <p>This interview was conducted on November 14, 1992 by Sharon B. Laist at Sally Spiro Stern's apartment in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  The interview includes both audio and video recordings.  The majority of the interview covers Stern's memories of her family, in particular her grandfather, Louis Borgenicht and her father, Jack D. Spiro.  Stern's description and opinions of her grandfather differ from what is expressed in Harold Friedman's biography of him, <emph render="italic">The Happiest Man: The Life of Louis Borgenicht</emph>.  She argues his book describes him as a positive, fair minded, and hardworking man when he was actually very unpleasant and cold.  Stern also argues that it was her grandmother who had the successful business ideas, not her grandfather.  She explains the emphasis on Jewish traditions in her family, including family dinners, marriage, and the importance of education.  Stern recalls the sense of community amongst Jewish people in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  She describes her first experience of anti-semitism at the University of Michigan in the mid 1940s.</p>

            <p>This interview was conducted on June 3, 1993 by Sylvia Groen at an unspecified location.  The majority of the interview covers Beverly Fischer Weinstein's childhood experiences being raised by her widowed mother in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  She vividly describes the family's apartment on Madison Street in the LES apartment and the fact that it was an entire floor of the building and a railroad style apartment.  Weinstein discusses the fact that their apartment was near her family's leather business.  She discusses her friends' reactions to her apartment and to the LES and their comparisons between the LES and  the neighborhoods in which they lived in upper Manhattan.  Weinstein recalls visiting the Educational Alliance and being a member of the Young Israel Synagogue of Manhattan.  She discusses the importance of family; weekly Sunday visits from relatives who lived in Newark, New Jersey; and her participation in many weddings.  She expresses pride in her education and work experiences and explains that she was glad she waited until she was about 30 years old to get married.  Weinstein states that she enjoyed her independence and argued that it allowed her to gain meaningful experiences which she might not have been able to have if she had gotten married and started a family at an earlier age.</p>

She explains her reasons for not practicing one particular religion and describes her belief in a greater force that is beyond the basic human existence.  L'Ouverture recalls experiencing discrimination in each place she lived due to her family being practitioners of Vodou.  She explains that the pantheon of Vodou brings her comfort and security.  She discusses her experiences in the various countries and states in which she lived prior to New York City.

              <p>This interview was conducted on October 4 and December 8, 1995 by Ellen Noonan at Julius Manson's apartment in the Stuyvesant Town residential complex in  Manhattan, New York.  The majority of the interview covers Manson's childhood in the Harlem and Lower East Side (LES) neighborhoods of Manhattan and his experience at the Three Arrows Cooperative Society (3A)  in Putnam Valley, New York.  Manson recalls playing in the street in the LES, in particular running underneath horses.  He describes the poverty of his family and their neighbors.  Manson explains various political and socialist philosophies, and discusses his memberships to the Young People's Socialist League, the War Resisters' League, 3A, and the Hebrew Free Loan Society.  He goes into detail about his financial struggles as a young adult and how he borrowed money from the Hebrew Free Loan Society who offered interest-free loans to its members.  He discusses in detail the fundamentals of the Hebrew Free Loan Society and the types of loans services they provided for its members.  Manson explains that he joined 3A because it required its members to accept cooperative living principles, like common ownership of property, and overall community involvement.  He describes giving public speeches to the 3A community as well as to neighborhoods in Manhattan.</p>

            <p>This interview was conducted by Kathleen Doherty in 1984 at an unspecified location.  The interview covers John Burke's working life.  Burke discusses his experiences working as a warehouseman at the Western Electric Kearny Works in Kearny, NJ between 1929 and 1931 and working odd jobs after he was laid off in 1931.  He recounts his first experiences working as a longshoreman, including the type of work that was available during the Great Depression and extortion of the new workers on the docks.  He discusses the formation of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local 1247.  He discusses the work patterns on the docks, the formation of work gangs, and pay rates for different types of cargo.  He recounts becoming a foreman and the difference in work for longshoreman and foremen.  He lists the different ports in which he worked: Hoboken, Jersey City, and Edgewater in New Jersey, and Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York.  He explains the ways in which information was disseminated about which ports had work.  Other topics include strikes and organized crime involvement in the ILA and on the docks.</p>
