    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At the time of accessioning, materials were rehoused in archival boxes. Loose documents and documents in hanging folders were rehoused in archival folders, maintaining their original order and titles (if existing). </p><p>The collection was processed and described by an archivist in the fall of 2024. Paper materials were kept in their archival folders and boxes. Materials were arranged into two series by topic. Since materials in Series I had already been divided into date ranges, during processing, they were kept in their current order of scripts and then research materials. </p><p>47 audiovisual items were assigned media ID numbers and housed appropriately. These materials were then intellectually incorporated into Series II. </p><p>New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. 592 optical discs were forensically imaged and analyzed using Isobusters. A floppy disk and flash drive were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged using Forensic Toolkit. The electronic records were intellectually incorporated into the finding aid. </p><p>For episodes listed in Series II, of the 523 full length episodes, 468 episodes had viewable digital copies that were reviewed. Short episode summaries were written and listed with each of the 468 episodes. This work was completed with the assistance of student workers. During the preservation process, it was also determined that of the 592 optical discs, 80 discs could not be imaged or viewed; 42 discs contained duplicate episodes; and four discs were determined to be unrelated to TWNR. All of these discs were removed from the collection.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Historical Note on <emph render="italic">Third World News Review</emph></head>
<p>Along with University of California, Santa Barbara student Corey Dubin, Cedric Robinson created <emph render="italic">Third World News Review</emph> (TWNR), a long-standing community-led radio show on KCSB 91.9 FM that provided a counter-narrative news source aimed at destabilizing the ways in which mainstream media outlets report on politics and foreign policy in the so-called Third World. Though TWNR was initiated by Cedric Robinson, Corey Dubin, and Gerard Pigeon, the show must be more fully understood as having been produced collectively. Elizabeth Robinson, alongside Beth Anderson, was TWNR's co-producer in both its radio and television program formats. The show invited a wide range of scholarly and activist dialogue, with numerous correspondents and guests over the life of TWNR. </p><p><emph render="italic">Third World News Review</emph> first aired in 1979 in the wake of what was known in Western media circles as the Iranian Hostage Crisis. Recognizing a general lack of understanding and awareness of international politics beyond the framing of U.S. imperialism amongst United States citizens, TWNR was born. The hour-long show ran weekly for 35 years and covered a range of subjects including the "Dirty War" in Argentina; the U.S. invasions of numerous Latin American countries; the Iraq War; the first and second intifadas in Palestine; the independence of Zimbabwe; and U.S. manipulation of elections in the Philippines, El Salvador, Afghanistan, and Venezuela. At every point in its three decades of production, TWNR supported global liberation movements — in particular, those in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. TWNR aired its last episode on October 26, 2015. </p>  </bioghist>
