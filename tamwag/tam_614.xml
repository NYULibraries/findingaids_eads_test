At its peak in 1922, the area had nearly 3000 residents, but by the 1950s many Chinese businesses and families had left the city and relocated to the suburbs.

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Yoland Skeete is one of the founding members of the Sumei Multidisciplinary Arts Center and the creator of Sumei's Newark Chinatown History project. Founded in 1993, the Sumei Multidisciplinary Arts Center has served as a platform for artists around the world to connect with communities in Newark. It supports emerging and established artists through exhibitions, lectures, seminars, workshops, and residencies. </p><p>Skeete initiated the Newark Chinatown History project upon discovering that Newark had once had a thriving Chinatown between the 1870s and the 1940s. At its peak in 1922, Newark's Chinatown was home to 3,000 residents but by the 1950s, they had dispersed as many families moved into New Jersey's suburbs. To recover the largely forgotten history of the neighborhood and the people who had once lived there, Skeete embarked on an archival and archaeological research project. As part of her research, she surveyed local churches, Newark's public libraries, the National Archives and Records Administration, and the New Jersey Historical Society for records and xeroxed or photographed documents to begin building a collection. She spearheaded an archeological dig of the area, unearthing privies and other objects from Newark's Chinatown, some of which are included in the collection. She also conducted oral histories of former residents and their descendants. Since building the collection, Skeete has organized various public programs at Sumei, including lectures, exhibits, and reunions of Newark Chinatown residents to raise awareness about these materials. </p>  </bioghist>
