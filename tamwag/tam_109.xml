    <abstract id="aspace_fc59c425ae09e6a954c6ab4c7c37d937">Charles James Hendley (1881-1962) was a teacher, education reform advocate, political activist and union leader.  A member of the Teachers Union of the City of New York from 1921 until his death, he served as its president from 1935-1945.

The Charles J. Hendley Papers give a glimpse into his personal life and document his career, his political activities and his varied interests.  The collection also provides a detailed look at the Teachers Union of the City of New York, tracing its history, internal and external conflicts, changing affiliations, and its efforts to bring about school reform as well as higher wages and better working conditions for its members.

Correspondence, meeting minutes, financial and administrative documents, memoranda, newsletters and a significant amount of Hendley's editorials and other writings are included in the collection.  The materials document educational issues of the 1930s, 40s and 50s; the impact of the Depression and World War II on New York City's schools; the relationship of the teachers with other unions, the civil rights movement, Popular Front political organizations and the American Labor Party; and threats to academic freedom from the Rapp-Coudert Committee investigations in the early 1940s and the post-war red scare which led to the harassment and firing of some of New York's teachers. Finally, there is a variety of publications, pamphlets, photographs and ephemera to provide additional historical context.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Charles James Hendley (1881-1962) was a teacher, education reform advocate, political activist and union leader.  A member of the Teachers Union of the City of New York (Teachers Union of NYC) from 1921 until his death, he served as its president from 1935-1945.</p><p>Born in North Carolina on June 4, 1881, Hendley was the son of Alvis Francis Hendley, a section foreman on the Southern Railway who was a pioneer in organizing the maintenance-of-way men on the southern railroads. After attending local schools, he graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1905.  He taught for several years in small towns in North Carolina then moved north in 1915 and taught in New Jersey and Pennsylvania before coming to New York. In 1919 he helped organize a local of the American Federation of Teachers in Paterson, New Jersey, and in 1920, worked for the State Federation of Labor in Pennsylvania, teaching labor classes in Bethlehem, Reading and Lancaster. Once in New York, he taught labor classes for Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and for a Wall Street local of telegraphers.</p><p>Hendley earned a masters degree at Columbia University and taught history and economics at George Washington High School in Manhattan from 1921 until 1946. A member of the Teachers Union of NYC, he served as its treasurer from 1922 through 1932 then became president in 1935 and held that position until just before his retirement from teaching.</p><p>In 1940, Hendley appeared before the Rapp-Coudert Committee.  Although under the threat of arrest and probable dismissal from his teaching position, he defied the Committee, refusing its request to turn over the Teachers Union membership list. In January of 1941, however, at the behest of the Executive Board, on advice of union counsel, he complied with the Committee's demands.</p><p>After his retirement, Hendley continued his association with the Union serving on the Executive Board, as a member of the Educational Policies Committee and as Director of the Teachers Union Institute.  In 1946, he became a field representative of the National Teachers Division of the United Public Workers of America (UPWA/CIO) and held that position until 1948. From his early years as a teacher, Hendley had been a member of the Socialist Party, resigning in 1938. He later grew closer to the Communist Party, apparently joining the Party in the late 1940s, but maintaining his oppostion to totalitarianism and authoritarianism in all forms.</p><p>In addition to his work with the Union, Hendley was active in the American Labor Party, running for State Senate (28th District, Bronx) in 1948 and for Congress (25th Congressional District) in 1950.  In his later years he was a stockholder and served as Secretary-Treasurer of Publishers New Press, Inc., publisher of <emph render="italic">The Daily Worker</emph>.  In that capacity he was called before the Senate Internal Security Committee in 1952 and also before a Grand Jury inquiry in 1962, consistently restating his belief in civil liberties for adherents of all political ideologies. </p><p>He remained active in his support of educational reform and other progressive causes. He wrote many articles, essays and letters to the editor; organized lectures; maintained throughout his life a keen interest in the political and cultural events of the day; and never lost his enthusiasm for learning.</p><p>Charles Hendley married Okla Dees of Grantboro, North Carolina, in 1916.  They had two sons, Charles and Daniel.</p><p>- - - - - - -</p><p>The history of the Teachers Union of the City of New York was marked by controversy and changing affiliations.  Organized in 1916 as Local 5 of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), it began its long struggles on behalf of civil liberties, increased salaries, reduced classroom size, tenure for teachers, improved pensions and increased state aid to education. By 1925, however, organized political factions began appearing within the local's ranks and controversy over the Communist leanings of several of the factions culminated in a major crisis in 1935.  The leadership petitioned the national office to investigate the local and hoped that the findings would allow them to reorganize without the Communist elements.  This plan failed to gain adequate support from the AFT National Convention and, as a result, eight hundred dissatisfied members left Local 5 to join a newly organized, independent Teachers Guild.  Charles Hendley, as a Socialist, was seen as a unifying figure when, in 1935, he took over the presidency of Local 5 and significantly expanded its membership.</p><p>Conflicts and disagreements continued however, and subsequent efforts to revoke Local 5's charter were finally successful in 1941. Although unaffiliated, the union continued to operate, initially attempting to rejoin the AFT but, eventually, in September of 1943, uniting with the State, County, Municipal Workers of America (SCMWA), a CIO union, as Local 555. In 1946, SCMWA allied with the United Federal Workers of America to become the United Public Workers of America (UPWA); the teachers continued as UPWA Local 555.  In 1950, the UPWA was expelled from the CIO for alleged Communist domination; the Teachers Union of NYC withdrew from the UPWA in 1952. After twelve years as an independent organization, the Teachers Union of NYC was dissolved with the recommendation that its members join the the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), which had become the official collective bargaining agent for the City's teachers.  The UFT had been formed as a result of the merger of the Teachers Guild with the Committee of Action through Unity (CATU) and strengthened after the first successful teachers' strike in New York City (May 1960.)</p><p>

Note</head><p>Subseries IIB contains a wide variety of notes, drafts and writing fragments. There are notebooks dating from 1928 through 1962 in which Hendley recorded everything from gardening tips and personal to-do lists to research on educational, labor and economics topics; outlines and draft portions of planned articles; meeting notes; lists of textbooks and citations; information gleaned from daily reading ofThe New York Times and other news sources (he also pasted in a number of clippings); and random jottings and ideas. Cards were used for many of his notes and also for names, addresses and information gleaned from canvassing he did in the Bronx on behalf of the American Labor Party.</p></scopecontent><c

Note</head><p>This series follows the history of the Union through its various affiliations. Each one of the first five subseries highlights activities, correspondence, financial and administrative material, communication with members, educational conferences, meeting minutes, publications and specific issues of importance associated with a particular period.</p><p>The first subseries, focusing on its AFT affiliation as Local 5, contains a good deal of material concerning conflicts within the local, competing internal factions, the 1935 walkout and formation of the rival Teachers Guild, and final expulsion from the AFT. Attempts to rejoin the AFT are documented in the second subseries, while the third reflects the Union's affiliation with the CIO. The next two subseries document the Union's continued affiliation with the United Public Workers of America after the UPWA was expelled from the CIO and its final years as an independent union, touching on such topics as school integration and responses to anti-communist investigations.
The last subseries highlights a number of special groups within the Union that were of particular interest to Charles Hendley - the Educational Policies Committee, the Teachers Union Institute and various political action committees. Also included is material reflecting the time Hendley spent, after his retirement from teaching, as an organizing field representative for the National Teachers Division of the UPWA/CIO.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref177" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries IIIA: Teachers Union of NYC, American Federation of Teachers (AFT), Local 5</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1925/1941" type="inclusive">1925-1941</unitdate></did><phystech id="aspace_743b5b77689e20925d6ce238a2ad4d73"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Due to the fragile nature of the originals, General Meeting Minutes and Membership Meeting Minutes in box 19 are accessible on microfilm only in the Tamiment reading room: Call Number R-7435 and R-7435A.</p></phystech><c id="aspace_ref178" level="file"><did><unittitle>Activities (Overviews)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_44001c299a437302c82b0f6aa0964129" label="Mixed Materials [31142051744228]" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_44001c299a437302c82b0f6aa0964129" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref180" level="file"><did><unittitle>Answer to Board of Examiners Recommendations Concerning Probationary Teachers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1941/1941" type="inclusive">1941</unitdate><container id="aspace_2be76fa56dbc7936f50e612e86fbabed" label="Mixed Materials [31142051744228]" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_2be76fa56dbc7936f50e612e86fbabed" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref181" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">Ching Chong and the School Commissioners, A Burlesque Operetta</emph>, Libretto by Mabel L.

and Content Note</head><p>This series focuses on challenges to academic freedom from the late 1930s through the late 1950s, emphasizing the Rapp-Coudert Committee investigations and post-war red scare. The impact of these efforts, particularly the harassment and dismissal of many teachers, is documented through correspondence, court documents, articles, pamphlets, newspaper clippings, and other material, much of it generated by the Teachers Union of NYC. Charles Hendley's own appearance before Rapp-Coudert is documented. Also included are a number of articles and publications of those opposing the Union, such as <emph render="italic">The Educational Signpost</emph> and  <emph render="italic">The Tablet</emph>.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref361" level="file"><did><unittitle>Academic Freedom: General</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1928/1949" type="inclusive">1928-1949</unitdate><container id="aspace_3ac4753b2876587f825ccef05b9efe98" label="Mixed Materials [31142051744269]" type="Box">10</container><container parent="aspace_3ac4753b2876587f825ccef05b9efe98" type="Folder">35</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref362" level="file"><did><unittitle>Academic Freedom: General</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1950-1961, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_19381d24dbb679f47e288c2eee68daa8" label="Mixed Materials [31142051744277]" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_19381d24dbb679f47e288c2eee68daa8" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref363" level="file"><did><unittitle>Feinberg Law</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1949-1953, undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_4d1aaf9438264f227ba342e8810e62af" label="Mixed Materials [31142051744277]" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_4d1aaf9438264f227ba342e8810e62af" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref364" level="file"><did><unittitle>Foes: <emph render="italic">The Educational Signpost</emph></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1938/1947" type="inclusive">1938-1947</unitdate><container id="aspace_6d90b6c9b5f733b45b4da89da9bfcddd" label="Mixed Materials [31142051744277]" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_6d90b6c9b5f733b45b4da89da9bfcddd" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref365" level="file"><did><unittitle>Foes: Various Publications</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1938/1953" type="inclusive">1938-1953</unitdate><container id="aspace_da075bee9280e92eda4a2e95f7d96991" label="Mixed Materials [31142051744277]" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_da075bee9280e92eda4a2e95f7d96991" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref366" level="file"><did><unittitle>Internal Security Committee of the U.S. Senate: Hendley Appearance</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1952/1952" type="inclusive">1952</unitdate><container id="aspace_48fea1810fc1ed57c02516257c2bcec8" label="Mixed Materials [31142051744277]" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_48fea1810fc1ed57c02516257c2bcec8" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref367" level="file"><did><unittitle>McNaboe Investigation and William Randolph Hearst</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1936/1936" type="inclusive">1936</unitdate><container id="aspace_23bcb3bf14aa517d7bf3f03ee8be6fef" label="Mixed Materials [31142051744277]" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_23bcb3bf14aa517d7bf3f03ee8be6fef" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref368" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rapp-Coudert Committee (New York State Joint Legislative Committee on the State Education System)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1940/1940" type="inclusive">1940</unitdate><container id="aspace_17559810a012cf1a184ed11ee77ebf98" label="Mixed Materials [31142051744277]" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_17559810a012cf1a184ed11ee77ebf98" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref369" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rapp-Coudert Committee</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Jan 1941 -

Examples include federal aid to education, the Spanish Civil War, anti-communism and red-baiting, civil rights and the segregation of schools, separation of church and state, reading retardation and education during wartime. Hendley's involvement in Socialism and in the Communist Party is reflected, including his association with  The Worker. Organizations such as the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the American Labor Party (ALP) and the National Education Association (NEA) are represented, along with smaller teacher associations and teacher unions outside the New York area. Files are included on individuals such as Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Morris Schappes and the Rosenbergs. There are many newpaper clippings, collected over thirty years, that document educational, political and labor issues. The series contains examples of many serials as well as pamphlets and other publications, including several of particular interest --  The Flivver King by Upton Sinclair,  On Scabs by Jack London, a small book of anti-Nazi humor, and  The Challenger, a comic with liberal superheroes published by the Interfaith Committee of the Protestant Digest in the mid-1940s.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref388" level="file"><did><unittitle>Amalgamated Textile Workers of America</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1919/1920" type="inclusive">1919-1920</unitdate><container id="aspace_4e31716901e5add02cdd6b5ba2d06a04" label="Mixed Materials [31142051744277]" type="Box">11</container><container parent="aspace_4e31716901e5add02cdd6b5ba2d06a04" type="Folder">26</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref389" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Federation of Labor (AFL) v.
