<p>The collection consists of records of International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, Local 1 of Brooklyn, New York and other locals it merged with, including Local 9 of Brooklyn, Local 41 of Woodside, Queens, and locals 21, 30, 31, 34, 37,  66 and 84. Materials and documents date from the 1880s to the 1990s and include ledger books, minutes, contracts, correspondence, photographs, scrapbooks, ephemera and audio recordings of meetings and conventions. Early ledgers of Locals 1 and 9 date from the 1880s to the 1930s and include minutes, dues records, expense and benefits books and apprentice lists. The collection also contains the archived website of Local 1, with captures ongoing since 2012.  Photographs include portraits of individual members, union events, and group portraits of union members from the 1920s to the 1980s. A 1940s-era scrapbook from Local 41 includes head shots and group portraits of union members and related clippings. A photograph album that appears to date from the 1920s-1930s includes approximately 105 small black and white head shots of union members with names written in pencil under each.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Photographs were separated from this collection in 1999 and were established as a separate collection, the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, Local 0001 (Apprenticeship and Training Program) Photographs (PHOTOS 082). In 2013, the photograph collection was reincorporated into International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, Local 1 Records and Photographs WAG 118.</p><p>In 2014, the archived website was added as a series.</p><p>Decisions regarding arrangement, description, and physical interventions for this collection prior to 2019 are unknown. In 2019, materials were rehoused in new acid-free folders and boxes with spacers in preparation for offsite storage.  Material in the following boxes were rehoused into multiple boxes:  box 9 was split into boxes 9, 50, and 51; box 10 was split into boxes 10 and 52; box 13 was split into boxes 13 and 53; box 14 was split into boxes 14 and 54; box 27 was split into boxes 27, 56, and 57; box 38 was split into boxes 38, 58, and 59; box 40 was split into boxes 40 and 60; and box 47 was split into boxes 47 and 61.  In rehousing the collection, mold was found in some boxes and materials were quarantined as necessary.</p><p>Local 1's website was archived to the Internet Archive using the Archive-It service.

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The National Union of Bricklayers of the U.S.A. was organized on October 16, 1865 and granted a charter to Local No. 1 in Brooklyn, New York, on October 17, 1868, making Local 1 one of the oldest continuously-existing locals in New York City. The National Union of Bricklayers was one of the first unions to support the eight-hour work day, a priority for delegates from its New York locals to its 1869 Convention. In 1881, the National Union of Bricklayers became an international union. A reorganized charter was granted in 1910 when the International became Bricklayers, Masons, and Plasterers International Union of America. In 1916, the union became affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. From its beginnings the union emphasized apprenticeship training, wages, working conditions, and benefits for union members and their families. </p><p>The union's records illustrate the early dominance of Irish American and Irish immigrant members in the union -- many of them sons of bricklayers. In the 1930s and 1940s members from Irish and Italian ethnic backgrounds clashed, as Irish membership dwindled, and Italian members brought in more family members. By the mid-1980s, union operations were run at the district and international level, rather than at the local level, and local politics and power became less important. In 1986, Local 1 had 447 members, half of whom were African American and Latino, and the remainder were mostly of Italian origin. During the 1980s and 1990s, the International operated a federally-funded program called the Job Corps for Disadvantaged Youth, which trained female as well as male apprentices for Local 1.</p><p>Since its founding, Local 1 merged with several other locals, including locals 9, 21, 30, 31, 34, 37, 41, 66 and 84. Local 1's members have worked on New York City landmarks such as Grand Central Station, the Chrysler Building, the Metropolitan Life Building, the American Museum of Natural History, Lincoln Center, the Cloisters, the Frick Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and thousands of office and residential buildings.</p><p><emph render="bold">Sources:</emph></p><p>Bates, Harry. <emph render="italic">Bricklayers' Century of Craftsmanship: A History of the Bricklayers, Masons and Plasterers' International Union of America. </emph> Washington, D.C.: Bricklayers, Masons and Plasterers' International Union of America Washington, D.C., 1955.</p><p>Hommel, Claudia.
