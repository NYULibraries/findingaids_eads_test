    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>District 1 of the Communications Workers of America is comprised of New York, New Jersey, New England. In its early years, immediately after the founding and consolidation of the CWA (1947-1951), the District was made up primarily of telephone workers. It was the nerve center and power base of the national union, whose early leaders and first president, Joseph Beirne, had come from the New York Metropolitan Area. Under District Director Mary Hanscomb the District gained steadily in size, but the biggest leap in numbers and political clout came when District organizer Morton Bahr (formerly president of Local 1172) and several associates succeeded in bringing in 24,000 workers of the New York Telephone Company (later NYNEX and still later part of Verizon). As a result of this campaign the membership of the District more than doubled. The two biggest locals in District 1, Local 1101 (New York Tel) and Local 1150 (AT&amp;T Long-Lines) carried considerable weight in the affairs of the union nationally. Bahr served as New York State Director from 1961 to 1963, and assistant to District 1 Director George Miller from 1963 to 1969. During the 1960s Bahr and Miller fought off several attempts by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to raid CWA locals, and oversaw the beginnings of what was to be a crucial area of expansion for CWA, the organizing of public workers.</p><p>Morton Bahr succeeded Miller in 1969 and assumed the new title of Vice-President for District 1. As the organizing gains of the 1960s were carried forward, tensions within the bargaining process began to make themselves felt throughout the telephone sector of the union.</p><p>In the summer of 1971 the CWA launched a strike against New York Telephone, which left lingering bitter feelings between the union and the Company. In addition, key elements in the District held out stubbornly in a "wild-cat" protest against President Beirne's initial attempts to reach a settlement in the strike, and the conflict stretched to 218 days. The settlement of the strike paved the way for national bargaining in telephone -- a long-held goal of the CWA -- finally achieved in 1974.</p><p>The present headquarters of the District, at 80 Pine St. in lower Manhattan was established in 1972. Vice-President Bahr served on the union's Bell System Bargaining Committee, and led the District's highly effective lobbying efforts in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. He has said that the CWA was the most politically influential union the New York State during the 1980s.</p><p>In 1983 the huge International Operating Center in Manhattan was closed, resulting in a major lay-off of traffic workers. This was only one effect of the court-ordered AT&amp;T divestiture, which took full effect in 1984, and resulted in major company restructuring and changes in working conditions.</p><p>Jan Pierce, formerly CWA Area Director for Upstate New York, served as assistant to Morton Bahr, and succeeded to the position of District Vice-President, when Bahr became national president of CWA in 1985. Pierce, known for his militant approach to labor issues, presided over the aftermath of divestiture at AT&amp;T and beginnings of the sweeping change in the telephone industry, change that was to bring drastic downsizing and the transfer of much of the industry away from the urban centers of the Northeast. Larry Mancino took over as Vice-President of District 1, then numbering some 120,000 in its ranks, in 1996. Under Mancino the make-up of district membership continued to diversify, and increased through the merger of the CWA and several smaller unions. The district came to include nurses, librarians, clerical workers, television and radio technicians, and journalists in the private sector, as well as tens of thousands of state and local public workers.</p>  </bioghist>

id="aspace_30bd2963547d41ac8993546dbb2f7392"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>District 1 of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) includes 327 CWA local unions in New York, New Jersey, New England, and eastern Canada. Members are employed in many different sectors of the economy including, telecommunications; health care; higher education; manufacturing; broadcast and cable television; commercial printing and newspapers; state, local, and country government. The earliest crawl of this website dates back to 2007 and focused mostly on news from the union, the CWA convention, and District One's involvement in the CWA's Committee on Political Education, and the campaign to stop the sale of Verizon in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire. Captures from 2009 and 2010 focus on bargaining updates with AT&amp;T Mobility, healthcare reform, layoffs at Verizon, and a campaign against E-Z Pass which refused to acknowledge unionized workers at one of their call centers. In late 2010, the website underwent a redesign highlighting news from District 1, leadership, photos and videos from conventions and rallies, bargaining updates, and political activism and endorsements. From 2010-2016, District 1 focused on campaigns related to the sale of T-Mobile, unionization of agents at Piedmont Airlines, E-Z Pass workers in Staten Island, the New Jersey chapter, bargaining with Verizon, Hurricane Sandy Relief Fund, increased staffing for healthcare workers in hospitals and nursing homes, the CWA Joe Beirne Foundation, and the Take On Wall Street campaign to work on reforms beyond the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act. In circa 2016-2017 the website was redesigned again. From 2016-2020 he website had a a focus on member benefits; bargaining with AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T Mobility, Verizon, and Catholic Health; CWA Strong national plan; videos and photos from rallies; press releases and other news; legislative-political coordinators; political endorsements; and COVID-19 resources.</p><p>In 2021, the union established a new domain and underwent a redesign.  The new website contains news and press releases; legislative agenda; political endorsements in New York and New Jersey; federal political action efforts; mobilization and bargaining efforts at Verizon, AT&amp;T Mobility, and Catholic Health; COVID-19 pandemic updates and vaccine information; petitions; and the Red on Thursdays campaign.</p><p>Catholic Health Workers United is the organizing and strike website for the Communication Workers of America District 1 Local 1133 related to the bargaining and strike in 2022. Bargaining with the Catholic Health began in 2021 and the strike began on October 1, 2021. They called for safe staffing levels, wage increases, preserving retirement benefits, and keeping healthcare costs low. On November 4, they agreed on a contract. The website contains bargaining updates, open letters to management and Buffalo patients, Mercy Hospital strike information and logistics, and other news and press releases.</p><p>Communications Workers of America (CWA) District 1 New Jersey represents more than 70,000 families in New Jersey, including more than 40,000 state workers, 15,000 county and local government workers, and thousands of workers in the telecommunications and direct-care industries. Capture of the website began in 2007. In August 2011, CWA and IBEW workers went on strike against Verizon on the East Coast and New Jersey. The website contains bargaining agreements, contacts, VWXY employees, news from New Jersey locals, political endorsements, and other news from the union.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_128ad905cedd51fea34ebd220b76416c"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl.
