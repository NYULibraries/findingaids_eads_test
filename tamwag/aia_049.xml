    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Daniel Cassidy (1943-2008), an Irish-American writer, singer, filmmaker, and professor, was born in Brooklyn in 1943.  He attended the the New York Military Academy on a musical scholarship, and studied English Literature and Creative Writing at Cornell University.  His first job was at the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, which he left to pursue screenwriting full time.  From the late 1960s through the 1980s, Cassidy performed as a musician, but gradually transitioned into composing his own music.  He performed at, among other places, Carnegie Hall, the LA Civic Auditorium, and on the <emph render="italic">Tonight Show</emph>.  In addition to his musical work, Cassidy was also a prolific screenwriter--he sold film scripts and treatments, and worked in both film development and television production.  His 1996 documentary, <emph render="italic">Civil Rights and Civil Wrongs</emph>, about the Troubles in Northern Ireland, was nominated for an Emmy Award, and his film <emph render="italic">Uncensored Voices</emph> aired on PBS.  </p><p>In the 1990s, Cassidy's interests turned toward research and academia.  Cassidy was a professor at New College of California, in the Media &amp; Film Studies Department, where he taught storytelling, newspaper writing, and broadcast history classes.  In 1995, he founded the Irish Studies Program (An Leann Eireannach) at New College.  Cassidy was co-director of the program, one of the first in the country, until the college closed in 2008.  Additionally, Cassidy was co-founder of the Crossroads Irish American Festival in San Francisco, and served as director of the festival until his death.</p><p>Cassidy was a prolific contributor to newspapers and journals.  His book, <emph render="italic">How the Irish Invented Slang: The Secret Language of the Crossroads</emph>, was published in 2007.  The book, which looked at the influence of Irish phrases on slang that developed in America in the 1800s, won the 2007 American Book Award for nonfiction.  The book was met with much praise from within the Irish-American community, but was criticized by linguists for lacking evidence to support the book's claims.  Cassidy's other research interest was African-American and Irish intermarriage in New York City in the 1800s, although he did not develop this enough before his death to publish any scholarly work on the topic.  Cassidy died on October 11, 2008.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information Note</head>
<p>When this material arrived, there was no discernible order inherent in the way the material was arranged.  There were no folders or other means of organization, and materials related to each other were scatted among the various boxes.  The current organization of the collection was imposed by the archivist.  Once the order was established, materials were all placed in new acid-free folders and boxes.  Folder titles were assigned, as there were no pre-existing folder titles.</p><p>The dates on the folders containing previously published (secondary source) or census material indicate the dates that Cassidy annotated the material, not the date of original publication.  There are a wide range of original publication dates within the secondary source material; the majority of the historical newspaper clippings and plays were originially published between 1880-1920.  Dates in brackets are best approximations of when Cassidy was annotating the material.</p>  </processinfo>

It includes Cassidy's typed notes and draft manuscripts, annotated historical newspaper clippings and play scripts, census documents, and extensive annotated secondary source material, as well as a large collection of notebooks containing Cassidy's own research notes, which deal with both of these research interests as well as his New College classes.  Although there is some overlap between Cassidy's two areas of focus, the majority of his annotations on the secondary source material, newspapers, and plays have to do with his research on the Irish language and American slang.  Cassidy's annotations on on the census documents focus on African-American/Irish intermarriage.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">How the Irish

mostly contains awards, correspondence and newspaper clippings relating to Cassidy's life and work, as well as his research into his personal family history.  The correspondence that was provided with the collection is very sporadic, and consists of emails written and printed out by Cassidy, and notes from friends and colleagues regarding his illness.  The newspaper clippings differ from those in Series I, as these are clippings about, not authored by, Cassidy.  The most significant portion of material in this series relates to Cassidy's work on tracing his own family's genealogy.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref74" level="file"><did><unittitle>Personal Email/Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">2004-2008</unitdate><container id="aspace_39e868282e2dc0153ab95ecc3cad9c7e" label="Mixed Materials [31142054615102]" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_39e868282e2dc0153ab95ecc3cad9c7e" type="Folder">14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref75" level="file"><did><unittitle>Family Genealogy</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1871-2008</unitdate><container id="aspace_af9c0a4987c16a8d45768ea9b6226f7f" label="Mixed Materials [31142054615102]" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_af9c0a4987c16a8d45768ea9b6226f7f" type="Folder">15</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref76" level="file"><did><unittitle>Awards/Certificates </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">2000-2008</unitdate><container id="aspace_3aea553307cd464fb43dd388518bebee" label="Mixed Materials [31142054615102]" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_3aea553307cd464fb43dd388518bebee" type="Folder">16</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref77" level="file"><did><unittitle>New College of California/Crossroads Irish-American Festival</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">2000-2007</unitdate><container id="aspace_ade55f1d3fc01625bcbf0ce338662e3b" label="Mixed Materials [31142054615102]" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_ade55f1d3fc01625bcbf0ce338662e3b" type="Folder">17</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref78" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings About Cassidy</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1998-2007</unitdate><container id="aspace_50e6e8cb33b231a19dce1087bd53bbf0" label="Mixed Materials [31142054615102]" type="Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_50e6e8cb33b231a19dce1087bd53bbf0" type="Folder">18</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref79" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series III: Film</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1987-1997</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b68b2cbe6a07996e36232daac52a4b8e"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>Series III: Film includes Cassidy's scripts, screenplays, and film treatments.
