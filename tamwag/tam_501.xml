    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>John Penley is a photographer and grassroots political activist associated with the squatters' rights movement and housing protests of the 1980s and 1990s in New York City's East Village and Lower East Side, as well as numerous other social causes. A former Navy serviceman, Penley took up photography as part of an effort to document the demonstrations, protests, and other political actions in which he took part, and in the process became a photojournalist. Hundreds of Penley's photographs have appeared in in publications including the <emph render="italic">New York Daily News</emph>, the <emph render="italic">New York Post</emph>, the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, <emph render="italic">New York and Long Island Newsday</emph>, <emph render="italic">New York Magazine</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Villager</emph>, <emph render="italic">High Times Magazine</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Guardian</emph>, <emph render="italic">Art In America</emph>, <emph render="italic">WW 3 Illustrated</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Shadow</emph>, the <emph render="italic">East Village Eye</emph>, and many small political publications. They have also been distributed through press services such as United Press International and the Associated Press.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information note</head>
<p>In 2009, a group of color slides from which images were selected to be displayed in the Tamiment Library's flickr exhibit of John Penley's images were rehoused into paper sleeves or envelopes and placed in three record cartons.  John Penley wrote descriptions of the events or subjects on the majority of the sleeves.  Most of the sleeves in this group are un-numbered except for those shoots from which images drawn for the flickr exhibit. Those shoots have numbers written on their sleeves and these same shoot numbers are displayed with the captions for the images from them in the flickr exhibit.  Researchers should note that additional images from the same shoots and events found in the flickr exhibit may also be found in shoots with similar captions and dates throughout the rest of the collection.</p><p>In 2013, the remaining photographic materials in the collection were removed from their original housing and rehoused in archival quality boxes, folders, and sleeves. John Penley provided description for much of the collection during this rehousing, and his descriptions, which often include  subjective and evaluative information, constitute the folder-level titles in Series II of the collection. However, researchers should note that not all of the collection was described during this process.</p><p>Photographs and negatives from discrete events or subjects were originally housed together in their own envelopes or other containers in several record cartons. The archivists assigned each envelope or other container a sequential three-digit number, followed by either the suffix "-P" for prints or suffix "-N" for negatives. For example, negatives from an original envelope might be assigned the number "001-N" and any prints from that same envelope would be assigned the number "001-P." Standard-size photographs were rehoused in photograph boxes and were separated by tabs with the identifying number and suffix written on them. Oversize photographs were rehoused in archival folders and placed in record cartons, with the identifying number and suffix written on the folders. Negatives were rehoused in paper sleeves and placed in negative boxes, with the identifying number and suffix written on the sleeves.</p><p>When only prints or only negatives were housed within their own envelope or other container, the materials were assigned their own number and suffix, without a corresponding number for the other photographic format. For example, if any envelope contained only negatives and no prints, the negatives might be assigned the number "002-N," but "002-P" would not exist, which explains why there are gaps in the numbering within the record cartons and photograph and negative boxes.</p><p>Photographs and negatives which were loose in the original record cartons (not housed in their own envelopes or other containers) were assigned their own number using the same numbering system, but also include the following in brackets: "[Loose from box X]" (with "box X" indicating the original record carton number).</p><p>Any descriptive information written on the original envelopes or containers was retained. The archivists either wrote this information on the dividing tabs, folders, or sleeves or photocopied or cut out the information from the original envelope and placed the clipping within the folders or in front of the dividing tab or sleeve.</p><p>Slides have been removed from their original containers and rehoused in archival quality slide boxes. Slides have been numbered using the same alphanumeric numbering system as the prints and negatives (001-S, 002-S, etc.) and tabs have been used within each slide box to indicate the original groupings of the slides. The numbering for the slides is separate from the numbering for the other photographic materials; that is, the numbers from the slides' alphanumeric codes do not correlate to the numbering used for the prints and negatives (the slides that comprise 001-S are not from the same shoot as 001-N and 001-P).</p><p>John Penley's papers and photographs were initially established as separate collections: the John Penley Photographs (PHOTOS 268) and the John Penley Papers (TAM 501). In 2013, the photograph collection was incorporated into the paper collection, forming the John Penley Photographs and Papers (TAM 501).</p><p>In 2014, the archived website was added as Series III.</p>  </processinfo>

However, the photographic materials in the collection (mainly prints and negatives, though there are also slides, contact sheets, and images on CD) date from the 1980s to 2013 and also showcase a variety of other social issues and feature New York City as a whole, as well as other national and international locales. </p><p>Penley's photographs provide documentation of protests by homeless and squatters' rights activists, as well as gay rights and AIDS activists (including the organization ACT UP) and demonstrations against police brutality, the death penalty, and racial hate crimes and discrimination. Many protests Penley documented take place at political conventions and/or are against specific politicians. There are also images of medical marijuana rallies, cultural celebrations, and New York City landmarks and nightlife. Well-known individuals featured in the collection include Rudy Guiliani, Ed Koch, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Arlo Guthrie, Matt Dillon, Martin Sheen, Philip Berrigan, Timothy Leary, and Ramsey Clark, as well as Lower East Side artist and writer residents such as Allen Ginsburg, William Burroughs, Keith Haring, and Karen Finley. </p><p>Penley documented his travels to Mexico and Nicaragua (the latter during the conflict between the Sandinista government and the "contras") during the 1980s. Two CDs contain photographs from Penley's March 2013 protest in front of New York University's Bobst Library, in which Penley attempted to persuade NYU to provide housing for the East Village's homeless and low-income residents. The series also includes three unlabeled mini-DV cassette tapes.</p><p>Researchers should note that additional images from the same shoots and events found in the in the Tamiment Library's 2009 flickr exhibit of John Penley's images may also be found in shoots with similar captions and dates throughout the rest of the series.</p><p>Researchers should also note that not all of the series is described. Some entire boxes of negatives or photographs are undescribed (which is noted in the container list), and occasionally a few individual shoots or events in a box are undescribed, even if the majority of the box has been described. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref457" level="file"><did><unittitle>Negatives From Which Images Were Selected for Tamiment Library's 2009 Flickr Exhibit</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1990/2000" type="inclusive">circa 1990-2000</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_fd25ffec4dda65445f87dcf8f2d77976" label="Mixed Materials [31142062728897]" type="Box">3</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_226e7f9780e746c60bde54b5f8a02d27" label="Mixed Materials [31142063293826]" type="Box">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref458" level="file"><did><unittitle>Negatives From Which Images Were Selected for Tamiment Library's 2009 Flickr Exhibit and Slides 001-S to 049-S (includes slides housed with 623-N and 664-P)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1990/2000" type="inclusive">circa 1990-2000</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_6987cae2c0130394c05390330faa8190" label="Mixed Materials [31142062728913]" type="Box">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref15" level="file"><did><unittitle>NY Tattoo Convention, Roseland Ballroom, Paul Booth World Famous Tattoo Artist</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1993</unitdate><container altrender="Card Box 5.75" id="aspace_581d91b33f27323eec60499b3970afb9" label="Mixed Materials [31142062729036]" type="Box">13</container><container parent="aspace_581d91b33f27323eec60499b3970afb9" type="Folder">001-N</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref16" level="file"><did><unittitle>NY Tattoo Convention, Roseland Ballroom, Paul Booth World Famous Tattoo Artist</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1993</unitdate><container altrender="Hollinger Card Box -
