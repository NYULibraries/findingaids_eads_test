    <abstract id="aspace_6829891adf1f806ec3bfbe6b2059dedf">The Vagabond Puppeteers were a traveling puppet theater who were inspired by leftists campaigns in rural Mexico to educate the people of Mexico in the post-revolutionary era. Members included Harriet Holtzman, Mary Walton Jimenez, Jerry Oberwager, and Pete Seeger. The troupe toured New York State in the summer of 1939, with the goal of supporting the labor organizing of the Dairy Farmers Union, who at the time were on strike and agitating for higher prices. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Mona Jimenez and Gina Murtagh planned, researched, and recorded footage for an unfinished documentary about the Vagabond Puppeteers. The Mona Jimenez and Gina Murtagh Papers from a Documentary about the Vagabond Puppeteers (dated 1989-1997) consists of materials created and collected by Jimenez and Murtagh while researching and creating an unfinished documentary about the Vagabond Puppeteers. Materials include research and planning documents, including correspondence, release forms, research files, and tape logs. The majority of the collection consists of video recordings on Hi8 and U-Matic videocassette. The recordings include interviews with the four members of the Vagabond Puppeteers, Holtzman; Jimenez; Oberwager; and Seeger, during which they describe their experiences in the performance troupe as well as the political environment they were engaged with. Other recordings document a reunion of the Puppeteers at Oberwager's home in 1991. The collection also includes recordings of Jimenez and Murtagh's efforts to locate people active with the Dairy Farmers Union, dairy farming in the 1930s, farming in the 1980s and early 1990s more generally, or who may have recalled attending a Puppeteers performance during the summer tour of 1939. The collection documents not only the Vagabond Puppeteers and their approach to political art in the 1930s, but also the connections between labor organizing and radical art.</abstract>

<p>The Vagabond Puppeteers were a traveling puppet theater who were inspired by leftists campaigns in rural Mexico to educate the people of Mexico in the post-revolutionary era. Members included Harriet Holtzman, Mary Walton Jimenez, Jerry Oberwager, and Pete Seeger. The troupe toured New York State in the summer of 1939, with the goal of supporting the labor organizing of the Dairy Farmers Union, who at the time were on strike and agitating for higher prices. The Vagabond Puppeteers and their brand of political theater had influences on more contemporary activist theater like Bread and Roses and Theatre of the Oppressed.</p>  </bioghist>
