    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>NYU Researchers United-UAW was formed to represent research assistants at the Tandon School of Engineering and research assistants in the Biology, Chemistry, Neural Science, Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Psychology departments. It includes postdoctoral associates and fellows, staff scientists and researchers, and student employees providing research services who are not already represented by the Graduate Student Organizing Committee-UAW (GSOC-UAW). Organizing this unit began in 2020 and started partnering with UAW in 2022. In November 2023, the union filed for recognition with the National Labor Relations Board.</p>  </bioghist>
