<p>In 2016, issues of major national news publications containing general coverage of the 9/11 attacks, which were deemed to contain minimal research value, were removed from this collection. Duplicate copies of clippings, programs, and brochures were also removed. In 2019, a curatorial decision was made during accession to not retain 6 VHS tapes and a printed booklet as they were determined to be out of scope.</p>  </appraisal>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Brenda Berkman is a pioneering female firefighter who worked for the FDNY from 1982 to 2006. She is a founding member and former president of the United Women Firefighters (1982-1986) and served as trustee of the Women in Fire Service (1983-1992). Berkman was born in 1951 and became interested in firefighting as a young girl. She joined the FDNY in 1982 after successfully winning a lawsuit that challenged the department's physical exam, arguing that the tougher requirement discriminated against women and were unnecessary for the job. Berkman was among 47 other women who joined the fire department after passing a revised physical exam. Berkman was promoted to the position of lieutenant in 1994, and captain in 2002. She retired from firefighting in 2006 and shifted to a career in the arts. Most of her work is in stone lithography and copperplate etching which has primarily been inspired by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Decisions regarding arrangement, description, and physical interventions for this collection prior to 2016 have not been recorded. A file list was created in 2016. At this time, folder titles were revised for clarity and consistency and files were arranged in alphabetical order. </p><p>In August 2017, one item was retroactively accessioned into the collection.  This item was prepared to be moved to offsite art storage in September 2017.</p><p>Born-digital materials have not been imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content.</p><p>At the time of accessioning in 2019, materials were placed in new acid-free boxes. All materials were organized in the order the content was received. At this time three VHS cassettes and one audiocassette with evidence of mold or other damage were identified and physically separated from the remainder of the accretion. In 2022 these materials, housed in Box 20, were removed from quarantine and isolated from other items by housing them in a polyethylene bag with a desiccated board and RH monitor strip. If this strip indicates an RH greater than 50%, contact the Preservation Department immediately. Do not open this packaging without contacting the Preservation Department.</p><p>At the time of accessioning in 2023, materials were rehoused in archival boxes and folders and added to the collection's inventory.</p>  </processinfo>
