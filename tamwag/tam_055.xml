    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>John Nicholas Beffel (1887 1973) Radical journalist, publicist, and editor. A prolific writer of articles, essays, and publicity dealing with leftist issues, many pertaining to the syndicalist labor organization the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), anarchism and several noted anarchists. Beffel also produced short stories, autobiographical sketches and poems. Much of his activity involved defense committees for accused radicals in such cases as: the Mooney Billings Case in which the two men were found guilty of a fatal bombing during a Preparedness Day parade in San Francisco in 1916; the Centralia, Washington, case in which ten IWW's were accused of murder during an assault of IWW headquarters in connection with an Armistice Day parade in 1919; Sacco and Vanzetti; the Kentucky Miners Defense, stemming from the bloody "Battle of Evarts" in Harlan County, 1931; the case of Athos Terzani, an anti fascist accused of accidentally murdering a comrade during a fascist rally in New York in 1933; and the un¬solved political murder of anti fascist leader Carlo Tresca in 1943. Beffel was also involved with The League for Mutual Aid, a social service agency for leftists in need of assistance, founded by Roger Baldwin in 1920. Much of the boxes of correspondence relates to Beffel's organizational and publicity efforts in these causes; much of the rest concerns his writings or those of his correspondents. Beffel edited several (published and unpblished) manuscripts, primarily by or about various anarchists (including Mikhail Bakunin, Rose Pesotta, and Harry Kelley, co-founder of the Ferrer colony in Stelton, N.J.), was interested in, and wrote about mysterious disappearances, and sometimes wrote articles under the names of Lancey Fitzgibbons, George Moresby, Mary Starland, Daniel Tower and others.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The papers contain correspondence, subject fifles, writings (by Beffel and others), Family files (unprocessed), an Index to Series I, Correspondence, and an unprocessed Addendum. Correspondents include Richard Brazier, Ralph Chaplin, Daniel Eisenberg, Aldino Felicani, Covington Hall, Harvey O'Connor, Rose Pesotta, Anna Roy, Vincent Starrett, Fred Thompson, Wilma Haywood Veleker, Albert Wehde, Art Young, and numerous family members. Note that correspondence is also found throughout the subject files. Series II, Subject Files, chiefly relate to Beffel's organizational and publicity efforts in the defense of accused radicals in the Mooney-Billings case, Centralia, Wash.; a case involving members of the Industrial Workers of the World (WW); the Sacco-Vanzetti case; the Kentucky miners' defense in Harlan County (1931); the case of Athos Terzani; and Beffel's involvement with the League for Mutual Aid, a social service agency for leftists.
