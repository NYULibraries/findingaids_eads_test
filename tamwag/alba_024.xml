This collection chiefly documents Bessie's activities and writings related to the Spanish Civil War, and his affiliation with the Veterans with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB). Included are the hand-written journals kept by Bessie during his 11 months of service in Spain from January through December 1938, military documents, a working draft of his memoir <title render="italic">Men in Battle</title>, and the typescript of <title render="italic">Spain Again</title>. This collection also contains subject files pertaining to the Bay Area Chapter VALB, and materials related to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade anthology Bessie was engaged in editing at the time of his death.</abstract>

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Alvah Bessie was born in New York City on June 4, 1904 to Daniel Nathan Cohen Bessie, a successful businessman and inventor, and Adeline Schlesinger. The younger of two boys, Bessie was raised in ease in the then-prosperous precincts of Harlem. He attended public school, graduated from Dewitt Clinton High School and, in 1920, enrolled in Columbia University. Bessie's rebellious nature often placed him at odds with his father's conservative values and authoritarian manner. When, in 1922, Daniel Bessie died after suffering a severe economic setback, he left his family in a precarious financial state, but Alvah Bessie free to pursue his own ambitions. Bessie completed his degree and graduated from Columbia in 1924 with a B.A. in English. Through a friend, he found work as an actor with Eugene O'Neill's Provincetown Players. For the next four years Bessie immersed himself in the New York theater scene, performing with the Provincetown Players, the Theatre Guild and with actor-manager Walter Hampden's repertory company in a production of <title render="italic">Cyrano de Bergerac</title>. Recognizing his limited talent as an actor, he left the theater and, in 1928, traveled to France to join the community of American expatriates in Paris intent on becoming a writer.</p><p>During his brief stay in France, he worked as a rewrite man at the <title render="italic">Paris-Times</title>, and wrote "Redbird," his first short story to receive publication. He returned to New York in 1929, and for the next six years, his stories, essays, and reviews appeared in <title render="italic">The</title><title render="italic">New Republic</title>, <title render="italic">Scribner's</title>, <title render="italic">Atlantic Monthly</title>, <title render="italic">Saturday Review of Literature</title>, <title render="italic">Collier's</title>and <title render="italic">Story</title>. In July 1930, he married Mary Burnett, a puppet-maker and artist. The couple moved to Vermont and had two boys -- Daniel and David. Bessie began work on his first novel, <title render="italic">Dwell in the Wilderness</title>. During this time, Bessie also began to study Marxist theory and question his political convictions. Bessie was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship following the publication of his novel in 1935, and, with his family, returned to New York. Back in the City, Bessie began to move in more radical circles, and in 1936 he became a member of the Communist Party. In 1935 he joined the staff of the <title render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</title>, serving as drama and book editor. His tenure at the paper was marked by dissent. His radical stance on striking maritime workers in 1936 and on the Spanish Civil War ran counter to management's more conservative views. A final dispute with the paper stemmed from his praise of French novelist and aviator Andre Malraux's efforts to organize a squadron of French flyers to aid the Spanish Republic. In 1937 he resigned from the <title render="italic">Eagle</title>and went to work in the public relations office of the Spanish Information Bureau, a New York agency of the Republican Government. During this period, the Bessies' marriage began to founder. The couple separated and soon after divorced.</p><p>On January 22, 1938, Bessie sailed to Spain on the <title render="italic">S.S. Lafayette</title>to join the International Brigade's fight against the Franco-led rebellion. Although he earned his pilot's license before leaving for Spain with the objective of serving as a flyer, he was assigned to a front-line combat unit with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, participating in the Ebro offensive from July to September 1938, and attaining the rank of sergeant-adjutant. He also served as a correspondent for the International Brigade's publication <title render="italic">The Volunteer for Liberty</title>. He daily chronicled his personal experiences in a series of notebooks, and upon his return to the United States, these jottings became the basis of his wartime memoirs, <title render="italic">Men in Battle</title>(1939). From 1939 to 1943, Bessie was film and theatre critic for the <title render="italic">New Masses</title>, and, under a pseudonym, wrote a regular column for a Young Communist League publication. He remained active in the Spanish Republican cause, working on behalf of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee writing articles and delivering speeches.</p><p>In 1943 he moved to California and started writing screenplays when Warner Brothers studios hired him as a contract writer. During World War II, he served as Second Lieutenant in the Civil Air Patrol, Los Angeles Squadron 3. In 1945 his original story that was the basis for the screenplay of "Objective Burma" was nominated for an Academy Award. His other screen credits from this time include, "Hotel Berlin," "The Very Thought of You," "Northern Pursuit, " and "Smart Woman." He was fired from Warner Brothers in 1945 in the wake of his outspoken support of striking studio workers. In September 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) launched an investigation on the influence of the Communist Party in the motion-picture industry. Over fifty people were called to testify and answer questions regarding political affiliations and associations. Bessie, along with nine other Hollywood figures, refused to comply with the Committee's demands. They were cited for contempt of Congress, given one-year prison sentences, and became known as the "Hollywood Ten." Bessie served out his term in a federal correctional facility in Texarkana, Texas and was blacklisted in Hollywood.</p><p>After his release from prison, Bessie was not able to get work in the film industry or elsewhere in Los Angeles, so he relocated to San Francisco and found employment with the International Longshoremen's and Warehouseman's Union as assistant editor of the union's newspaper, <title render="italic">The Dispatcher</title>. In 1951 he edited, <title render="italic">The Heart of Spain</title>, an anthology of writings on the Spanish Civil War published and distributed by the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He worked as stage manager and lighting technician for the hungry i nightclub (1956-1963), an experience that inspired the novel, <title render="italic">One for My Baby</title>(1980), and as a cultural critic on the <emph render="italic">People's Daily World</emph> (1957-1960), sometimes using a pseudonym. In the mid-1960s, he worked briefly as a publicist for several San Francisco arts organizations, including the San Francisco Mime Troupe and the San Francisco Film Festival. </p><p>Alvah Bessie married Sylviane Martin in 1963. (Martin was his third wife; his second marriage, to Helen Clare Nelson, ended in divorce). In 1968, Bessie collaborated on the Spanish film, <title render="italic">Espana otra vez</title>, and offered an account of the production and his return to Spain in his memoir <title render="italic">Spain Again</title>. He remained active in the Bay Area Chapter of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, and was honored, in 1975, at their 39th Anniversary Dinner. Before he could complete work on <title render="italic">Our Fight</title>, a VALB anthology devoted to the writings of Lincoln Brigade veterans, Bessie died of a heart attack on July 21, 1985, at the age of 81.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Series I: Spanish Civil War:</emph> </p><p><emph render="bold">Subseries A.: Documents, Undated; 1938.</emph> </p><p>This series contains documents related to Bessie's activities during the Spanish Civil War. Notable are the four hand-written journals in which Bessie kept a record of his 11 months of service in Spain from January through December 1938. A typed transcription of these journals is available here as well. (These journals were published posthumously by his son Dan Bessie in 2001). In addition to a range of military documents, and Bessie's repatriation papers, this series includes propaganda leaflets distributed by the Fascist forces (in Spanish with annotated English translations) that were intended to demoralize the Republican troops.</p><p><emph render="bold">Series I: Spanish Civil War:</emph> </p><p><emph render="bold">Subseries B. Artifacts, Undated; 1938; 1976.</emph> </p><p>The artifacts in the series are mementos from Spain and commemorative objects that Bessie acquired following the war. Of particular interest are the corporal's stripes and International Brigade insignia from Bessie's uniform.</p><p><emph render="bold">Series II: Writings, 1939; 1946-1984.</emph> </p><p>This series includes a working draft of <title render="italic">Men in Battle</title>, and typescript of <title render="italic">Spain Again</title>. Notable is Bessie's 1972 treatment of "The Volunteers," a screenplay based on the life and death of James Lardner, a volunteer who was killed in action during the final days of foreign participation in the Spanish Civil War. Bessie, Lincoln Brigade veteran Arthur Landis, and Bessie's son Dan, later reworked the script, renamed it "The Volunteer," and unsuccessfully sought to have the project produced. Correspondence between the three collaborators and revisions related to this project are located in this series. Also included are the texts of three speeches delivered by Bessie in the 1940s on the plight of Spanish refugees.</p><p><emph render="bold">Series III: Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Anthology, Undated; 1937-1939; 1967-1985.</emph> </p><p>This series includes materials related to the VALB anthology that Bessie was engaged in editing at the time of his death. Originally titled "The Good Fight," the anthology was published after Bessie's death as <title render="italic">Our Fight</title>under the editorship of Albert Prago. The anthology, which was intended as a fiftieth anniversary publication, was chiefly devoted to veterans' accounts of their experiences during and after the war. The bulk of this series is made up of submissions from veterans for this project. Many of these writings are photocopies or transcriptions of previously published works. However, some notable exceptions include a transcription of David Gordon's diary written in 1939 following his release from a Fascist prisoner of war camp; an excerpted memoir by Arthur Timpson; and three essays written by Ben Iceland shortly after his return from Spain. Some of these submissions include correspondence. This series also includes a prospectus for the anthology and general correspondence and notes related to this project.</p><p><emph render="bold">Series IV: Subject Files, 1936-1985.</emph> </p><p>This series includes materials related to Bessie's activities the Bay Area Chapter of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Spanish Civil War anniversaries and symposia, and correspondence with veterans, much of which relates to the VALB anthology. A letter from Steven Nelson offers an account of escorting Lillian Hellman and Dorothy Parker through Valencia in the fall of 1937. Some notable materials in this series include a copy of a letter from Ernest Hemingway to Milton Wolff related to their falling out over <title render="italic">For Whom the Bell Tolls</title>; inscribed reprints from Robert Rosenstone; promotional material and correspondence generated by Bessie related to screenings of the documentary "To Die in Madrid"; and correspondence, clippings and speeches from the 1975 VALB tribute to Bessie. The series also contains Bessie's membership cards from VALB, the American Newspaper Guild, and the Screenwriters Guild.</p>  </scopecontent>
