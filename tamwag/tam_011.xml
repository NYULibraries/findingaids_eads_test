It was able to attract many of the traditional Socialist Party sources of support and its activities were directed by many prominent Socialist Party members, including August Claessens, Algernon Lee, Leo Meltzer, James Oneal and Louis Waldman. The SDF sought to promote the principles of social democracy and independent political action. In the late 1930's, SDF was associated with the American Labor Party of New York and the People's Party. During the 1940's and early 1950's, SDF's membership and influence declined forcing merger negotiations with the Socialist Party. The merger was affected in 1957.

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Social Democratic Federation of America (SDF) was organized in 1936 after the split in the Socialist Party ranks between the Old Guard and the Militants. Although not an official political party like the Socialist Party, the SDF was a political organization which consisted of the following groups: (1) Socialist Party state branches, particularly those in New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Maryland; (2) Socialist Party municipal locals, particularly those in Reading, Pennsylvania, under the leadership of James H. Maurer, and Bridgeport, Connecticut, under the leadership of Mayor Jasper McLevy; (3) labor parties, especially members of the American Labor Party of New York, the FarmerLabor Party of Minnesota, and the Non Partisan League; and (4) socialist foreign language organizations, like the Jewish Socialist Verband and the Finnish Socialist Federation. During its formative period, the SDF was not only able to attract many of the traditional Socialist Party sources of financial support, but its activities were also directed by many prominent members of the Socialist Party, including August Claessens, Algernon Lee, Leo Meltzer, James Oneal, and Louis Waldman.</p><p>During its 20 year history, the SDF sought to promote the principles of social democracy and independent political action. Such ideals were realized through a variety of activities concerning domestic and international issues. Regarding the domestic issues, the SDF sought legislation to amend the National Labor Relations Act, supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in his Presidential campaigns in 1940 and 1944, called upon all labor organizations to unite against communist groups in the United States, and endorsed civil rights legislation. Internationally, the SDF played a vital role in various programs that brought German refugee children to the United States. The SDF also supported American participation in World War II, opposed Mahatma Gandhi's independence movement in India during the war, and assisted in the relocation of Jewish refugees after the war.</p><p>Like the Socialist Party, the SDF was also plagued by bitter internal conflicts. One of the major controversies affecting the organization in the late 1930s and early 1940s was its relationship with the American Labor Party of New York. When the New York Old Guard became the New York State division of the SDF in 1936, they adopted the name "People's Party" and subsequently joined the American Labor Party. From the perspective of the People's Party, this linkage with the American Labor Party was seen as an opportunity to help organize a formidable labor party, support Franklin D. Roosevelt in his Presidential reelection bid, and still remain outside the realm of conventional party politics. Ironically, however, the members of the People's Party, who had earlier withdrawn from the Socialist Party on the grounds that it was overly sympathetic towards communism, were now closely associated with an organization which was controlled by communists. The unsettling relationship with the American Labor Party ultimately caused such influential SDF figures as Louis Waldman and Leo Meltzer to resign from the organization.</p><p>Another conflict within the SDF involved the <emph render="italic">New Leader</emph> and its editor, James Oneal. Shortly after the SDF was established in the fall of 1936, the editorial board of the <emph render="italic">New Leader</emph> withdrew its support for the Socialist Party and joined the new organization. The relationship between the <emph render="italic">New Leader</emph> staff and the SDF executive committee was never cordial, since both groups held differing opinions as to what the editorial policy of the newspaper should be. These disagreements became so large in scope and so emotional in tone that James Oneal finally resigned as editor in 1940. In his resignation letter, Oneal stated that the <emph render="italic">New Leader</emph> had become a liberal, progressive publication instead of a significant SDF organ and that the <emph render="italic">New Leader</emph> had failed to strengthen the SDF overall. Following Oneal's resignation, the editorial board of the <emph render="italic">New Leader</emph> and the SDF leadership continued to fight over the proper editorial policy for the publication. Eventually, the staff of the <emph render="italic">New Leader</emph> split from the SDF.</p><p>During the 1940s and early 1950s, the SDF experienced a drastic decline in its membership and influence. Much of this decline can be attributed to three major factors: (1) the general decline in the popularity of socialism throughout this period; (2) the movement of many socialists, social democrats, and progressive liberals into the Americans for Democratic Action and other liberal organizations; and (3) the suspicions generated by the SDF's association with the American Labor Party. By the early 1950s, this decline forced the SDF leadership to begin serious negotiations with the Socialist Party on a possible merger. Attempts at uniting these two organizations began as early as 1937 and continued through the 1940s without much success. At this point in time, however, the mutual decline of both organizations had prompted a reassessment of the merger issue. Finally, in 1957, after several years of negotiations, the SDF merged with the Socialist Party.</p>  </bioghist>

The items within each of these five files are arranged in chronological order. The bulk of the national correspondence (X:l, X:2) pertains to such routine SDF matters as scheduling meetings and special events, receiving dues, resolving membership problems, handling literature requests, and organizing fund raising campaigns. Besides these routine items, the correspondence also contains information on the Socialist Party split in 1936, the controversial alliance between the SDF and the American Labor Party, the numerous attempts to unite the Socialist Party with the SDF, the recruitment of SDF members and the defection of Socialist Party locals to the SDF, the repudiation of the "Popular Front" issue, the SDF's strong support for American participation in World War II, the SDF's attitude towards the 1940 and 1944 Presidential campaigns, the SDF's support for full employment and fair employment practices, the decline of the SDF in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and the steps taken towards the 1957 merger of the SDF and the Socialist Party. Most of the correspondence is from August Claessens, but there are numerous letters from Leo Meltzer, Algernon Lee, William Karlin, Sarah Limbach, Louis Waldman, Tom Mooney, Lena Morrow Lewis, Sonia Teitelman, Jasper McLevy, Roger Baldwin, Darlington Hoopes, Esther Friedman, James Oneal, George H. Goebel, and Norman Thomas. The SDF convention files (X:3 X:5) include press releases, organizational papers, correspondence, minutes, resolutions, and the SDF constitution and bylaws.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref14" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1937/1937" type="inclusive">1937</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

There is also a file on the armed forces which is located between the state and international files (X:49). The largest files in this part of the collection pertain to state branches in California (X:8), Florida (X:13), Illinois (X:15), Massachusetts (X:25), and the District of Columbia (X:46). Most of the other state branches as well as the foreign countries have relatively small files. The state branch files are arranged in alphabetical order according to the name of the state. The international files are also arranged in alphabetical order and are located after the state branch files. Items within each state branch and international file have been arranged in chronological order, with undated items placed at the end of the file.</p><p>The contents of the state and international files relate primarily to such routine organizational matters as literature requests, membership and dues problems, and meetings. of special interest in these files are the papers of Mayor Jasper McLevy of Bridgeport, Connecticut (X:11). Other interesting items within these files are the Indiana State Executive Committee minutes (X:18) and the Pennsylvania State Executive Committee minutes (X:37).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref56" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alabama</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1942/1946" type="inclusive">May 24, 1942-Oct 11, 1946</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

The files are arranged in alphabetical order according to the name of the committee. Items within each committee file have been arranged in chronological order. One of the most interesting files in this section pertains to the Fred E. Beal case (X:56). In 1938 and 1939, the SDF conducted a vigorous campaign in support of the release of Fred E. Beal who was serving a 17 to 20 year prison term for being convicted of murdering a police chief during the 1929 Gastonia, North Carolina, textile workers strike. It was the SDF's belief that Beal was convicted because of his association with the Communist Party and his labor organizing activities. Another important file in this section pertains to the Spanish Workers Fund (X:65). The SDF organized the Spanish Workers Fund in the mid 1930s for the purpose of offering financial assistance, food, and medical supplies to the supporters of the Loyalists during the Spanish Civil War. Two other prominent files in this section pertain to the National Committee for the Protection and Welfare of Persecuted and oppressed European Victims (X:62) and the Women's Committee of the SDF (X:66).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref190" level="file"><did><unittitle>Beal Committee</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Feb 28, 1938-Jun 9, 1939</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

The bulk of the New York City material is correspondence (X:81). Most of the correspondence pertains to the 1930s and early 1940s, although there are items from the early 1950s. The correspondence relates primarily to such routine organizational matters as establishing new branches and locals; scheduling meetings, rallies, and special conferences; recording dues and other membership information; handling literature requests; and sponsoring bazaars and theater parties. There are items in the correspondence, however, which convey information about the first SDF convention in 1937, financial problems affecting the SDF, the defection of Socialist Party locals to the SDF, SDF's relationship with New York City unions, the Moscow Trials, socialist refugees from Europe who worked with the SDF, the death of B. Charney Vladeck in 1939, the 1940 campaign to attract young people into the SDF, the formation of the Social Democratic Youth in 1941, the decline in SDF membership during the early 1940s, and the SDF Bazaars in the early 1950s. The principal correspondent in this file is August Claessens, but there are also numerous letters from Julius Gerber, George Field, James Oneal, B. Charney Vladeck, Jacob Panken, Louis Waldman, Lena Morrow Lewis, Sonia Teitelman, Leo Meltzer, Mark Starr, Algernon Lee, Sol Levitas, Alfred Baker Lewis, and Adolph Warshow.</p><p>Other major files in this section are the minutes of the New York City Central and Executive Committee (X:83 and X:85, respectively) papers of radio station WEVD (X:88), and various miscellaneous items (X:87). The WEVD correspondence is especially interesting in that it contains information about programming, editorial viewpoints, and the use of air time by the SDF leadership. The miscellaneous file contains city convention reports and resolutions for 1945, 1946, and 1949; minutes of meetings which discuss the American Labor Party and <emph render="italic">New Leader</emph> controversies; Branch Officer and County Executive Committee minutes; and Grievance Committee reports.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref264" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Jan 1936-Jun 1939</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
