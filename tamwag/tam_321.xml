By combining litigation, advocacy, education, and organizing, AALDEF works with Asian American communities across the country to secure human rights for all. The AALDEF focuses on critical issues affecting Asian Americans, including immigrant rights, civic participation and voting rights, economic justice for workers, language access to services, Census policy, affirmative action, youth rights and educational equity, housing and environmental justice, and the elimination of anti-Asian violence, police misconduct, and human trafficking. The Asian American Legal Defense Fund Records principally contains legal case files (many are closed), principally labor law cases, most involving restaurant and garment industry workers, but also including immigration cases. There are also labbor-related arbitration files, and subject files on the Chinatown Labor Fair, and on immigration, labor, and housing.</abstract>

The website was first crawled in September 2007. It contained press releases describing legal battles pertaining to Asian American civil rights, as well as a list of the AALDEF's programs, including 9/11 disaster response, Affirmative Action, anti-Asian bias, anti-trafficking initiative, economic justice, educational equity, equal access to services, immigrants' rights, leadership development, and voting rights. In 2010, the website was temporarily replaced with a page explaining that the website was under construction. In 2011, the website was relaunched with a new design. The update added a blog section written by Emil Guillermo that focuses on current events relating to political, legal, and social justice for Asian Americans. It also added separate sections for publications by the AALDEF and a litigation docket to read about their notable cases. In 2019, the website was once again updated, with the new design highlighting the AALDEF's Economic Justice for Workers, Immigrant Rights, and Voting Rights &amp; Democracy programs. The updated site contained a new section for press releases, which had formerly been published in the News section, while the News section began featuring articles written by external media outlets. The redesign also added a section for events hosted by the organization. In 2020, the website's blog also began featuring a podcast hosted by Guillermo. At the time this was written in the fall of 2021, the AALDEF's programs included anti-trafficking, Census 2020, economic justice for workers, educational equity, housing &amp; environmental justice, immigrant rights, voting rights &amp; democracy, and the #StopAsianHate Project.</p><p>Also includes the YouTube Channel for the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.
