    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Carl Winter (1906-1991) and Helen Winter (1908-2001) were Communist Party USA activists and officials. Beginning in 1936, Carl Winter held leading posts in the CPUSA in Ohio, Minnesota and California. From 1945 until the mid-1960s, he was Chairman and District Organizer, and Helen Winter was Secretary, of the Communist Party of Michigan. During the McCarthy era, their positions in the CPUSA led to their arrests and indictments, and Carl Winter's imprisonment for three and a half years, under the Smith Act for conspiracy to overthrow the government of the U.S. After his release from prison in 1955, and the dismissal of charges against Helen Winter in 1958, they resumed leading roles in the Communist Party of Michigan and were both named to the National Committee of the CPUSA. In 1966, they moved to New York City where Carl Winter was editor-in-chief of <emph render="italic">The Worker</emph>, and co-editor of the <emph render="italic">Daily World</emph>. Helen Winter served as the International Affairs Secretary of the CPUSA, and was a founding member of the U.S. Peace Council. Both were members of the CPUSA's Political Bureau. In 1980, Carl Winter left his editorial post and became Chairperson of the CPUSA's Central Review Commission. That year the Winters returned to Detroit, where Carl Winter was active in developing the Midwest Labor Institute for Social Studies and Helen Winter operated Global Books. </p><p>Carl Winter was arrested on July 20, 1948 and tried and convicted with eleven other national leaders of the CPUSA under the Smith Act in what became known as The United States vs. Dennis. Winter was represented by George Crockett, an African-American attorney, leading member of the National Lawyer's Guild, and future Detroit circuit court judge and United States Congressman from Michigan. Helen Winter was arrested in 1952, and tried and convicted under the Smith Act with five other leading members of the Michigan Communist Party. The trial was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and charges were dismissed in 1957. Throughout her husband's imprisonment and her own trial, Helen Winter helped organize campaigns on behalf of Smith Act defendants through the National Committee to Win Amnesty for the Smith Act Victims, Families of the Smith Act Victims, and the Civil Rights Congress of Michigan.   </p><p>Hortense Allison and Alfred Wagenknecht (1881-1956) were leaders of the Socialist Party of America in Washington State in the early twentieth century. In 1913, the family moved to Cleveland, where Wagenknecht was State Secretary of the Ohio Socialist Party. As a result of his active opposition to World War I, he was arrested and imprisoned in 1917 with Charles Ruthenberg in Canton, Ohio. In 1919, Wagenknecht presided over the founding convention, and was named National Secretary, of the Communist Labor Party of America, one of two organizations that would eventually merge to create the CPUSA. In 1924 Wagenknecht managed the fundraising drive for the <emph render="italic">Daily Worker</emph> and helped lead the 1926 strike of textile workers in Passaic, New Jersey.</p>  </bioghist>

Correspondence consists primarily of letters from the 1920s between Alfred and Hortense. Letters provide details of Alfred Wagenknecht's professional work for the Communist Party USA, the Communist International (Comintern), and the Jimmy Higgins Bookshop in Greenwich Village, managed by Wagenknecht's brother-in-law, Elmer Allison. Includes letters and related photographs from a trip by Wagenknecht to Germany for a conference in 1922 as a delegate of American Friends of Soviet Russia, and to visit his hometown of Goerlitz. Letters from 1926 provide details of Wagenknecht's work as one of the CPUSA's organizers of the Passaic Textile Strike.
 
Many of the travel, documentary and street photographs in this series appear to have been taken by Alfred Wagenknecht himself and include annotations on their backs. These include photographs from a trip to the Philippines, China and Japan in 1924. Several of these photographs were published in the Communist Party's <emph render="italic">Workers Monthly</emph>, including a photograph of Sun Yat Sen. Photographs from his 1922 trip to Europe include a series documenting a demonstration in Berlin the day after the assassination of Walter Rathenau, and several photographs that include Willi Munzenberg, an organizer of Workers International Relief.
 
This series also includes a photo album documenting the Wagenknecht-Allison family between 1919 and 1925, as well as studio portraits and passport pictures of Wagenknecht and others, postcards from travels to Germany and Asia, and negatives.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref704" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>I, Correspondence</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref109" level="file"><did><unittitle>Allison, Hortense [General]</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1924/1926" type="inclusive">1924-1926, 1937</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal - Tall 12.5" id="aspace_c2efac0a48a79331c84f5c98493f70e6" label="Mixed Materials [31142062722163]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_c2efac0a48a79331c84f5c98493f70e6" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref119" level="file"><did><unittitle>Allison, O.P.

writings, notes, and speeches generated and collected between the late-1940s and late-1950s primarily as a result of or related to Carl and Helen Winter's arrests and trials for violating the Smith Act, and Carl Winter's imprisonment. Legal documents include texts of opinions and petitions from Carl Winter's trial, Dennis vs. the United States, in Foley Square, New York, and Helen Winter's trial with five other leading members of Michigan's Communist  Party, Saul Wellman et. al. vs. the United States of America, between 1953-1954. Includes ephemera from groups opposed to the Smith Act prosecutions including the Civil Rights Congress, Families of the Smith Act Victims, National Association to Win Amnesty for the Smith Act Victims, and the CPUSA. </p><p>Also includes Helen Winter's steno books from her trial and typescript of her closing remarks; notebooks kept by Carl Winter in prison; a petition by Benjamin Davis against segregation in the prisons; poems, including "A Letter to Carl"; Carl Winter's speech "12 x 12 Million"; and an apparently unpublished manuscript by Minnesota writer and activist Meridel Le Sueur entitled "Double Jeopardy" on the plight of families of Smith Act defendants. A comprehensive collection of clippings of press coverage from Detroit's tabloid press of Helen Winter's trial comprises a significant part of the series.   </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref499"
