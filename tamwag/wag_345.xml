      <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
      <p>This collection combines serials relating to the labor movement drawn from two discrete groups of material held by the Tamiment Library. The first was a partially inventoried backlog of serials, received by the library through donations, subscriptions, and in archival collections. The second group consisted of around 1,700 serials, newspapers, and magazines, organized by title as an artificial collection, referred to as Periodicals.001 or Boxed Newspapers. This material was combined, inventoried, and arranged and described in subject-based categories in 2017.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>This collection imposes an artificial arrangement on a range of disparate material separated from the order in which it was originally received at Tamiment Library. The material is separated into five series, dividing serials into groups of topically similar material. The first series largely collects serials issued by labor unions, grouping this material into 12 narrower subseries, according to a union's trade or constituency. The remaining series collect concentrations of similar types of material, for example labor newspapers, or material originating from outside the United States. Within each series, material is arranged at the file level, in alphabetical order by publishing organization. Where possible issues of each publication are organized chronologically, grouped by year. Each title is listed alongside its publishing organization and city of origin, where this information is available.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>The material in this collection was assembled from various backlogs of uncataloged material held by the Tamiment Library. This material was inventoried, separated according to its subject matter, and arranged in a series of subject-based artificial collections. Accumulations of similar material relating to the labor movement were identified -- volumes of daily labor newspapers; serials and pamphlets issued by labor research organizations -- informing five series of material, grouping material by genre (Labor News), provenance (International Labor Organizations), or topic (Labow Law; Labor Research). A taxonomy used within the Tamiment Library, delineating affinities between different industries and unions in detail, was used to structure the 12 subseries of Series I. Within each series, serials are arranged alphabetically by publishing organization, with titles generally listed alongside their publishing organization and place of publication.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Labor Movement Serials groups 2,116 titles published between 1891 and 2012 mainly chronicling the labor movement in the 20th century, originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections. </p>
      <p>The majority of the collection consists of incomplete runs of newspapers, newsletters, bulletins, and mailings distributed by unions, national and local chapters of labor organizations, rank and file groups, government agencies, and advocacy groups. The serials document the activities of individual unions and organizations -- meetings, elections, appointments, negotiations -- as well as the fluctuating trajectories of the labor movement more broadly, with discussions on labor law and government policy, relationships and solidarity between affinity groups, and the concerns of particular constituencies of workers. Serials in this collection range from official publications and conference proceedings regularly distributed by large, AFL-CIO-affiliated organizations to pamphlets and printed matter informally circulated by organizers to announce meetings and actions. Among the larger organizations represented in this collection are the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America; the Communication Workers of America; the American Federation of Teachers; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; and Teamsters for a Democratic Union, as well as prominent labor coalitions in New York State like the United Federation of Teachers and the New York City Central Labor Council. Notable titles include <emph>American Postal Worker</emph>; <emph>Labor Chronicle</emph>; <emph>United Labor Action</emph>; <emph>United Teacher</emph>; <emph>Working Teamster</emph>; <emph>The NMU Pilot</emph>; <emph>Solidarity</emph>, issued by the Labor Committee of the New York Students for a Democratic Society; and the Philadelphia Workers' Organizing Committee's <emph>Organizer</emph>. </p>
      <p>The trades and professions represented in this collection form a comprehensive cross-section of organized labor in the 20th century, encompassing bulletins from unions and rank and file groups representing the building trades, communications workers, public employees, transport employee unions, education and entertainment unions, farmworkers and longshoremen, retail and service workers, and coalitions representing demographics working across different sectors, for example the Jewish Labor Committee.</p>
      <p>In addition to the material documenting the activities of unions in America, the collection also includes a series dedicated to labor research and history, and a collection of trade journals and labor newspapers. Around 300 titles originate from outside the United States, with significant quantities of Canadian and European publications, often representing international bodies or research groups discussing labor policy. No complete runs of publications are contained herein, and generally only a handful of issues of each publication are held.</p>

          <p>This series collects 1,723 publications -- serials, journals, magazines, newsletters, newspapers, bulletins, pamphlets -- issued by labor unions and other related organizations. The majority of the series collects weekly or monthly bulletins distributed by local chapters of unions documenting local activities, wider national efforts, and the lives of union members.</p>

          <p>The material in this series is divided into 12 subseries: Subseries I.A: Building Trades; Subseries I.B: Communication Workers; Subseries I.C: Constituency Groups; Subseries I.D: Co-operatives; Subseries I.E: Education Workers; Subseries I.F: Entertainment; Subseries I.G: Farmworkers and Agricultural Unions; Subseries I.H: Maritime Workers; Subseries I.I: Labor Coalitions and Organizations; Subseries I.J: Public Employees; Subseries I.K: Retail and Service Workers; and Subseries I.L: Transportation Workers. These series group together material issued by organizations operating in similar trades -- educators; entertainment workers; public employees -- or, in the case of Series I, Subseries C, group organizations uniting members around identity or common interest. A taxonomy used within Tamiment Library to structure access to its collections, delineating affinities between different industries and unions in detail, was adapted to structure the 12 subseries of Series I.</p>

            <p>This series collects publications issued by construction and building trades unions, mainly through the 20th century. Large organizations of painters, molders, miners, chemical workers, and engineers -- including the American Federation of Technical Engineers, and the United Steelworkers of America -- are represented at both the national and local level. Smaller organizations and rank and file groups are represented by newsletters circulated to raise awareness around topics including health issues among miners (<emph>Miner's Voice</emph>; <emph>Progressive Miner</emph>; <emph>Straight Track</emph>); safety regulations governing the construction industry (variants of the widely distributed <emph>Hard Hat News</emph>; <emph>Rusty Nail</emph>; <emph>Construction Labor News</emph>); and corruption in Local 282 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (published by Fear of Reprisal Ends).</p>

            <p>Uniting telephone workers, mail carriers, typographic and print unions, and chapters of the Newspaper Guild, this series assembles serials issued by communications workers, with the majority of titles dating between 1950-1990. Around 150 newsletters from individual chapters of the Communications Workers of America, mainly dating from the 1980s, document a range of local union activities across the United States. The series also contains bulletins issued by striking workers at Bell, AT&amp;T, and the Bay Guardian.</p>

            <p>This series collects newsletters and serials issued by organizations representing demographic groups working across different industries, including publications issued by Asian-American organizations and staff groups (Asian Americans for Equal Employment; Chinese Staff and Workers Association); African-American workers (the Black Workers Congress; Coalition of Revolutionary Black Workers; Coalition of Black Trade Unionists); religious organizations (The Workmen's Circle; Histradut); and women's groups (Non-Traditional Employment for Women; Women for Economic Justice; Union Women's Alliance to Gain Equality). Featuring many organizations based in New York City, and largely dating from the 1970s to the 1990s, publications often combine local community news with writing around labor activism, detailing the living and working conditions of factory workers, restaurant staff, and sleeping car porters, among others.</p>

            <p>Representing a swell of activity in businesses structured around the co-operative model between 1930-1950, this series collects serials and publications issued by a variety of co-operative organizations -- including farms, factories, markets, distributors, and co-operative leagues -- in the United States. Publications are often instructive, featuring tips on growth or business operation (<emph>ECL Leadership Bulletin</emph>; <emph>Cooperative Builder</emph>), commentating on the co-operative economy and advertising products and supplies.</p>

            <p>This series collects uncataloged serials and newsletters published by a variety of labor coalitions, advocacy groups, research institutions, professional associations, and political organizations. Formed around common interest groups, a full range of labor causes are detailed in bulletins, newspapers, and circulars: the rights of women in the workplace (various publications issued by the Coalition of Labor Union Women and New York Women's Trade Union); benefit and pension updates for workers (<emph>Employee Benefits Digest</emph>; <emph>Labor News for Working Families</emph>; <emph>Westchester 60 Plus</emph>); and activism around unemployment and working conditions (newsletters issued by Jobs With Justice; Rhode Island Workers Association Organizing Center; and the Trade Union League). Issuing organizations range from large coalitions (Jewish Labor Committee; New York City Central Labor Council; Philadelphia Workers' Organizing Committee) to smaller bodies and rank and file groups providing information for workers exposed to asbestos (<emph>Abestos Update</emph>).</p>

            <p>This series collects various uncataloged serials and newsletters mainly issued by large national organizations including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; Civil Service Employees Association; Civil Service Employees Association; District Council 1707 Shop Stewards; New York State Department of Labor; and New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University. Weekly and monthly newsletters document union advocacy at a national scale, providing significant coverage of changes in labor law -- collective bargaining; retiree rights; strike actions -- as well as documenting the day-to-day circumstances of particular unions, for example the election of union representatives, and divisions between organizations and rank and file groups.</p>

The series also contains reports and publications issued by international bodies concerning globalization, environmental regulation, and regionally specific elements of the labor movement, specifically in Vietnam (<emph>Vietnamese Trade Unions</emph>); Japan (<emph>"Problems and Difficulties" of Japanese Workers Today: Towards the Extraction of Needs</emph>); the United Kingdom (<emph>Future of British Agriculture</emph>).</p>
