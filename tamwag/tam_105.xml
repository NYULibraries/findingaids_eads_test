    <abstract id="aspace_fd40b6840fef3b676f064929bf19efeb">The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) was founded in 1982 with the merger of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC, founded in 1973) and the New American Movement (NAM, founded in 1972). DSOC emerged from a split in the Socialist Party; it was led by Michael Harrington (1928-1989), the author of <emph render='italic'>The Other America</emph> (1962), and had strength in the labor movement and portions of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. NAM grew out of the New Left and feminist movements, and was joined by a number of former Communist Party members. The Democratic Socialists of America is the largest socialist organization in the United States, with over 92,000 members, chapters in all 50 states (both statistics as of 2022), and a youth and student section, Young Democratic Socialists of America. The Democratic Socialists of America Records consist of materials created by the organization, its two predecessor organizations,  their leaders, and their members from the DSA's inception to its current state. These materials include publications; national board and committee meeting minutes and agendas; local chapter meeting minutes; conference programs; member correspondence and mailings; reports and proceedings of the Socialist International, of which DSOC was first, and then DSA was the U.S. affiliate until 2017; files on the DSA-founded Institute for Democratic Socialism, which later became the DSA Fund; and files on other labor and left organizations, as well as websites created by the DSA. The collection also contains published and unpublished writings of Michael Harrington.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) was founded in 1982 with the merger of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC, founded in 1973) and the New American Movement (NAM, founded in 1972). DSOC emerged from a split in the Socialist Party, and it was led by Michael Harrington (1928-1989), the author of <emph render='italic'>The Other America</emph> (1962), and had strength in the labor movement and portions of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. NAM grew out of the New Left and feminist movements, and it was joined by a number of former Communist Party members. Harrington and others left the Socialist Party of America  over its support of the Vietnam War. Harrington was one of the principal founders of DSOC. DSOC worked to build a progressive presence in the Democratic Party through its Democratic Agenda project in the late 1970s; collaborated closely with progressive labor unions and leaders, and others to promote a social-democratic agenda and a peaceful foreign policy; and advocated for socialism while strongly criticizing Communism. </p><p>NAM was founded by members of Students for a Democratic Society and other progressive groups of the 1960s. Initially composed largely of anti-Vietnam war activists, NAM also attracted Second Wave feminists. Its members were committed to activism and political education. It initiated a call for a socialist feminist conference in 1975 and it participated in the Reproductive Rights National Network. Other areas of work included plant closings and energy and urban issues.</p><p>Eventually DSA established chapters in virtually every state, including chapters at many colleges and universities. DSA members worked in solidarity campaigns with movements in what is now called the Global South such as in El Salvador and South Africa. DSA organized against neoliberal policies and programs from the Reagan era on, advocating health care for all and opposing financial deregulation. In the 1990s they promoted labor organizing and opposed President Bill Clinton's welfare reforms, expansion of prisons, and free trade policies such as NAFTA. They participated in movements against post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  After the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, they joined Occupy actions. Beginning in the 2010s, they raised funds to promote abortion access by hosting Abortion Bowl-A-Thons. DSA supported Bernie Sanders in his 2016 and 2020 primary campaigns for president and in the intervening period ran a national campaign for Medicare for All. By 2024, the organization had three national priorities, expressed through the National Electoral Commission, the National Labor Commission, and the Green New Deal, and a variety of Working Groups organized around specific issues or constituencies.</p><p>DSA has a section for youth and students, which focuses on student issues, including student debt, and student/labor solidarity. In the 1990s, it changed its name from DSA Youth Section to Young Democratic Socialists (YDS).  In 2017, it changed its name from YDS to Young Democratic Socialists of America. </p><p>DSA publishes <emph render="italic">Democratic Left</emph>, continuing the name of DSOC's outreach publication. Issues of it and issues of NAM's outreach publications <emph render="italic">New American Movement</emph> and <emph render="italic">Moving On</emph>, are available in the collection and in the archived DSA website. In 2024, DSA ceased to publish a print edition of <emph render="italic">Democratic Left</emph> and instead maintained two online outreach publications: <emph render="italic">Democratic Left</emph> and <emph render="italic">Socialist Forum</emph>. DSA was instrumental in the creation of the Socialist Scholars Conference (later known as the Left Forum), and established the Institute for Democratic Socialism (now, the DSA Fund). </p><p>DSA became the largest socialist organization in the United States, with over 92,000 members, chapters in all 50 states (both statistics as of 2022), and a youth and student section. After 2005, it served as the sole U.S. affiliate of Socialist International until 2017, when it left. The organization is committed to the idea that "working people should run both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few." </p><p>Sources Cited:</p><p>Democratic Socialists of America.

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Portions of the collection were processed in January 1985, May 1991, and 2009, by Alizah Zinberg, David Donabedian, and others.</p><p>Photographs were separated from this collection during initial processing and were established as a separate collection, the Democratic Socialists of America [International Union of Socialist Youth World Festival] Photographs (PHOTOS 129). In 2014, the photograph collection was reincorporated into the the Democratic Socialists of America Records.</p><p>In 2014, the archived websites were added as Series XIV. Additional websites were added to Series XIV in 2019-2024. The series was rearranged in 2024.</p><p>Prior to 2017, some materials in the collection were placed in new acid-free folders. Original folder information, when available, was retained. Box 18, formerly box 1, was arranged by an archivist. </p><p>In 2018, one box of position papers and organizational literature was added to the collection as box 21. These materials were not organized by an archivist. The June 2018 Accretion containing position papers from 1972 to 1981 was added to the collection as Box 22. These materials were placed in new acid-free folders and boxes but were not organized by an archivist.</p><p>Materials in the 2019 accretion were rehoused in acid-free boxes. Loose VHS tapes were rehoused in cases and posters were intellectually added. Born-digital materials were identified and physically inventoried, but not forensically imaged. </p><p>In June 2023, a new survey, processing plan, and updated organizational structure were compiled; in addition, the first series and audiovisual materials for all corresponding series were processed and rehoused in acid-free boxes and folders. Two audio reels were stabilized and need no additional treatment at this time; one issue of <emph render='italic'>Socialist Forum</emph> was treated by Preservation in order to unglue its pages. Materials from OH 058 (Democratic Socialists of America Audiocassette Collection), a previously established distinct collection, were incorporated into this collection. 697 floppy disks, 2 zip disks, and 58 CDs and DVDs were forensically imaged.</p><p>In late October 2023, the rest of the collection was processed and rehoused in acid-free boxes and folders. The previously imaged disks, CDs, and DVDs were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. Financial materials (bank statements, receipts, and invoices), duplicate publications and documents, publications available online or in NYU's catalog, documents with sensitive personal information, blank disks, and system disks were removed. Three record cartons of Mobilization for Survival records were deaccessioned. </p><p>In July-August 2024, materials from the Joel Blau Collection of New American Movement Records (TAM 051) were integrated into this collection, both physically and intellectually, as boxes 292-340 in series I-X and XIII. These materials were moved because they were created by the New Amerian Movement and not by Joel Blau.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Democratic Socialists of America Records consist of materials created by the organization, its leaders, and its members from its inception to its current state. These materials reflect the organization's efforts to promote a vision of democratic socialism and to fight for reforms that empower working people through a variety of tactics, including legislative reform and direct action. </p><p>Materials include Michael Harrington's early writing (both published and unpublished), which reflects positions later adopted by DSA; correspondence, memos, publications, resolutions, and mailings from Harrington's term as the chair of the Socialist Party, USA; letters documenting his resignation as chair and subsequent resignation from the party; and meeting minutes and correspondence of the Coalition Caucus, the predecessor of Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC).</p><p>Materials also include publications, correspondence, and meeting minutes from DSOC and the New American Movement (NAM) before they merged; also included are materials documenting the merger. Other materials consist of minutes, agendas, statements, and reports from DSA's governing bodies (National Board, National Executive Committee, and National Political Committee) and those of DSOC and NAM, and minutes, reports, statements, and publications from its various committees, commissions, and caucuses (including the Feminist Commission, Religious Socialism Committee, and the Democratic Agenda, among others). There is a large amount of material from the Youth Section of DSOC, the DSA Youth Section, the Young Democratic Socialists, and the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA); included are convention proceedings, mailings, chapter reports, and executive committee minutes. </p><p>On the national level, there are materials from the office (staff meeting minutes and correspondence); convention programs, papers, and speeches; events and projects (such as Justice for All and Center for Democratic Values, among others); publications (<emph render='italic'>Democratic Left</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Socialist Forum</emph>, <emph render='italic'>New American Movement</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Moving On</emph>, and various position papers); clippings and articles about DSA; membership mailings; and fundraising campaigns and grant applications. On the regional and local level, for NAM, DSOC, and DSA, there are chapter meeting minutes, reports, and local convention programs. Additionally, there are meeting minutes, resolutions, and conference proceedings from Socialist International, and financial records, correspondence, and conference programs from the Institute for Democratic Socialism/DSA Fund. DSA often worked with other organizations and unions with similar interests, like the National Organization for Women and Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union; included are printed matter from these organizations (brochures and newsletters) and conference materials. </p><p>The websites of the national organization, chapter organizations, committees, YDSA, and other offshoots are also included in this collection. This collection also includes audio and video recordings of NAM, DSOC, and DSA convention sessions, lectures, and television appearances by  leaders on analog and electronic formats. Additional born-digital materials contain mailings, printed matter (brochures, flyers, and conference programs), and position papers, mostly from the mid 1990s-2010s.</p><p>Because materials in this collection were received from multiple sources, and NAM (from 1972 to 1982) and DSOC (from 1973 to 1982) both maintained organizational records, files dating prior to the 1982 founding of DSA may originate from either NAM or DSOC. When these files have materials dated after 1982, researchers should presume that DSA continued to use the same filing scheme as the originating office. This is especially prevalant in Series VIII. Chapters.</p>  </scopecontent>

It documents Michael Harrington's early years with the Young People's Socialist League and his later role as chair of the Socialist Party, USA (which changed its name to Socialist Party-Democratic Socialist Federation, USA, or SP-DSF, around April 1972), through his resignation from the party and the formation of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) in 1973. Additionally, materials cover the early negotiations between DSOC and the New American Movement (NAM), their eventual merger, and the formation of the Democratic Socialists of America (1982) through notes, resolutions, meeting minutes, negotiating instructions, and the merger agreement. Materials also include notes and meeting minutes from the Coalition Caucus, the precursor to DSOC; correspondence (most of which is from Michael Harrington and Carl Shier, Regional Director of the United Auto Workers and co-founder of DSOC with Harrington); Socialist Party, USA/SP-DSF mailings, resolutions, publications (such as <emph render='italic'>New America</emph>), press releases, and Harrington's resignation letter; correspondence, memos, a proposed constitution, and the publication <emph render='italic'>Socialist Reporter</emph> (a special report on the founding of DSOC) from the early days of DSOC; and early versions of DSA's constitution and bylaws. Michael Harrington's early published and unpublished writing is included here since it reflects the directions and views eventually adopted by DSOC. Published writing includes <emph render='italic'>American Power in the Twentieth Century</emph> (published by the League for Industrial Democracy, 1967), and various articles for <emph render='italic'>The New York Times</emph> and <emph render='italic'>New York Herald Tribune</emph>, among others. Uunpublished writing includes a speech on youth and the labor movement, delivered at the 22nd Annual Central Labor Union Conference at the University of Illinois (December 1971), and an article draft on Vietnam (August 1971).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_9030ccdfbfab196ce0ff16e0a1d9b293" level="file"><did><unittitle>Notes and Writing on the History of Democratic Socialists of America</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/971324</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1988/1988">1988</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

These materials illustrate how the governing bodies have led, and continue to lead, the implementation of DSA's major goals, both political and organizational. These materials include meeting minutes and agendas, correspondence and memos, reports, and notes from the National Board and the National Executive Committee (NEC). From circa 1978-early 1990s, there was also a National Office Committee (NOC), which focused on financial matters and events, such as the Convention. The minutes, reports, and memos of the NOC also are included here. This series also consists of National Political Committee (NPC) materials, which later took over the role of the board of directors (members are elected every two years by the delegates to DSA's National Convention). Some recordings of meetings, on audio and videocassettes, also are included.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_cc92e440a992a64aec06282568305d6c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) and New American Movement (NAM) -- Constitutions and Amendments</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/990476</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1973/1981" type="inclusive">1973-1981</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Materials include Executive Committee and National Coordinating Committee minutes, memos, mailings, chapter updates, event materials (conference programs, rally and march flyers, and articles/clippings about events), information on internship programs (applications), fundraising and outreach documents (correspondence and mailings, fundraising event invitations, and membership brochures), organizing manuals, resolutions, and mailings from related organizations (including the Student Action Union and Campus Labor Institute). Also included are audiovisual recordings of conferences and other events.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_86571ca0ce25f103fd4c5be27fc57d0a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Section History -- Young

These materials reflect the day-to-day administrative tasks, as well as the national oversight of numerous chapters, performed by the staff members of DSOC, NAM, and DSA. Materials include general financial records (mostly budgets), internal memos, staff meeting minutes, and directors' correspondence and reports. Additionally, there is biographical material, writing (both published and unpublished), and publicity on and by Michael Harrington. Items include correspondence between Harrington and publishers; copies of his CV; drafts, publications, and notes written by Harrington; reviews of his writing; clippings of his appearances; and interviews with him. Writing, publicity, and biographical information on other prominent staff members, including Carl Shier, a founding member of DSOC; Jack Clark, the first national organizer of DSOC; Harry Boyte, a leading figure of NAM; and Barbara Ehrenreich, a co-chair of DSA, are included. There is general correspondence with members about dues and registration; chapter leaders about the number of delegates apportioned to the national convention; other organizations on co-sponsoring events; and individuals about conference and other event participation.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_c6bfc918ea65683e4c01c42e70b82643" level="file"><did><unittitle>Harrington, Michael -- Correspondence</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/990859</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1973" type="inclusive">1972-1973</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

The election of members of the National Political Committee (NPC), the highest decision-making body between conventions, occurs during each Convention.

Materials cover the first conventions of DSOC and NAM through conventions in the 2010s, and include programs, agendas, mailings to speakers, speeches, papers delivered, registration materials, facilities information, press packets, resolutions, and audiovisual recordings of speeches and conference sessions.</p></scopecontent><bibliography id="aspace_3e6684638edc7c4083f62b9712e0ca82"><head>Bibliography</head><p>Arranged chronologically.</p></bibliography><c id="aspace_633791d9bb484409378179396bb75be8" level="file"><did><unittitle>New American Movement (NAM) -- Thanksgiving/Program Conference -- Davenport</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/1004774</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1971/1971">November 1971</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Committee publications, such as <emph render='italic'>Green News</emph>, the Feminist Commission's <emph render='italic'>Not Far Enough</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Labor Voice</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Nuestra Lucha</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Religious Socialism</emph>, and YDSA publications, including <emph render='italic'>The Activist</emph>, are included here. Also included are papers/bulletins on particular issues, (such as the importance of unions, education as a right, and women's health bibliographies), socialist bibliographies, guidelines, and glossaries (for example, "Glossary of Terms for Leftists"). "Incomplete" indicates that there is not a complete run of issues for a particular publication. A few unpublished writings also are included, as working papers. Published writing by Michael Harrington as a representative of DSOC, and later DSA, are included. All of these materials illustrate how DSA has communicated its message to its members and the general public over the years.</p></scopecontent><relatedmaterial

Included are planning materials (correspondence and memos, budgets, and schedules) for various projects and events sponsored by DSA and its predecessor organizations, such as the Speakers' Bureau, Solidarity Day, Justice for All/Poverty Project, anti-draft and anti-Vietnam war activities rallies, University in Society Project, National Campaign for Peace in the Middle East, and political education. Additionally, there is information on work with other organizations and participation in other organizations' events, such as the Full Employment Action Council and the Democratic National Convention. Corresponding publicity (flyers, posters, articles, and clippings) is included with all events and programs. Also included are audiovisual recordings of television appearances by DSA leaders, sessions from other organizations' conferences, and lectures and talks.</p></scopecontent><c

In the mid-1990s, IDS changed its name to the Democratic Socialists of America Fund. Materials consist of conference proposals and programs, correspondence, fundraising materials, and membership records. Materials also include audio recordings of speeches and panels from the "Eurosocialism and America" conference, a three-day conference in 1980, in which U.S. activists met with international leaders of social democratic and democratic socialist political movements to explore how democratic socialist policy alternatives could benefit the U.S. Notable individuals featured in the recordings include world leaders like Willy Brandt (Germany), Olof Palme (Sweden), Joop den Uyl (Netherlands), Francois Mitterand (France), as well as Michael Harrington, union leader William Winpisinger, Representative Ron Dellums, and Gloria Steinem.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_3fd5f97a8c40672b861750fccb8ad6b9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jamaica Study Group Tour and Meeting with Prime Minister Michael

Specific campaign websites were also captured, including Medicare for All, Close the Camps national action (protesting the detention and mistreatment of migrants and refugees, the separation of migrant families, mass deportation, and raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement), Democratic Socialists campaign for Bernie Sanders, Trans Right and Bodily Autonomy campaign, and a Protect Abortion rights campaign that was launched after the United State Supreme Court overruled <emph render="italic">Roe v. Wade</emph> and limited the right to abortion nationwide. In 2024, the DSA launched a website detailing the organization's goals for the 2024 United States election.</p><p>The series also contains online publications created by the DSA, including <emph render="italic">Socialist Forum</emph>, which intends to facilitate debate and discussion among socialist thinkers and DSA members about ongoing political issues and to develop materials that can be incorporated into future political educational materials; Talking Union blog from the DSA Labor network; <emph render="italic">Democratic Left</emph>, their digital magazine (as well as <emph render="italic">New American Movement</emph> and <emph render="italic">Moving On</emph>, published by NAM); and "Why Socialists Should Become Teachers" digital pamphlet.

The working group led the Power for Texas campaign, which was established in response to the Texas power grid failure in February 2021. Other campaigns include the PRO Act (Protect the Right to Organize) campaign, which advocated for the end the "right to work" laws, legalized secondary strikes, and promoted green jobs. The Green New Deal for Public Schools called for the passing of the Green New Deal or Public Schools Act, which includes funding toward green facilities, educators and support staff, comunity engagement, and accessibility. The Green New Deal Slate endorsed local candidates running on the Green New Deal platform. Members of the slate, Hugo Soto-Martinez in California, Elisabeth Epps in Colorado, Rachel Ventura in Illinois, and Sarahana Shrestha in New York were elected in the November 2022 general elections.</p></bioghist></c><c id="aspace_2d3c8ed8e937f36acce4f44bab4d9a36" level="file"><did><unittitle>Religious Socialism</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/992646</unitid><unitdate datechar="Captured" normal="2018-10-30/2018-10-30">October 2018-ongoing</unitdate><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/6338/*/https://www.religioussocialism.org/" xlink:role="external-link" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Religious Socialism Archived Website" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Religious Socialism Archived Website: October 2018-ongoing</p></daodesc></dao><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/6338/*/http://feeds.feedburner.com/religioussocialismpodcast/" xlink:role="external-link" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Religious Socialism Podcast Archived Website" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Religious Socialism Podcast Archived Website: January 2020-May 2022</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_590ad10e231e1aac1f19999826817385"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The site manages regular blogs and podcasts.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_c5915acc2fd48ab9a9685a110ace2c94"><head>Historical Note</head><p>The Democratic Socialists of America's Religion and Socialism Commission, founded by John Court, seeks to build coalitions between progressive people of different faiths and advance conversations that bridge theology and socialist politics.</p></bioghist></c><c id="aspace_52995fd2a074ef13c26797f4b161d4c7" level="file"><did><unittitle>National Electoral Committee</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/992464</unitid><unitdate datechar="Captured" normal="2018-10-30/2018-10-30">October 2018-ongoing</unitdate><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/6338/*/https://electoral.dsausa.org/" xlink:role="external-link" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Democratic Socialists of America National Electoral Committee Archived Website" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Democratic Socialists of America National Electoral Committee Archived Website: October 2018-ongoing</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1a35e9c69b42a6ecf12e9aad8bc46efe"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The website contains endorsements, training and support, and endorsement applications.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_e0d8af1568f58ae431ad3cd9da00381c"><head>Historical Note</head><p>The National Electoral Committee is the DSA national body empowered to execute the National Political Committee's political strategy by assisting locals and recommending national endorsements.
