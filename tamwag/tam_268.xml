    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Sol Yurick (1925-2013) was an American author based in New York City, who was best known for novels portraying poverty and urban life in the 1960s and 1970s. Born in Manhattan on January 18, 1925, Yurick grew up in the Bronx where he attended the Bronx High School of Science. After high school he enlisted in the United States Army where he trained as a surgical technician during World War II. Following his military service he enrolled in New York University and graduated with a BA in English in 1951. He later received an MA in English from Brooklyn College.
Yurick worked for several years as an investigator for the New York City Department of Welfare. His first book, <emph render="italic">The Warriors</emph>, drew from his experience with the Department of Welfare and portrayed gang violence as a product of poverty rather than social dysfunction. Loosely based on the classical Greek story <emph render="italic">Anabasis</emph>, Yurick sought to provide a more accurate portrayal of gang violence that contrasted the glamorized images in pop culture such as <emph render="italic">West Side Story</emph>.  <emph render="italic">The Warriors</emph> was later turned into a motion picture in 1979, which garnered a strong cult following.</p><p>Yurick's next two novels <emph render="italic">Fertig</emph> (1966) and  <emph render="italic">The Bag</emph> (1968) likewise reflected Yurick's views on urban poverty and municipal bureaucracy. <emph render="italic">Fertig</emph>, which tells the story of a father who seeks revenge on hospital administrators and doctors whose neglect contributed to the death of his son, serves as a critique of health care bureaucracy. His novel <emph render="italic">The Bag</emph> focused  on race and class relations in 1960s on the streets of New York City. <emph render="italic">Fertig</emph>, was also adapted into a film, which was retitled <emph render="italic">Confession</emph> (1999), and featured Alec Baldwin and Ben Kingsley. Yurick's other works include a collection of short stories titled <emph render="italic">Someone Just Like You</emph> (1972); an anthology titled <emph render="italic">Voices of Brooklyn</emph> (1973); and several novels including, <emph render="italic">An Island Death</emph> (1976), <emph render="italic">Richard A</emph> (1981), and <emph render="italic">Behold Metatron: The Recording Angel</emph> (1985). He also wrote several essays and short stories for the academic journal <emph render="italic">Social Text</emph>, and in the 1960s contributed to the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) tract "Who Runs Columbia".</p><p>Yurck lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn with his wife Adrienne. He died in January of 2013.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection was received in two separate donations. Upon receiving the second accession in 2014, materials were moved into archival housing, a preliminary file list was created, and a collection-level finding aid was created to describe materials from both of these accessions. No physical processing or arrangement was done at this time.</p><p>At the time of accessioning, disk images were made of born-digital records in the collection. These materials have not been described.</p><p>In 2017, materials in under-filled boxes were condensed and box numbers were updated to reflect changes in the extent of the collection.</p><p>In December 2024, digital objects for processed electronic records were created to conform to current practices. The inventory was reorganized so that individual formats were listed separately. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection principally consists of typed manuscripts of novelist Sol Yurick's published and unpublished works. Yurick's writings include numerous drafts of his novels, essays, short stories, and plays. These manuscripts cover much of Yurick's career from his early writings in the mid-1940s to the early 2000s. The collection contains several versions of his drafts, which show the various stages of Yurick's writing process, and contain the author's edits and revisions. Many of the manuscripts in this collection eventually resulted in published versions, but the collection also contains manuscripts of unpublished works.</p><p>The collection also contains a small number of materials related to Yurick's publications including correspondence with publishers, materials related to royalties, contracts, reviews, and documents related to film adaptations of Yurick's work. These materials include a small amount of personal items including correspondence with family and friends, journals, and papers related to Yurick's political activism.</p><p>Titles of Yurick's drafts have been maintained as best as possible. Many of these titles appear in abbreviated or alternate forms, which Yurick used throughout his editing process. Additionally, there are many cases in which the pages within Yurick's drafts appear out of order. Throughout the editing process, Yurick often included additional pages to his drafts or renumbered certain sections. Consequently, there are a number of instances where pages will appear to be repetitive, missing, or out of order. While this is partially reflective of Yurick's editing methodology, there are also a number of instances where loose drafts and fragments became out of order prior to being archived, the original order of which is difficult to discern.</p>  </scopecontent>
