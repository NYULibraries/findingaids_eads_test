Belfrage was summoned in 1953 to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), and in 1955, he was deported back to his native England. Belfrage then travelled to Cuba in 1961, and in 1962, travelled throughout South America before finally settling in Cuernavaca, Mexico. In 1973, Belfrage returned to the U.S. for the first time since 1955, on a publicity tour for a new book. Belfrage continued to write extensively until his last years. He died in Mexico on June 21, 1990.

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Cedric Belfrage, socialist, author, journalist, translator, and co-founder of the <title render="italic">National Guardian</title>, was born in London on November 8, 1904. He came from a conservative middle-class family and his father was a doctor. During his childhood and adolescence he attended public school, and at the age of twenty-one went to college at Cambridge University. His early career as a film critic began there, where he published his first article in <emph render="italic">Kinematograph Weekly</emph> on May 8, 1924.</p><p>In 1926 Belfrage travelled to New York where film criticism was a more profitable occupation. There he wrote for magazines and newspapers such as <emph render="italic">Picturegoer, Bioscope, The New York Herald Tribune, The Daily News,</emph> and <emph render="italic">Commercial Art</emph>. Belfrage's characteristic ironic humor is evident even in these early writings. In 1927 his career as a film critic propelled him further west, to Hollywood. He traveled by train and arrived with $23.00. He was hired by the<emph render="italic"> New York Sun</emph> and <emph render="italic">Film Weekly</emph> (based in London) as a Hollywood correspondent. In 1928 he was married to Virginia Bradford, a Hollywood starlet, whom he divorced about two years later.</p><p>Belfrage returned to London in 1930 as Sam Goldwyn's press agent. Once there, Lord Beaverbrook of the <emph render="italic">Sunday Express</emph> (later <emph render="italic">Daily Express</emph>) soon hired him and in 1932 sent him back to Hollywood as the paper's correspondent. <emph render="italic">The Express</emph> sent him on another film criticism journey in 1934, this time around the world. This voyage provided Belfrage with the material for his first book, <emph render="italic">Away From It All</emph> (published in 1937 by Gollancz, Simon and Schuster, and Literary Guild, and in 1940 by Penguin). It was also during this voyage that Belfrage became politicized. Not only did he witness the poverty brought about by imperialism, but also "the advent of Hitlerism and the lack of alarm in the British ruling circles." (<emph render="italic">Guardian</emph> obituary, Jul 4, 1990)</p><p>When Gollancz accepted <emph render="italic">Away From It All</emph> in 1936, Belfrage resigned from the <emph render="italic">Express</emph> to settle back in Hollywood, with his new wife Molly Castle, and their daughter Sally. At this point he became politically active for the first time, joining the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and the Spanish Republican Committee, and co-editing a left literary magazine, <emph render="italic">The Clipper</emph>. He also collaborated with Theodore Dreiser on a book. <emph render="italic">Away From It All</emph> proved successful, and Belfrage soon began work on his second book, <emph render="italic">The Promised Land</emph>, dispelling various myths about Hollywood. In 1937, Belfrage met Claude Williams, a Presbyterian preacher from Arkansas, with whom he became fast friends and would have an on-going collaborative relationship. Williams was on a fund raising tour for his People's Institute of Applied Religion, a Christian Marxist organization in solidarity with southern sharecroppers and the Civil Rights movement. Belfrage wrote a biography of Williams that was published as <emph render="italic">Let My People Go</emph> in 1937 by Gollancz (and as <emph render="italic">South of God</emph> in 1938 by Left Book Club, and as<emph render="italic"> A Faith To Free The People </emph>in 1942 by Modern Age, Dryden Press and Book Find Club).</p><p>Belfrage's political engagement, which seems at this time to have centered on the broad based anti-fascist effort, led him to join the Communist Party in 1937. The fact the he withdrew his membership a few months later, and that he had only just begun to read Marx and Lenin, suggests that he joined because of the C.P.'s visible, accessible and organized protest against fascism, rather than because of any allegiance to the C.P. itself. After this break, Belfrage would maintain a friendly but critical relationship with the Communist Party.</p><p>In 1941, the Belfrage family, now including two year old Nicholas, moved to New York where Cedric served with British Intelligence. Also in 1941, he had an autobiography published, <emph render="italic">They All Hold Swords</emph> (Modern Age). He continued his work with British Intelligence until 1943, and in 1944 became a Press Control Officer in London for the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditional Forces (SHAEF) Psychological Warfare Division (PWD). He was sent in this capacity to France and then to Germany where his mission was to de-Nazify the German press by helping found the first anti-fascist newspaper in Germany after World War II, the <emph render="italic">Frankfurt Rundschau</emph>. At this time Belfrage met Jim Aronson who was working on the same project. The two would go on to found the <title render="italic">National Guardian</title> (along with Jack McManus) and become life-long best friends.</p><p>Belfrage returned to the U.S. in 1945, where he settled with his family in Croton-on-Hudson, New York. He received a Guggenheim fellowship to write <emph render="italic">Seeds of Destruction</emph>, his chronicle of de-Nazifying the German press, but the Cold War made its publication impossible until 1954 (Cameron &amp; Kahn). At this time, he also worked on his novel about the U.S. funeral industry, <emph render="italic">Abide With Me</emph> (Sloane Associates, N.Y., 1948, Secker &amp; Warburg, London, 1948, translated in Germany and Czechoslovakia). In 1947 his third child, Anne, was born.</p><p>In the summer of 1948, Belfrage travelled to southeast Missouri to visit Claude Williams. He spent several months there and was introduced to Claude's friends, Owen Whitfield (Whit), a black sharecropper preacher, and Thad Snow, a white cotton planter and Whit's neighbor. From them Belfrage learned about the Sharecropper's Strike of 1939, which was organized by Whit and Thad. He began writing a book on this event and these two men, but never completed it (though he took it up again in 1982), due to another project that came up: founding a newspaper.</p><p>The fall of 1948 marks the birth of The <title render="italic">National Guardian</title>, a progressive newsweekly. Its purpose was, as Belfrage put it in his address to the 1980 Meiklejohn Institute Symposium on HUAC, "to oppose head-on both the witch-hunts and the Cold War of which they were the domestic auxiliary," but on a strictly non-partisan basis. The paper also aimed to unify the left, as Belfrage explained in a 1986 <title render="italic">Guardian</title> interview: "There's apparently something about Marxism which makes its devotees fight each other like cats and dogs. And this was an attempt to stop that." (published in the Fall 1988 40th Anniversary Journal). This goal of unity typifies Belfrage's political stand, which was critical but always aiming to strengthen ties among leftist groups rather than emphasize differences.</p><p>The <title render="italic">National Guardian</title> drew its readership largely from the Progressive Party. The first issue featured an article by progressive Henry Wallace, whom the <title render="italic">National Guardian</title> endorsed as a presidential candidate on the independent ballot that year. The paper also found support in the American Labor Party. Congressman Vito Marcantonio was especially enthusiastic about the paper. It reported on such issues and events as the trial and execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, charged with 'atomic espionage' for the Soviet Union, the Korean War (the paper opposed it), the indictment of reporter Anna Louise Strong (<emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph> foreign correspondent) in the Soviet Union as a U.S. spy, the Trenton Six, the murder of Emmet Till, and the growth of the Civil Rights movement (it was the first American newspaper to have a Black History section). It supported national liberation struggles around the world: Africa in the 1950's, Southeast Asia in the 1960's and early 1970's, and Latin America in the 1980's. It also supported the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (in which Sally Belfrage was extremely active and about which she wrote her first book, <emph render="italic">Freedom Summer</emph>). The <title render="italic">National Guardian</title> was among the first papers to oppose the Vietnam War with on-scene reports from foreign correspondent Wilfred Burchett. Another cause taken up by the <title render="italic">National Guardian</title> was the defense of political prisoners such as Alger Hiss, Corliss Lamont, the Hollywood Ten, and Ann and Carl Braden, many of whom Belfrage knew personally and had an on-going correspondence with.</p><p>Due to such reportage the <title render="italic">National Guardian</title> was constantly harassed by the government, culminating in 1953 when Belfrage was summoned to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and Senator Joe McCarthy. Belfrage invoked the fifth amendment at his hearing in response to charges of being a Communist Party member. The next day he was arrested by immigration officials at his desk in the <title render="italic">National Guardian</title> office. Belfrage alone among the paper's staff was vulnerable to arrest due to his status as an alien; he had never obtained U.S. citizenship. He was taken to Ellis Island where he spent one month in jail.</p><p>But Belfrage's troubles with the government were not over and he was again arrested in 1955. This time he spent three months at the West Street Federal Penitentiary before he was deported (along with his third wife, Jo) back to his native England. There he became the editor-in-exile of the <title render="italic">National Guardian</title>. As a reporter, he travelled to India, East and West Europe, Israel, Russia (just after Nikita Krushchev's 1956 "Secret Speech" on Stalin), China, where in 1957 Belfrage was "the only person...reporting for an American publication" (1986 <title render="italic">Guardian</title> interview), and Ghana, where he renewed his friendship with W.E.B. DuBois. He also helped organize a British committee to obtain a U.S. passport for African-American singer Paul Robeson. In addition to reporting, Belfrage wrote a book at this time about his deportation experience, <emph render="italic">The Frightened Giant</emph> (Secker &amp; Warburg, London, 1956, Guardian Books, N.Y., 1957).</p><p>In 1961, Belfrage travelled to Cuba and in 1962 throughout South America. He used his experience in Cuba to write a historical novel, <emph render="italic">My Master Columbus</emph> (Secker &amp; Warburg, 1961, Doubleday, N.Y., 1962) and his South American experiences were published in 1963 as <emph render="italic">The Man at the Door With The Gun</emph> (Monthly Review Press). In the same year, Belfrage settled in Cuernavaca, Mexico with his fourth and last wife, Mary. There they ran a left-wing guest house and offered refuge to South American exiles.</p><p>In 1967 Belfrage resigned from the <title render="italic">National Guardian</title> (which then shortened its name to the <emph render="italic">Guardian</emph>), as did Aronson. The new <title render="italic">Guardian</title> staff wanted the paper to become an ideological leader of the New Left. Neither Belfrage nor Aronson could endorse this move, as they had deliberately founded the <title render="italic">Guardian</title> on a non-sectarian basis and as a unifying force on the left. As Belfrage wrote in a letter dated April 11, 1966 to staff member Jack Smith, "What seems beyond a doubt is that our non-sectarian radicalism is the main basis of the support we receive, the main thing <emph render="italic">NG</emph> has that other Left publications don't have...I would describe the paper as an organ and defender of, and newspaper of record for, all groups and individuals who are fighting the political and social status quo..." Belfrage's relations with the <title render="italic">Guardian</title> remained hostile for a time, though by the 1980's he was corresponding with the staff and writing book reviews and articles.</p><p>While 1967 marks the end of one phase in Belfrage's career, it also marks the beginning of a new one. He made his debut as a Spanish/English translator with Eduardo Galeano's <emph render="italic">Guatemala Occupied Country</emph> (Monthly Review Press). He achieved great success in this field and was extremely talented. From about 1970 to 1973 Belfrage's main project was researching and writing his book on the McCarthy era, <emph render="italic">The American Inquisition</emph> (Bobbs Merrill, 1973, Siglo XXI, Mexico, Thunder' Mouth Press, 1989). In 1973, Belfrage returned to the U.S. for the first time since 1955 (after a lengthy campaign to obtain a visa) on a publicity tour for his new book. He lectured at universities and to left organizations throughout the country.</p><p>In 1981 Belfrage suffered a stroke which partially paralyzed his left hand. He continued to write extensively until his last years. He translated Eduardo Galeano's trilogy on Latin America,<emph render="italic"> Memory of Fire</emph> (Pantheon, 1985), for which he received much acclaim. He also began writing (but never finished) a memoir, and a book on his time in Hollywood, focusing on the social and cultural side rather than the political, and returned to his book on Thad and Whit. He also began biographies on the Mexican Revolutionary, Emiliano Zapata, and the Spanish priest Las Casas who befriended the natives at the time Spain conquered Mexico. Belfrage's sense of humor remained sharp during his last years as is evident in various short writings such as an <emph render="italic">Encyclopedia of Useless Information</emph>, and a novel about a nudist colony. In addition to writing, he was active with Mary in the aid of South American refugees, and together they continued to welcome friends and comrades to their home. He died in Mexico on June 21, 1990.</p><p><emph render="bold">BOOKS BY CEDRIC BELFRAGE</emph><list><item>'Away From It All.'

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of Cedric Belfrage span the years 1922-1990, with the bulk of the material from 1945-1985. The collection consists mainly of Belfrage's writings both published and unpublished. The writings include articles, travel notes, translations, short fiction and non-fiction essays, book manuscripts and research files, and related correspondence. However, the collection does not fully reflect Belfrage's career as an author since there is little information on many of his published books. The collection also contains correspondence (mostly incoming), documentation of Belfrage's political activities, and biographical materials.</p><p>The collection provides substantial information about the early part of Belfrage's life as a Hollywood film critic (1920's-1930's), but very little about his subsequent activity in Germany as a press control officer for the U.S. army (1944-1945), though he maintains correspondence with Emil Carlebach, Buchenwald survivor and Communist, whom he met in Germany and about whom he wrote an article. His trip to Southeast Missouri in 1948 is very well documented in the form of writing and research for a book he later began (but never published) about two people he met there. They were the organizers of the Sharecroppers Strike of 1939, Owen Whitfield, a black sharecropper, and Thad Snow, a white farmer. Belfrage's next major project, the founding of the <emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph> in the fall of 1948, is well documented. Information on his involvement with this paper, and detailed correspondence with the co-founder and Belfrage's best friend, Jim Aronson, spans the rest of his life.</p><p>The collection also provides documentation of his deportation case and time in jail, mostly in the form of articles about him and correspondence. The next period in his life, as editor-in-exile for the <emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph>, during which he travelled extensively as a journalist, is less well covered. The main forms of documentation are articles by him, travel notes, and correspondence. The collection covers more thoroughly the final period of Belfrage's life, from the time he settles in Mexico in 1973 to his death in 1990. This time span is best chronicled by correspondence, and book and translation projects. Belfrage's evolving political position is well documented, especially regarding the rise of fascism and anti-Semitism in the 1930's, World War II in the 1940's, McCarthyism in the 1950's, Cuba in the 1960's, and Latin American countries in general in the 1970's and 1980's. His ambivalent relationship to the Communist Party and the Soviet Union is an on-going theme both in his writings and correspondence. The collection provides a detailed record of Belfrage's relations with friends and family, in the form of correspondence, though it is almost all incoming.</p>  </scopecontent>

Most of the topics covered by these letters are personal, relating to family matters, arranging visits, and the goings-on of everyday life. Sally's career as a writer and Anne's as a linguist are also well documented, and they often write about Belfrage's writing projects, helping to find publishers or offering criticism. Sally's participation in the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and her 1964 summer in Mississippi as a civil rights activist about which she wrote her first book, <emph render="italic">Freedom Summer</emph>, is covered in detail. There is also a short but interesting correspondence between Anne (who grew up in Paris) and Belfrage about the worker and student uprising in Paris in May 1968, especially regarding the role of the Communist Party. Most of the correspondence from Belfrage's son, Nick, is about his love life and his career as a wine taster. There is also correspondence from Belfrage's sister-in-law, Joyce Belfrage, regarding the poor health of his brother, Bruce.</p><p>General correspondence is mostly with political colleagues discussing their and Cedric's writing projects, current events, and developments in leftist and socialist movements. The primary correspondent in this section in Jim Aronson (1955 - 1990). While this correspondence is mostly incoming, there is a substantial amount from Belfrage to Aronson. They discuss mostly personal issues such as health, family, and their respective publishing projects. They also write about the problems of the <emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph> (see Wilfred Burchett correspondence and the <emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph> section for more) and current events. In 1979, while Aronson is teaching journalism in Peking, they have a major disagreement about China's presence in Vietnam that threatens their friendship.</p><p>Another primary correspondent is Claude Williams (1938-1980), a southern Marxist Christian preacher and the founder of The People's Institute of Applied Religion, about whom Belfrage wrote a biography (appearing variously as <emph render="italic">Let My People Go</emph>, 1937; <emph render="italic">South of God</emph>, 1938,<emph render="italic"> A Faith to Free The People</emph>, 1944) . This correspondence is mostly about Claude's work and his collaborative unfinished book project with Belfrage, The People's Book, aka, The Scarlet Thread, a revolutionary reading of the Bible. Belfrage also corresponds with Paul Robeson (1956-1965) regarding the National Paul Robeson Committee (this correspondence is mostly with the secretary of this committee, Frank Loesser). Related to the Robeson correspondence is the correspondence of sisters Hannah and Peggy Middleton (London County Council Member for Greenwich, and Labour candidate for Parliament). This consists of letters from Peggy to Hannah about Robeson. Included are notes by Belfrage on this correspondence. W.E.B. DuBois and his wife Shirley Graham (1955-1964) correspond with Belfrage about DuBois's world tour, and a tribute to DuBois that Belfrage helps organize.</p><p>The correspondence with organizations is mostly with journals, magazines and newspapers regarding the publication of Belfrage's articles and letters to the editor. Among the journals is <emph render="italic">Third World</emph>, of which Belfrage was an editor. There is also a short but interesting correspondence with the South Paddington Labour Party (1956-1957) in which Belfrage debates whether or not to join and elaborates on his reasons for not wanting to sign an oath of "political purity."</p><p>The second section of general correspondence is arranged alphabetically by country or region of origin. It is mostly with friends and political colleagues about personal issues such as health, family and career, but there is also discussion of politics and current events.</p><p>Africa: The main figures in the African section are Conor Cruise O'Brien, the Irish Vice Chancellor of the University of Ghana about 'black native power,' and Alfred Kgokong of the African National Congress regarding Belfrage's support of that organization.</p><p>Asia: The key writer from the Asian section is Anna Louise Strong who was the <emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph> correspondent in Peking during the 1960's.</p><p>Australia/New Zealand: This section contains only a few letters. Among them are a letter on Belfrage's behalf by John Baker to the Australian Broadcasting Commission regarding publicity for The American Inquisition, a letter from Disarmament Research Group in Australia asking for a Cuban contact, and two letters from Noel Wilson of New Zealand regarding Jamaican trade unionist Ferdinand Smith.</p><p>Canada: The major figures from the Canadian correspondence are Sol Pomerance, Beryl Wheelon (regarding Castro and Cuba) and Betty Madiros of the Socialist Fellowship Seminar where Belfrage spoke on Latin American politics. This correspondence also pertains to surgery that Belfrage had in Canada in 1975 and 1979.</p><p>Caribbean and Central America: This section features Rosa Hilda Zell, the Cuban poet, and Steve Nelson of the Libreria El Porvenir in Costa Rica who write often of their respective projects. Europe: Comprised mainly of letters from France and Germany. The main correspondents are Wilfred Burchett who writes from Paris in the late 1960's, Victor Grossman of the Deutsche Akademie Der Kunste Zu Berlin in Berlin regarding a donation to the Paul Robeson archive (1966), and Franz Loesser regarding his book on the Rosenbergs (1975-76).</p><p>Ireland/United Kingdom: Contains correspondence between Belfrage and K. Zilliacus about the Soviet-Yugoslav conflict (1950), the Cold War and the National Peace Party (1950's), Cuba (1962), and the British Labor Party (1965). Also in this section Belfrage corresponds with Joan Robinson (a Cambridge professor) (5/76) about China's position on Angola, Clive Jenkins of the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staff, and Heinrich Fraenkel of The New Statesman.</p><p>Mexico: Clive B. Smith and Charles Small are the main correspondents in the Mexico section. Small writes about the Chilean political situation, and on behalf of refugees. In 1973 he has an argument with Belfrage over his review of The American Inquisition. There is a short series of letters in 1963 from Carlos Fuentes about Cedric renting his apartment in Mexico.</p><p>South America: This section is mostly in Spanish. It contains several letters from the Peoples' Progressive Party in British Guyana about articles by Belfrage for them, from Harry Drayton of the University of Guyana about the political situation in that country, and from Maurice Bazin in Brazil about Brazil and Portugal.</p><p>United States: This is the largest section. Some of the prominent figures from whom Belfrage receives letters are Theodore Dreiser and Erich Fromm in the 1940's, Anna Louise Strong in the 1950's, Rockwell Kent in the 1960's, Alger Hiss in the 1970's, Virginia Durr and Serge Chermayeff in the 1980's, and Pete Seeger (undated). Some of the most frequent U.S. correspondents are Lorna D. Smith regarding the Civil Rights movement in the south and Stokeley Carmichael, Maxwell Geismar regarding his writings, politics and U.S. leftist periodicals, and Decca Treuhaft. Some of the major topics covered are events in Cuba in the early 1960's, Theodore Dreiser's death (1963-64), the endorsement of McGovern's presidential campaign (1972), Third World leftist politics (c.1979-1981), and Belfrage's participation in the Meiklejohn Civil Liberties Union "Are You or Have You Ever Been?" symposium (1980). In an outgoing letter (Sep 1974) to Carl Braden Belfrage discusses Marxism, revolution and party organization.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref17" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries II:A:

contains three subseries: Belfrage's press control activity in Germany, his deportation, and the  <emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph>. The Germany section is the smallest, containing mostly travel orders from the U.S. Army (see also unpublished writings, circa 1947, for two short manuscripts on this topic). The deportation section is the largest and contains mostly articles about Belfrage, correspondence, and legal documents from his case. There are a few articles here about Russian espionage charges against Belfrage (1949) (see obituaries for a discussion of these charges). The <emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph> section mostly contains correspondence, articles by Belfrage, and his notes on the events covered in the paper (see also <emph render="italic">Something to Guard</emph>, Belfrage and Aronson's book about the <emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph> in the writings section). There is a fair amount of documentation on the founding and early years of the paper, and a brief but important series of letters from 1967 that chronicle Belfrage and Aronson's resignation from the paper.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref86" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries III:A: German Press Control</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1944/1946" type="inclusive">1944-1946</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_ref87" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Psychological Warfare Division (Pwd), Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (Shaef).</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1944/1945" type="inclusive">1944-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_9cdfa7759230751c820de911161df111" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214299]" type="Box">8</container><container id="aspace_0ea908a922ca75bfa90d3c18335bb881" parent="aspace_9cdfa7759230751c820de911161df111" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref88" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>U.S. Army and German Newspapers.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1945/1946" type="inclusive">1945-1946</unitdate><container id="aspace_4d6bee51abef410892a2c2e8052dc411" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214299]" type="Box">8</container><container id="aspace_e94c1b7c6e0f41e5efa8fbd17de27177" parent="aspace_4d6bee51abef410892a2c2e8052dc411" type="Folder">6</container><container altrender="OS Flat Box - 15x19x3" id="aspace_174bd67e5287f75e9338f357cd3d7ae0" label="Mixed Materials [31142062667350]" type="Box">Shared Tamiment 043</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref89" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries III:B: Deportation</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1944/1989" type="inclusive">1944-1989</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_ref90" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Government records of C.B.'s political activities and writings.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1939/1959" type="inclusive">ca.1949</unitdate><container id="aspace_013e232c459403a65cf004bba682dfb1" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214299]" type="Box">8</container><container id="aspace_a67d3775492b26c6c07c677c9f53bf14" parent="aspace_013e232c459403a65cf004bba682dfb1" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref91" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Foreign press articles on C.B.'s Espionage charges.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1949/1949" type="inclusive">1949</unitdate><container id="aspace_fb2740a700ad83af085e7920b8c5de8b" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214299]" type="Box">8</container><container id="aspace_810f3101eb5d2bd6ce0abf6e58baa40b" parent="aspace_fb2740a700ad83af085e7920b8c5de8b" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref92" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>C.B.'s Arrest and deportation case: Congressional Record, <title render="italic">National Guardian</title>Press Releases, Notes.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1952/1953" type="inclusive">1952-1953</unitdate><container id="aspace_a30f94772e147b21f57e34afcc750b47" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214299]" type="Box">8</container><container id="aspace_1d892a127e083db17d601aba826f4e85" parent="aspace_a30f94772e147b21f57e34afcc750b47" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref93" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Jim Aronson and C.B.'s testimony before Committee On Government Operations.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1953/1953" type="inclusive">1953</unitdate><container id="aspace_40ff81f1c6c125c83be0d80d4027f11c" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214299]" type="Box">8</container><container id="aspace_302143bd4db527694669190fc41b7d8a" parent="aspace_40ff81f1c6c125c83be0d80d4027f11c" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref94" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>British articles on C.B.'s arrest and deportation case.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1953/1953" type="inclusive">1953</unitdate><container id="aspace_a7373f7f28621152edc93ef78007dfe3" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214299]" type="Box">8</container><container id="aspace_3b906a3f8e7fdf2923a3866d259b0e6b" parent="aspace_a7373f7f28621152edc93ef78007dfe3" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref95" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Portrait of an Undesirable Alien: article about C.B. by Frank Scully.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1943/1963" type="inclusive">ca.1953</unitdate><container id="aspace_bc2ab7a63f02e5d25ba52af81037023d" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214299]" type="Box">8</container><container id="aspace_9b2b4714edcac37ba850a57ab0bcf65c" parent="aspace_bc2ab7a63f02e5d25ba52af81037023d" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref96" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Meeting to Defend C.B.

Note</head><p>Writings contains 12 subseries. The first consists of published and unpublished articles, travel notes, and translations. There is substantial documentation of Belfrage's two trips to Cuba (1961-1962 &amp; 1975-1977), including notes, articles and correspondence. There is a long correspondence with Belfrage's friend and colleague, Eduardo Galeano about Belfrage's translation of his trilogy, <emph render="italic">Memory of Fire</emph>.</p><p>Several sub-series document Cedric's published book projects and contains typescripts, correspondence and research files. There is a large section of writing and correspondence for the section of Belfrage's book, <emph render="italic">The Frightened Giant</emph> (about his deportation) called, The Admiral (1955-1965). This is about Scotty MacKenzie, who posed as a Naval admiral for many years, whom Belfrage met in jail. There is also a substantial section of Something to Guard materials, mostly reviews, notes and correspondence (1974-1980). The American Inquisition is the largest section (three linear feet). It consists mostly of research files which contain Belfrage's notes and source material. One linear foot exclusively contains information on the case of Miami lawyer Leo Sheiner who was taken before the Florida Supreme Court for alleged Communist Party affiliations, and on the `Red Cases' of several Miami residents taken before the House Un-American Activities Committee for the same reason. There is also a great deal of research on the atomic espionage cases of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg and Morton Sobell. The American Inquisition section documents Belfrage's 1973 publicity tour in the U.S., his first time back since his deportation in 1955, and his continuing campaign to obtain visas to visit the U.S.</p><p>Other sub-series contain unpublished writings. They are mostly book projects, but there are also numerous shorter pieces. The two longest projects are his book on Owen Whitfield and Thad Snow (Belfrage's fictional name for Owen Whitfield is Hugh Goodrum), and his Hollywood book and memoir. The Hollywood section contains many of Belfrage's articles as a film critic, manuscripts of chapters, and a small amount of correspondence and source material. There is also a short general memoir project including chapter notes on people who played influential roles in his life and an autobiographical outline. Most of the shorter pieces are light-hearted, humorous spoofs on miscellaneous topics. There are also two short manuscripts on Belfrages' German press control activities (circa 1947).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref142" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries IV:A: Travel Notes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1956/1977" type="inclusive">1956-1977</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_ref143" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Travel notes from Russia.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1956/1956" type="inclusive">1956</unitdate><container id="aspace_87141c658060bcf7db609fea63ba0826" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214315]" type="Box">10</container><container id="aspace_ff1318bb03a3a1d01f440d203e60d98c" parent="aspace_87141c658060bcf7db609fea63ba0826" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref144" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Travel notes from Ghana and Rome.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1957/1957" type="inclusive">1957</unitdate><container id="aspace_76dc3fbdc07de71b01d0aa257cb8d769" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214315]" type="Box">10</container><container id="aspace_d18f28d0fe481e34d4dfe83f55eb2db4" parent="aspace_76dc3fbdc07de71b01d0aa257cb8d769" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref145" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Travel notes from China and correspondence.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1957/1958" type="inclusive">1957-1958</unitdate><container id="aspace_61ac48dcc085031795f1dfccdd3492ce" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214315]" type="Box">10</container><container id="aspace_af241356a3a80537b7920ed3b1c0c2d9" parent="aspace_61ac48dcc085031795f1dfccdd3492ce" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref146" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Conference in Cairo; Notes and articles.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1958/1958" type="inclusive">1958</unitdate><container id="aspace_d22319894f45f0ac9478b4bb10d4744c" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214315]" type="Box">10</container><container id="aspace_2c93536698365e440b69863c00dd4003" parent="aspace_d22319894f45f0ac9478b4bb10d4744c" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref147" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Travel notes from Israel.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1959/1959" type="inclusive">1959</unitdate><container id="aspace_0c88396ad06961bbc6db0874688a7926" label="Mixed Materials [31142042214315]" type="Box">10</container><container id="aspace_43b3c47149688d70c947b0555fd89161" parent="aspace_0c88396ad06961bbc6db0874688a7926" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref148" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Articles by C.B.
