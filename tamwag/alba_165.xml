In Spain he trained and fought with the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion. Weissman also fought with the United States Army in World War II. Weissman's work as an organizer for the Communist Party in the late 1940s led him to be charged and tried under the Smith Act for conspiring to advocate the overthrow of the U.S. government; the charges were eventually dismissed. Later in life, Weissman was an active member of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) and was editor of their newsletter, <title render="italic">The Volunteer</title>, for several years. This collection includes correspondence written by Weissman while in Spain and documents related to his participation in the Spanish Civil War and World War II. It also contains extensive subject files related to VALB activities, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, and to Weissman's writings</abstract>

<p>One box of the Irving Weissman Papers was donated by Irving Weissman to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives, then held at Brandeis University, in 1994. This material was transferred to the Tamiment Library, with the original acquisition of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives collections in January 2001. At that time a small Tamiment collection of Weissman material (Tam #226), comprised of itmes apparently donated by Weissman himself and material donated by Bolerium Books in 2000, was merged with the ALBA collection. In July of 2005, draft chapters of an autobiographical novel and other notes and manuscirpt fragments were donated by Robert Snyder and added to the collection. The accession NPA 2000.288 was added to this collection in 2015.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Irving Weissman (1913-1998) grew up in a Polish-Jewish immigrant family in New York City. In the early 1930s Weissman attended City College of New York for one year studying English literature and history. He quit school to work in a factory and help support his family. Weissman was a member of the Young Communist League and was active in the Fur and Leather Workers and the United Electrical Workers Unions. He participated in actions of unemployed and laid-off workers during the Depression. Weissman eventually got a Works Progress Administration (WPA) job teaching English to recent immigrants. He left this job to go to fight in the Spanish Civil War in 1937.</p><p>Weissman departed for Spain on the <emph render="italic">SS American Importer</emph>on May 8, 1937. In Spain, he trained with the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion and went into action with that Battalion on the Aragon front and at Fuentes de Ebro in September and October 1937. Weissman fell ill at the end of October and was sent to Barcelona with a delegation of the 15th International Brigade where he performed guard duties while he recovered. He rejoined the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion in December 1937. Weissman left Spain on December 15, 1938.</p><p>Upon his return to the United States Weissman worked as a ship's fitter in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was a member of the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America, Local 15 and was elected to the Union's grievance committee. Weissman served in the United States Army from 1942 to 1945. During World War II he fought in campaigns in North Africa, Italy, France, Belgium, and Germany. When he returned to the United States he accepted an assignment from the Communist Party--of which he was then a member--to be an organizer, first in western New York State, then in West Virginia.</p><p>In 1951 Weissman was arrested along with five other veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and Communist Party members and charged, under the Smith Act, with conspiring to advocate the overthrow of the United States government. Weissman was sentenced to five years in prison but the case was appealed. In 1956 the Supreme Court ruled that the case be retried and the new prosecutor's motion to dismiss the case was granted. In the intervening years Weissman had spent several months in jail while bail was raised and had served time for contempt of court for refusing to give names of Communist Party members on the witness stand. In the late 1950s Weissman left the Communist Party.</p><p>Weissman worked in building construction in New York from 1953 until his retirement in 1978. Throughout this time and for the rest of his life he was active in neighborhood politics and with the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB). Weissman headed a campaign to secure pension rights for Polish-Jewish veterans of the Botwin Company, some of whom were charging the Polish authorities with anti-Semitism. He was also editor of <title render="italic">The Volunteer</title>for several years during the 1980s. When his wife Freda died in the early 1990s Weissman moved from New York to San Francisco to be near his daughters and grandchildren. He remained active with VALB on the west coast, helping to raise funds for a monument in Seattle. Irving Weissman died of congestive heart failure on December 20, 1998.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>Series I, Spanish Civil War and World War II Era, 1937-1946. The bulk of this series consists of correspondence written by Irving Weissman to his sister Sara and his parents from Spain between May 1937 and October 1938. Two letters are written in Yiddish, using the Roman alphabet. Weissman wrote long, detailed letters about his journey to Spain, the landscape, his training, life in the barracks, and his experiences on the fronts. The economic hardships that his family was facing at home in the United States are discussed as well as his parents' worries for their son's safety. Weissman's letters provide evidence of his political convictions as well as how his point of view evolved as a result of experiencing war first hand. As well as writing to his family, Weissman wrote to friends and political comrades and he maintained contact with an imprisoned Spanish comrade, Jose Ferando Ventura, after returning to the United States. This series contains documents related to the Spanish Civil War and to Weissman's service in the United States Army during World War II, most notably, a diary he kept while serving in Europe. The series also contains union cards and documents that reveal some of Weissman's activities and areas of employment in the years between the two wars.</p><p>Series II, Subject Files, 1951-1996 (bulk 1977-1996). This series consists of correspondence, essays and articles, and other documents related to Weissman's activities with the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) and his position as editor of their newsletter, The Volunteer. Correspondence in this series is mostly incoming and third party correspondence sent or forwarded to Weissman by other VALB members. VALB members represented in this collection include Theodore (Ted) Cogswell, Carl Geiser, Ben Iceland, Edward Lending, Abe Osheroff, Abe Smorodin, Morris Stamm, and Robert Steck. The series contains letters and writings by these and other veterans. This series also contains records relating to VALB activities, particularly those in New York but also regional and national efforts. Included in the VALB files are a copy of the VALB and American Medical Bureau Names List compiled by Ted Cogswell, records related to some of the organization's bureaus and commissions, and documents on VALB's campaign to send aid to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Weissman's work on behalf of Polish-Jewish Spanish Civil War veterans is well documented in this series. Finally, the series contains essays, articles, and book reviews written by Weissman.</p>  </scopecontent>
