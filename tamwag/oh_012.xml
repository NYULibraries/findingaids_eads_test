    <abstract id="aspace_1533d8bef2d1e3427d33717569b2fddf">In 1972, two Eastern Airlines flight attendants, Sandra Jarrell and Jan Fulsom, took Eastern to court on charges of discriminatory weight and grooming regulations. They decided to band together with other women to fight discrimination and sexism throughout the industry. They founded Stewardesses for Women's Rights in 1973. Great progress was made in the next few years toward better working conditions, equal treatment with male co-workers, and removing hazardous cargo from passenger flights. By 1976, many SFWR members had become involved in their airlines' respective unions, and the SFWR ended due to declining membership and lack of funding.

The collection is comprised of two oral history interviews of former SFWR members taken by Sarah Rapport, the recording an event regarding SFWR, a recording of a SFWR commercial, a recording of a slideshow on labor rights for women flight attendants, and recording of an SFWR meeting.</abstract>

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>In 1972, two Eastern Airlines flight attendants, Sandra Jarrell and Jan Fulsom, took Eastern to court on charges of discriminatory weight and grooming regulations. They decided to band together with other women and fight discrimination and sexism throughout the industry, and Stewardesses for Women's Rights was founded. In March of 1973, they organized their first national conference held in New York City, hosted by Gloria Steinem. In June 1973, the Stern Family Fund granted the SFWR $25,000, which enabled them to open a national office in Rockefeller Center, New York City. Great progress was made in the next few years toward better working conditions, equal treatment with male co-workers, and removing hazardous cargo from passenger flights. Through their involvement with SFWR, many flight attendants became interested and active in their own unions, and thus drifted away from involvement with SFWR. Due to declining membership and lack of funding, SFWR closed its doors in the spring of 1976.</p>  </bioghist>
