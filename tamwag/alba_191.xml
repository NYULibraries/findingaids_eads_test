Robert served as first commander of the Lincolns and rose to the rank of chief of staff of the 15th International Brigade. Marion served the Brigade as a volunteer in several capacities. In November 1937, Marion returned to the United States to raise money for war by making speeches at rallies across the country. Robert disappeared during an ambush at Corbera (Ebro Valley) and his body was never found. Marion became active in the Bay Area Chapter of Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB). Later in her life, she co-wrote <title render="italic">American Commander in Spain: Robert Hale Merriman and the Abraham Lincoln Brigade</title>with journalist Warren Lerude. Robert Jordan, the main character in For Whom the Bell Tolls – Ernest Hemingway's Spanish Civil War novel – was apparently modeled after Robert Merriman. This collection contains a small amount of material from the Spanish Civil War, including letters from Robert to Marion before Marion joined him in Spain and two diaries he kept in Spain. The bulk of the collection consists of organizational materials documenting Marion's involvement in the Bay Area chapter of VALB. Three typescript versions of <title render="italic">American Commander in Spain</title>and additional material related to the writing of the book are also included.</abstract>

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Robert Hale Merriman (1908-1938) was a graduate student in economics at the University of California at Berkeley when he became interested in Russian economics. He had met his future wife Marion Stone when both were undergraduates at the University of Nevada; they married on their graduation day, May 9, 1932. The Merrimans moved to Moscow in January 1935. An excursion to Vienna gave Robert and Marion a firsthand view of Nazism and motivated Robert, who had received some basic military training in ROTC as a undergraduate at the University of Nevada, to join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in 1937. In Spain, Robert trained other U.S. volunteers and eventually rose to the rank of chief of staff of the 15th International Brigade. At first, Marion remained in Moscow, working for a <title render="italic">New York Times</title>correspondent Walter Duranty. She came to Spain in March of 1937 to tend to Robert after he was wounded by a gunshot to the shoulder in the Battle of Jarama. After his recovery, Marion remained in Spain and served the brigade as a clerk. Marion also worked in a hospital, held various staff jobs, collected information for death certificates, and led tours for visiting celebrities. She was eventually promoted to the rank of corporal. In November 1937, Marion returned to the United States to raise money for the cause. She made numerous speeches at rallies across the country and returned to San Francisco in March 1938, where she worked as a secretary for a group raising medical aid for the Loyalists.</p><p>After Robert Merriman disappeared, during an ambush at Corbera (Ebro Valley), conflicting reports stated that he was being held by fascist forces or that he had been killed. Unsuccessful appeals were made urging the U. S. State Department to press for his release, including a petition from UC Berkeley professors and UC President Robert Gordon Sproul. Merriman's body was never found but by 1938 he was presumed dead.</p><p>Marion was eventually remarried, to attorney Emil Wachtel. She had three sons with Wachtel, who died in 1977. She held various jobs throughout her life and continued for many years to be active in the Bay Area Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB). She took several trips to Spain after the death of Francisco Franco, and worked strenuously to keep Robert Merriman's memory alive. Later in her life, she co-wrote <title render="italic">American Commander in Spain: Robert Hale Merriman and the Abraham Lincoln Brigade</title>(University of Nevada Press, 1986) with journalist and University of Nevada faculty member Warren Lerude. Robert Jordan, the main character in <title render="italic">For Whom the Bell Tolls</title>– Ernest Hemingway's Spanish Civil War novel – was apparently modeled after Robert Merriman.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>This collection contains a small amount of material from the Spanish Civil War including two of Robert Merriman's diaries and letters from Robert to Marion Merriman before she joined him in Spain. The bulk of the collection consists of materials related to the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB). Marion Merriman corresponded with and collected material on many Lincoln veterans. There is also organizational material from the national office and Bay Area chapter of VALB. Files related to the writing of <title>American Commander in Spain</title> include notes, correspondence, three typescript versions (an early draft, an edited version and a final manuscript), reviews, publicity material and letters from readers. Artifacts (Series IV) consist of two printed items owned by Robert before the Spanish Civil War, a belt worn by Marion and two hats and six garments owned by Robert in the Spanish Civil War years. Additional clippings, articles, photographs, and correspondence regarding Robert and Marion Merriman's experience during the Spanish Civil War and the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades are included in Series V: 2016 Accretion. These materials include drafts of Marion Merriman's writings, newspaper clippings regarding Robert's disappearance and death, and an assortment of articles and newsletters about Lincoln Brigade veterans.

Hale Merriman. These materials largely consist of articles and essays about Robert Merriman's service with the Abraham Lincoln Brigades in Spain and stories about his death in 1938. They include newspaper clippings from the 1930s as well as articles and essays written about Robert and Marion Merriman in the 1970s and 1980s. The collection contains several photographs of Robert and Marion Merriman in Spain during the war as well as photographs of Marion later in her life. The series includes several files of newspaper clippings, scholarly articles, and essays about the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades (VALB) that Marion Merriman collected in the years after the Spanish Civil War. Several files relate to Marion's work on her 1986 biography of Robert, <emph render="italic">American Commander in Spain</emph>, which she wrote with Warren Larude. Also included in the series are transcripts of Robert's diaries, photocopies of his letter letters, a scrapbook of clippings about the Spanish Civil War, and two audio reels of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_bc90af6e6dcf58ab49ce8230bd9d2103" level="file"><did><unittitle>Robert Merriman Education and Military Service</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1932/1986" type="inclusive">1932-1934, 1986</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_fd9aceb068884a0c3648ad9fe4719c92" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856557]" type="Box">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_a6cb2f3c91f710e4fa60cf37018b50de" level="file"><did><unittitle>Marion Merrman Wachtel Writings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1948/1956" type="inclusive">1948-1956, undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_434af823906733414af039653bb7f11d" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856557]" type="Box">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b4c8060e15bcae2b193c6f010dad4970" level="file"><did><unittitle>Robert and Marion Merriman Photographs</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1930/1980" type="inclusive">circa 1930-1980</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_fecc0123c657cdf7be4fbc745c70ac6d" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856557]" type="Box">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_833ec7fd82e3bf6fa484dc9de80bf2c2" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">Mac-Paps News Bulletin</emph></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1975/1981" type="inclusive">1975-1981</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_102efaf458b1901687e134e0330da6e5" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856557]" type="Box">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ffc45750849bcaa1c1e42c5911155c26" level="file"><did><unittitle>Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Clippings and Research Files</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1936/1986" type="inclusive">1936-1986</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_86e86fba3d2e6f317dcf48a111d10899" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856557]" type="Box">7</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_af66aba0f760110961c2da819e0d12d7" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856540]" type="Box">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_1e213560038471e16506ae2dcd29e5df" level="file"><did><unittitle>Scholarly Articles on the Spanish Civil War</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1939/1986" type="inclusive">1939-1986</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_65ab177b5fee1a7b3961a17dbe100898" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856540]" type="Box">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_855e2776f3ebd67c351492c5fb5f6498" level="file"><did><unittitle>Robert Merriman Diary Transcripts</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1980/1980" type="inclusive">1980</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_6989eee6b1126fda3887ff973a9075bd" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856540]" type="Box">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6fc0bad4adfea883d38aef77e13a1382" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lists of American Volunteers in Spain</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1983/1985" type="inclusive">1983-1985</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_05dcce78d23e7b780df19dad1f4fddfd" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856540]" type="Box">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_2f1edc6150b7679c48d79292355323b9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Spanish Civil War Scrapbook</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1937/1938" type="inclusive">1937-1938</unitdate><container altrender="Flat Box 11.75 x 15.5" id="aspace_7849e3d0b441ff9e3ef5d2cdffcea576" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856532]" type="Box">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_2f5c854a87c64c0bcc876309bc3b8465" level="file"><did><unittitle>Audio Recordings - Spain</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container altrender="Flat Box 11.75 x 15.5" id="aspace_2c72039dfaa7f54a77bc56a8c17fe8d7" label="Mixed Materials [31142054856532]" type="Box">9</container></did></c></c></dsc>
