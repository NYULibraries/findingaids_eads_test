    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Robert Edward Treuhaft, a radical left-wing attorney prominent in progressive and New Left politics in the San Francisco Bay Area, was born in the Bronx, New York City, in 1912, the oldest child of Hungarian Jewish immigrants.  He attended public schools and became the first person from his Brooklyn high school to be admitted to Harvard University.  He graduated from Harvard in 1934, and obtained a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1937.  After graduation from law school he worked for a labor law firm in New York City for, whose clients included the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.  In 1941, he took a position in Washington, D.C., with the enforcement division of the wartime Office of Price Administration (OPA).  At OPA, he met his future wife, Jessica Mitford Romilly (known as Decca Mitford, radical and rebellious daughter from a famously eccentric and conservative family of British aristocrats), who was also working at the agency.  In 1943 Treuhaft left the OPA and moved to the West Coast to work for the War Labor Board's San Francisco office and to join Mitford, who had also taken a job in San Francisco.  They married soon after their arrival to the Bay Area.
 
In 1945, Treuhaft joined the law firm of Gladstein, Grossman, Sawyer &amp; Edises.  At Gladstein he represented West Coast labor unions expelled from the CIO as a result of accusations that they were Communist-led or dominated.  A few years later he and Bertram Edises established their own firm.  They became well-known as civil rights attorneys when they successfully defended, Jerry Newson, an 18-year-old African American man, against a framed-up murder charge.  Treuhaft also acted as counsel for the East Bay Civil Rights Congress from 1949 to 1956, advocating for clients suffering racial discrimination and he brought pioneering police brutality suits against the Oakland Police department. </p><p>In 1963, Treuhaft and Doris "Dobby" Walker (a long-time friend and political ally of Treuhaft and Mitford's) founded their own law firm (through the years joined by different partners, beginning with Malcolm Burnstein, as well as numerous young associates and interns, including future Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during the summer of 1971).  Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Treuhaft, Walker &amp; Burnstein represented clients in civil rights cases (as well as handling more general law, such as wills and divorces, for clients among the African American and progressive communities in the area); they also became well-known for representing New Left organizations and activists.  Treuhaft acted as counsel for the Free Speech Movement, representing the more than 700 students arrested at the University of California at Berkeley during a two-day sit-in in 1964.  He himself was also arrested during the sit-in, at the direction of then- Assistant District Attorney of Alameda County, Edwin Meese, who later became Attorney General during the Reagan presidency.  In addition, Treuhaft and his firm represented anti-Vietnam War protesters, Black Panther Party, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and University of California students and town residents arrested during the struggle over People's Park in Berkeley.  Treuhaft's expansive vision of civil liberties included child custody cases in which he defended clients whose parental rights being challenged on the basis of their cultural lifestyles. 
 
As part of his lifelong concern for the rights and welfare of ordinary citizens, Treuhaft became interested in consumer rights and protections.  In 1962 he co-wrote a handbook for California lawyers on debtors' rights.   When he became aware of deceptive practices by funeral homes he helped to found the Bay Area Funeral Society to serve as a model for simpler and less expensive funerals, and took a year's leave of absence from his law practice to research the topic more deeply.  He also assisted his wife with writing <title render="italic">The American Way of Death</title>, an expose on the funeral industry based on his research.  Published in 1963, the <title render="italic">The American Way of Death </title>became an enormous (and to the Treuhafts, entirely unexpected) success, a bestselling book, and made Mitford--already a published writer--famous as a muckraking journalist, known for her special blend of investigative journalism with political satire.  As a consequence of the publicity surrounding the <title render="italic">American Way of Death</title> Treuhaft was appointed by California Governor Jerry Brown as a public member to the California State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers (much to the consternation of funeral directors throughout the country).  </p><p>Treuhaft also participated in local and community politics.  In 1966 he ran (and lost the race) for District Attorney for Alameda County against the longtime rightwing incumbent Frank Coakley.  He served several terms on the board of the Consumers Cooperative of Berkeley (better known as the Berkeley Co-Op),  a small group member-run supermarkets in the Bay Area, including one after a hotly-contested election campaign, in which he ran on a slate of progressives. He was also instrumental in getting the Co-Op board to pass a resolution cutting off its contributions to the national organization of co-operative stores, the Cooperative League of America, because it had accepted funds from the CIA.</p><p>In 1982, Treuhaft and Walker dissolved their partnership. From this time through his retirement in 1997  Treuhaft began to specialize in workers' compensation cases and appeals to the Social Security Administration.
 
Robert Treuhaft was also active in progressive attorneys' organizations such as the National Lawyers Guild (he served as a vice president and was honored by it, along with Mitford, with a testimonial dinner in 1985).  As a member of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers (IADL) he served on an mission to Portugal in 1964 to investigate torture of political prisoners (as a result he and fellow commission members were arrested and expelled from the country by the authoritarian government of Antonio Salazar), and to Okinawa in 1969 to investigate human rights violations by the United States.</p><p>Treuhaft and Jessica Mitford joined the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) in 1943 and remained members until 1958.  Treuhaft  provided legal representation for "unfriendly" witnesses subpoenaed by the U.S. House of Representatives' Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).  He himself and Mitford were called to testify before the Committee in 1953.  They refused to "name names," (that is, identify for the Committee their own or others' political affiliations or memberships). Treuhaft took issue publicly with those who did, including in a 1984 article in <title render="italic">The Nation</title> on his Harvard class' 50th reunion. As a consequence of this, and their other political activities the Treuhafts were constantly surveilled and frequently harassed by federal, state, and local government agencies, up to and including being denied passports.</p><p>Treuhaft and Mitford raised two children to adulthood—Benjamin, their second son (another son, Nicholas, died at age ten), and Constancia "Dinky" Romilly, Mitford's daughter from her first marriage.  Jessica Mitford died in 1996.  Treuhaft completed <title render="italic">The American Way of Death Revisited</title> (published 1998), the update of <title render="italic">The American Way of Death</title> Mitford had been working on at the time of her death.  Robert Treuhaft died on November 11, 2001.</p>  </bioghist>

Correspondence and receipts in the "red-baiting" folders (as they were originally labeled by Treuhaft or his office staff) document extensively his efforts to defend himself from attempts to dismiss him from his job at the Office of Price Adminstration on political grounds.  These same files contain numerous newspaper clippings, leaflets and publications report on the course of much of his political activity, albeit often in a biased or distorted manner, including accusations and attacks in the right-wing press and a scurrilous newsletter from a local Communist Party group; even an insurance claim that documenting what may have be a politically motivated deliberate damage to Treuhaft's automobile.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref138" level="file"><did><unittitle>Datebook, Calendar, and Address Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1933/1936" type="inclusive">1933-1934, 1936</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_5359b8978a068d6b9530ef5c89c25d5e" label="Mixed Materials [31142063397320]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_5359b8978a068d6b9530ef5c89c25d5e" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Datebook, Calendar, and Address Book	</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1950/1959" type="inclusive">1950s</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_bfa8a573c4986bfafa3eaf686fcd09ba" label="Mixed Materials [31142063397320]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_bfa8a573c4986bfafa3eaf686fcd09ba" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref10" level="file"><did><unittitle>Datebook, Calendar, and Address Books	</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1969" type="inclusive">1960s</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_d4f2c6ef61dcfcd007044a781b1f8e26" label="Mixed Materials [31142063397320]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_d4f2c6ef61dcfcd007044a781b1f8e26" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref11" level="file"><did><unittitle>Datebook, Calendar, and Address Books	</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1979" type="inclusive">1970s</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_793002594d9fb9d7858a9360cdd83568" label="Mixed Materials [31142063397320]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_793002594d9fb9d7858a9360cdd83568" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref12" level="file"><did><unittitle>Elementary and Junior High School Report Cards; Diptheria Vaccination Certificate	</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1920/1925" type="inclusive">1920-1925</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_4548b8df9dfd50fa2bd38b43a3328ffa" label="Mixed Materials [31142063397320]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_4548b8df9dfd50fa2bd38b43a3328ffa" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref13" level="file"><did><unittitle>FOIA -

(If not otherwise noted, attorneys are indicated by their initials on their original folders: RET for Treuhaft, DOB for Doris Walker, MB for Malcolm Burnstein).  Clients--defendants, plaintiffs, or targets of grand jury investigations--are mainly progressive or leftwing political organizations and individuals associated with these organizations or individuals involved in cases springing from political events.  Organizations and individuals associated with them include the Black Panther Party, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton; the Free Speech Movement (from the beginning, with the more than 700 arrested, through the appeals process), Mario Savio and Treuhaft himself; Civil Action Day Committee (clients arrested in a civil disobedience action at a draft induction center to protest conscription); and <title render="italic">Berkeley Barb</title> (newspaper), Robert Scheer, John Poland.  Briefs, statements and correspondence document Malcolm Burnstein's defense of eighteen members of the Black Panther Party arrested after its widely-publicized demonstration in front of and inside the California state capitol while armed with deliberately unconcealed rifles.  Documents from this file include handwritten statements from each of the defendants.  Files for Treuhaft clients arrested during the events of People's Park include what appear to be police surveillance photographs and audiotape obtained during the legal discovery process.  Case files for two child custody cases involving controversy over parents' lifestyle include the widely-publicized Mark Painter case.  Treuhaft also represented fellow Bay Area radical attorneys Faye Stender and Charles Garry (both in politically-associated contempt of court-related cases).   A small sample of workers' compensation cases  illustrate Treuhaft's work in this field, in which he specialized nearly exclusively during the last decade of his legal practice.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref70" level="file"><did><unittitle>Avakian, Robert <title render="italic">et al vs</title>.

The files of  poetry mostly consist of humorous rhyming doggerel written by Treuhaft and Mitford (either in tandem or separately) or on occasion by their friends (including poets and  writers like Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Paul Jarrico), produced for particular private celebrations like birthdays, anniversaries, and parties, and replete with topical and political as well as personal and biographical references.  Also included is an internal Communist Party document--a short resolution drafted by Jessica Mitford and submitted to the National Board of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) on behalf of the Twin Peaks Club, a Bay Area branch of the CPUSA.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref130" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The Academy and the First Amendment" (speech) - Manuscript, Clippings, Correspondence, Research Materials</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1968</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_2c629b4f635186302867e347d1269149" label="Mixed Materials [31142063397353]" type="Box">5</container><container parent="aspace_2c629b4f635186302867e347d1269149" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref162" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Criticism of the National Board: Resolution and Some Proposed Changes" (by Decca Treuhaft on behalf of Twin Peaks Club, California Communist Party)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1944</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_2dca577531aeaa8e9d23aa77760b563a" label="Mixed Materials [31142063397353]" type="Box">5</container><container parent="aspace_2dca577531aeaa8e9d23aa77760b563a" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref132" level="file"><did><unittitle>"From a Seat on California's Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers" -  Manuscripts, Correspondence, Clippings(for unpublished article for <title render="italic">New York Times</title>)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1978" type="inclusive">1976-1978</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_ddaab22a0334f75de33c8e04f2819c93" label="Mixed Materials [31142063397353]" type="Box">5</container><container parent="aspace_ddaab22a0334f75de33c8e04f2819c93" type="Folder">8</container></did><c id="aspace_ref131" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Debtors' Rights and Remedies" (published in <title render="italic">California Family Lawyer</title>)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1962/1962" type="inclusive">1962</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_a157cacd1ea459328000815d27b5d701" label="Mixed Materials [31142063397353]" type="Box">5</container><container parent="aspace_a157cacd1ea459328000815d27b5d701" type="Folder">7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f8f79b27ef05a29d94fef3f43ffab653"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>No Subnote Content</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_ref133" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Naming Namers: A Reunion to Remember" (published in <title render="italic">The Nation</title>)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1984/1984" type="inclusive">1984</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_1fac3de33b6f0d8923a76eac60580482" label="Mixed Materials [31142063397353]" type="Box">5</container><container parent="aspace_1fac3de33b6f0d8923a76eac60580482" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref134" level="file"><did><unittitle>Poetry</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1958/1990" type="inclusive">1958-1990, undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_852b772ff489606868e60e5e3d647e48" label="Mixed Materials [31142063397353]" type="Box">5</container><container parent="aspace_852b772ff489606868e60e5e3d647e48" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref136" level="file"><did><unittitle>Poetry</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1974/1974" type="inclusive">1974;
