Wagner Labor Archives Printed Ephemera Collection on the Communist Party of the United States of America consists of constitutions, convention proceedings, reports, memoranda and press releases as well as printed ephemera such as fliers, brochures, circular letters, newspapers clippings, pamphlets and publications. </p><p>Series I: CPUSA General Files, 1920-1987, contains a wide selection of printed material put out by the CPUSA at the national level. When noted, material has been separated by committee, commission or department, with a large portion coming from the Central Committee, the National Campaign Committee, and the National Education Department, though there are also files on the National Farm, Negro, Teachers, Veterans, and Women's Commissions. </p><p>Series II: CPUSA State and Local Files, 1929-1987, contains material generated by various state and local parties. Series II is broken down into two Sub-series, Sub-series A being material from New York State, District and City, and Sub-series B being material from all other states and locals. When noted, the material in Sub-series A is divided by department or committee, with a large portion coming from the National Education Department, in the form of club discussion guides, course curricula and publications relating to National Negro Week celebrated by the CPUSA in the early 1950s. This section also contains fliers, brochures, and pamphlets from the Election Campaign Committee outlining different electoral platforms and programs supported by the New York State Communist Party. There are also a number of pamphlets published by the New York State Communist Party included in this Sub-series as well. </p><p>Series III: Affiliated And Youth Organizations, 1918-1987, contains material put out by groups affiliated with the Communist Party of the United States of America.

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) was founded in 1919 by members of the left wing of the Socialist Party USA. The CPUSA played an important role in the labor movement, particularly in the building of the Congress of Industrial Organizations in the 1930s-1940s, in struggles for civil rights for African Americans. Its cultural initiatives in the 1930s attracted a number of prominent artists and intellectuals, and its struggles to attain and maintain its legality were an important chapter in the history of U.S. civil liberties. </p><p>In 2009, the Communist Party of the United States of America and the Library of the Reference Center for Marxist Studies donated its collection to the Tamiment Library. </p>  </bioghist>
