    <abstract id="aspace_6746b8dddccd76741df4d7dc27ec743b">The Rand School of Social Science (1906-1956), a school for workers and socialists which was associated with the Socialist Party, and after 1936 with the Social Democratic Federation, offered a variety of courses on contemporary topics, traditional subjects and socialist theory taught by intellectual leaders of the socialist movement, distinguished academicians and trade union leaders. In 1917 the Rand School purchased a six story building at 7 East 15th Street, that had an auditorium, a library, classrooms, and office space which was utilized by several socialist organizations. In a climate of anti-radical feeling after World War I, the Rand School came under attack by the Lusk Committee, created to investigate radical activities in New York. After a series of court cases the Rand School retained control of its operations, and programs and enrollment increased. Shortly after World War II, courses and enrollment decreased sharply. In January 1956 the Board of Directors of the American Socialist Society closed the Rand School and transferred the title of the school and its building to the People's Educational Camp Society, the governing body of Camp Tamiment, a successful workers resort which had long provided the majority of the School's budget. The collection contains correspondence, mostly of the chief executives of the school; minutes of the school's Educational Council; student term papers; internal memoranda on reorganization plans for the school; material relating to the school's publications, including Institute of Social Science Bulletin (1951-1955), including correspondence and manuscripts from contributors; course records; reports, monographs on topical issues, and transcripts of lectures and debates; the records of the school's Labor Research Department, which published American Labor Year Book from 1916-1932; records of American Labor Archive and Research Institute, founded in 1941 to preserve documents of the European and American labor movement; and financial and bookstore records.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Rand School of Social Science was undoubtedly one of the most important schools for workers and socialists in modern American history. Established in 1906 with funds from the will of Mrs. Carrie Rand and with the able leadership of George D. Herron, the Rand School provided working men and women with an opportunity to continue their education. Its governing body was the American Socialist Society (ASS), incorporated in 1901, whose purposes were "to...study and discuss social and political science and to expound the theories of modern socialism by lectures and publication." Board members of the ASS included Charles Beard, Morris Hillquit, Harry Laidler, Algernon Lee, John Spargo, and secretary W.J. Ghent. Over the next 50 years, a variety of Rand School courses on many contemporary topics, traditional subjects, and socialist theory were taught by intellectual leaders of the socialist movement, distinguished academicians, and trade union leaders.</p><p>During its early years from 1906 to 1922, the Rand School was supported by funds from the Socialist Party, the People's Educational Camp Society (Camp Tamiment), trade unions, the Workmen's Circle, the Jewish Forward Association, and the Rand School Bookstore. Most of the courses offered during this period pertained to socialist theory, economics, economic history, American history, literature, and other traditional subjects. Among the members of the Rand School faculty at this time were such luminaries as Scott Nearing, Charles Beard, James Harvey Robinson, Algernon Lee, and Bertha Howell Mailly.</p><p>By 1917 the Rand School had outgrown its original offices and classrooms in New York City's Greenwich Village and, in the fall of that year, purchased a six story building at 7 East 15th Street that had been vacated by the Young Women's Christian Association. This new building, named the "People's House" after a socialist center in Brussels, Belgium, had an auditorium, a library, spacious classrooms, and office space which was utilized by several socialist organizations as well as the Rand School staff. This building served as the headquarters of the Rand School until it closed in 1956.</p><p>The growth of the Rand School and the increased strength of the socialist movement contributed to the climate of anti-radical hysteria that prevailed in New York and other parts of the country following World War I. In 1919, the New York State Assembly appointed a special Committee investigate radical activities in the state, including the Rand School. Under the chairmanship of State Senator Clayton R. Lusk, this committee engaged in a campaign of harassment against the Rand School and its administrative board, the American Socialist Society. During the course of three years, the Lusk Committee conducted a raid on the Rand School offices, confiscated Rand School property, and attempted to close the school by court ordered injunction. Through a series of court cases in 1920 and 1922 (<emph render="italic">United States of America vs. American Socialist Society and Scott Nearing; The People of the State of New York vs. American Socialist Society</emph>), the Rand School was able to successfully counteract the Lusk Committee and retain control over its operations.</p><p>Following the debacle with the Lusk Committee, the Rand School entered into a period of expanded course offerings, special educational programs, and increased student enrollment. One of the most prevalent areas of expansion in the Rand School from the early 1920s until the mid-1940s was course offerings. During this period, the Rand School curriculum shifted from its parochial attachment to socialist instruction to a wide range of courses in the areas of child development, trade union policies, education, home economics, music, art, Russian studies, juvenile delinquency, race relations, peace education, propaganda and public opinion, psychology, public speaking, social work, supervision, and youth leadership. Some of the more notable instructors for these courses were Charles Beard, Franz Boas, Marc Connolly, Stephen Vincent Benet, Bertrand Russell, and August Claessens.</p><p>In addition to these expanded course offerings, the Rand School also provided many special educational programs. One of the most popular programs implemented by the Rand School was the correspondence courses. First organized prior to World War I, the correspondence course program was refined and expanded during the 1920s. Most of the course offerings pertained to socialist theory, but there were also courses in trade unionism, economics, social problems, and government. Another well attended special program was the Trade Union Institute. This program was first offered in the mid 1920s as the Workers' Training Course and later revised at the Trade Union Institute during the 1936-1937 academic year. The Institute offered courses in union organizing, contemporary labor problems, labor management relations, labor history, parliamentary procedure, and public speaking. During the 1940s and early 1950s, the Trade Union Institute was one of the most vital components of the Rand School curriculum.</p><p>When the Rand School was re-organized in the late 1930s, special education programs were offered for the first time in select professional areas of study. Some of these programs included review courses for the certified public accountant's examination, teacher in service credit courses and coaching courses, and courses for social workers and employment counselors. During this same period, the Rand School administration also established the following programs: (1) a Rand High School division which was designed to supplement the regular studies of high school students (1935-1936); (2) a political training course for members of the Social Democratic Federation and the American Labor Party (1937-1939); (3) the Newark School of Social Science which featured socialist, trade union, and contemporary issue courses and lectures for workers living in New Jersey (1937-1940); and (4) the Rand School in Northern New Jersey which superseded the Newark School and offered similar courses (1947-1949).</p><p>Besides its special education programs, the Rand School also sponsored numerous lectures, forums, and conferences on a variety of socialist and labor subjects. Some of the most interesting events of this nature were the 1931 forum on current events with Charles Edward Russell and Norman Thomas among the quest speakers; the 1932 United Youth Conference Against War; the 1941 symposium on America's role in World War II with Alfred Baker Lewis, August Claessens, and Gerhart Seger among the guest speakers; the 1941 conference on war aims and the postwar world with Alexander Kerensky, Matthew Woll, and Bertrand Russell among the guest speakers; the 1943 panel discussion on the validity of socialism with Sidney Hook, Max Eastman, and John Chamberlain among the guest speakers; and the 1944 lecture series on contemporary "prophets" with Max Ascoli, Mark Starr, Raphael Abramovitch, and Sidney Hook among the guest lecturers. As a means of helping to raise funds for the perpetually debt ridden institution, the Rand School staff also sponsored annual benefits at the metropolitan Opera House and produced occasional plays through the Rand Playhouse in the 1930s and the Labor Theatre in the early 1950s.</p><p>During its most active period, the Rand School operated a book store which contained many traditional and contemporary works on socialism, American and European labor, politics, sociology, and economics. The Rand School also maintained several research operations, including the Labor Research Department, the American Labor Archive and Research Institute, and the Institute of Social Studies. These research and information services published such works as <emph render="italic">The American Labor Year Book</emph> (1916-1932), <emph render="italic">The American Labor Who's Who</emph> (1925), the <emph render="italic">American Labor Press Directory</emph> (1925), and the <emph render="italic">Index to Labor Articles</emph> (1926-1953).</p><p>Another important adjunct of the activities of the Rand School was the library. Initially begun with gifts from students, teachers, alumni, and many socialist and labor supporters, the Meyer London Memorial Library (later known as the Tamiment Library), named after the famous New York City congressman, became well known for its manuscript collections, books, pamphlets, magazines, and newspapers pertaining to socialism, communism, and organized labor.</p><p>Shortly after World War II, the Rand School suffered a sharp decrease in both enrollment and course offerings. Recurring financial problems, the decline of American socialism in general, and the haunting specter of McCarthyism contributed significantly to this predicament. By the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Rand School offered only a few courses in addition to its relatively successful labor management relations program. Finally, in January 1956, the Board of Directors of the American Socialist Society closed the Rand School and transferred the title of the "People's House" to the People's Educational Camp Society (PECS), the governing body of Camp Tamiment, which had provided the bulk of the funding for the Rand School for many years. PECS reopened the  library in 1958 as the Tamiment Institute Library, under the auspices of the Tamiment Institute, the educational arm of Camp Tamiment. In 1963, Camp Tamiment, now a successful resort, lost its tax-exempt status as an educational institution, and the Library was donated to New York University as part of the settlement between PECS and the Internal Revenue Service.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Rand School of Social Science Records were transferred to New York University in 1963 by the People's Educational Camp Society (later renamed the Tamiment Institute), as part of a larger transfer of records of the  School and of organizations associated with the founding and maintenance of it (including the American Socialist Society, The Society of the Commonwealth Center, and the People's Educational Camp Society) as well as the contents of the School's library, the Meyer London Memorial Library.  The materials from this transfer were then separated into several different collections, one of which is the Rand School of Social Science Records.</p>  </custodhist>

Rand School Boards/Minutes (frames XIII:A:1-9), and 2. American Socialist Society (frames XIII:A:10-20). Included are several miscellaneous files, the papers of the Rand School Board of Directors, and the papers of the American Socialist Society which was the governing body of the Rand School.</p><p>The contents of each subject file have been arranged in chronological order, with undated items located at the end of the file. The miscellaneous files (XIII:A:1 XIII:A:4) include minutes, reports, and legal papers of the Rand School Society, Rand School Educational Council, Rand School Financial Committee, and the Rand Educational Institute. The Board of Directors' files (XIII:A:5 XIII:A:9) consist of correspondence, reports, memoranda, minutes, and resolutions. Of special interest in this section are the minutes of the Board of Directors' meetings (XIII:A:8). The minutes in this file contain important information pertaining to the decision making process of the Rand School administrative staff and the various policies implemented by the Board.</p><p>The bulk of the materials in this series relate to the American Socialist Society (XIII:A:10 XIII:A:20). It should be emphasized that the records of the American Socialist Society correspond with the items in the Board of Directors' files. The American Socialist Society records contain background papers, legal papers, correspondence, reports, minutes, annual meetings' papers, membership lists, and dues records.</p><p>The most interesting material in the American Socialist Society files are the papers relating to the three court cases and investigations involving the Society after World War I (XIII:A:11). Prominent among these cases is the Lusk Committee's investigation of the American Socialist Society in 1919 (XIII:A:lla). Some of the items included in this file are the resolution authorizing the investigation, a. "Statement of Facts" written by the Society, legal documents pertaining to the issuance of a search warrant, and an inventory of items seized in the committee raid on the Rand School. The court case files also include materials on the United States of America vs. American Socialist Society and Scott Nearing(XIII:A:llb) and  The People of the State of New York against American Socialist Society(XIII:A:llc).</p><p>The American Socialist Society correspondence files (XIII:A:12 - XIII:A:14) contain incoming and outgoing letters, letters relating to the Society's efforts to obtain tax exempt status, and mimeographed correspondence. Most of the correspondence relates to the routine operations of the Society, although there are several interesting letters which convey information about various Rand School policies. Among the significant correspondents in these files are Charles Beard, Morris Hillquit, Harry W. Laidler, Algernon Lee, John Spargo, and W. J. Ghent.</p><p>The American Socialist Society files also include extensive minutes (XIII:A:16) and papers relating to annual meetings (XIII:A:17). The minutes file contains valuable information about policies and events affecting the operations of the Rand School. It is recommended that these minutes as well as the American Socialist Society reports (XIII:A:15) be used in conjunction withthe Rand School Board of Directors' minutes. The annual meetings file contains correspondence and related papers of relatively minor importance. It should be pointed out that the papers pertaining to the annual meetings  also include a frame number designation for each year in the file. For example, the papers relating to the 1950 annual meeting will have the frame number, XIII:A:17:1950.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref14" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries IA: Rand School Boards/Minutes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1907/1956" type="inclusive">1907-1956</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_ref15" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Rand School Society Minutes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">May 6, 1907-Sep 13, 1907</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Most of the items in this series pertain to the period, 1930-1949, although there is correspondence covering the entire history of the Rand School. The correspondence is arranged in chronological order, with undated items located at the end of the series. Much of the correspondence reflects such routine matters as handling inquiries about course offerings or teaching positions, mailing invitations to guest speakers, making arrangements for courses and lectures, and sponsoring  fund raising events. Besides these items, there are several letters which discuss the Lusk Committee's investigation of the Rand School, unemployment during the Depression, the Socialist Party split in the mid 1930s, and the affairs of the  New Leader. Most of the correspondence is from the executive offices of the Rand School, particularly from Algernon Lee, Bertha H. Mailly, William E. Bohn, John L. Afros, and Theodore Schapiro. Other correspondents with letters of more than routine interest are Norman Thomas, Upton Sinclair, Charles Edward Russell, John M. Work, J. Mahlon Barnes, Clarence Senior, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and William C. Duffy.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref205" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>General Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1913/1920" type="inclusive">1913-1920</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

For each file in which those types of materials are found, the course records precede the correspondence in the filming order. All correspondence in these files is chronologically arranged and pertains to such matters as obtaining faculty members and scheduling courses in the School's curriculum for a particular semester. Among the more interesting items in this part are the papers relating to correspondence courses (XIII:C:9), teacher in service courses (XIII:C:18 XIII:C:19), juvenile delinquency courses (XIII:C:23XIII:C:24), the Newark School of Social Science (XIII:C:31), peace education (XIII:C:34), propaganda courses (XIII:C:38 XIII:C:39), the Rand High School (XIII:C:45), the Rand School in Northern New Jersey (XIII:C:46), teacher coaching courses (XIII:C:58 XIII:C:65), the Trade Union Institute (XIII:C:66 XIII:C:69), women's afternoon classes (XIII:C:74 XIII:C:76), and the Workers' Training Course (XIII:C:77XIII:C:78).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref819" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Course Announcements and Outlines</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1905/1962" type="inclusive">1925-Fall 1931, undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

These files have been arranged in chronological order, with undated items placed at the end of the section. Among the most interesting items in this part are an address by Bertrand Russell on post World War I Europe (XIII:C:109), a lecture by Stuart Chase on the rationalization of industry (XII:C:111), five lectures by Morris Hillquit on international socialism (XIII:C:112), a debate between Harry Elmer Barnes and Algernon Lee on the question of whether the United States should become involved in an anti-fascist war (XIII:C:123), a lecture by Sidney Hook on Marx and Engels (XIII:C:126), and a lecture by Bertram D. Wolfe on Trotsky and Stalin (XIII:C:129). In this part are also transcripts of five "Round Table Discussions" which were sponsored by the Rand school in 1945 (XIII:C:138 XIII:C:142). These discussions, which centered upon a variety of contemporary political topics, featured such prominent figures as Sidney Hook, Bertram D. Wolfe, David J. Dallin, Henry Pratt Fairchild, A. Philip Randolph, and Irving Fisher. A full bibliographical citation for each item in this part can be found in the complete reel list for this collection.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1091" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Shall the Policy of the United States Toward Russia Be Changed", a debate between Sen.

The papers within these files are arranged in chronological order, with undated items placed at the end of the file. The two most interesting files in this part are those of the Labor Research Department and the American Labor Archive and Research Institute. The Labor Research Department file contains numerous reports on American labor issues and the Department's operations. The correspondence in this file primarily consists of reviews of The American Labor Year Book. Among the principal correspondents in this file are Alexander Trachtenberg, Feliks Gross, Harry W. Laidler, Solon De Leon, Max Nomad, Mark Starr, Upton Sinclair, and James Oneal.</p><p>The American Labor Archive and Research Institute was established in 1941 for the purpose of preserving documents which related to the European and American labor movements. The correspondence in the American Labor Archive file pertains to the activities of the Archive's director, Boris Nicolaevsky. There is also an interesting report in this file entitled, "Jewish Problems in the American Trade Union Press, 1944-1945." This report was prepared by the American Labor Archive staff for the Jewish Labor Committee</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1402" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Labor Research Department</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Dec 31, 1912-[1933], undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_ab5e0e7e6362e131b135ead0f35b1a0f" label="Mixed Materials [31142063145216]" type="Box">47</container><container id="aspace_4214667090af99e038cc6641612ea478" parent="aspace_ab5e0e7e6362e131b135ead0f35b1a0f" type="Folder">8</container></did><odd id="aspace_f070ccfa2e3e80c94fdcaef1278d59e4"><head>General note</head><p>Film R-7124, Reel 49: Frame XIII:F:1:1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_ref1404" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>American Labor Archive and Research Institute</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1931/1951" type="inclusive">ca.1941-Feb 16, 1951</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_0bca32e14113bdcda9f32a7894c29e56" label="Mixed Materials [31142063145216]" type="Box">47</container><container id="aspace_0036f639edf2f56954392e73fc98e27c" parent="aspace_0bca32e14113bdcda9f32a7894c29e56" type="Folder">9</container></did><odd id="aspace_a15423dd0e23e890cf5afd045e9b1311"><head>General note</head><p>Film R-7124, Reel 49: Frame XIII:F:1:2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_ref1406" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Institute of Social Studies</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Jan 3, 1950-1952</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_0043b31a3f14c29fb4e515f7b156261b" label="Mixed Materials [31142063145216]" type="Box">47</container><container id="aspace_619992ded95e5b7a269a40e2caa04084" parent="aspace_0043b31a3f14c29fb4e515f7b156261b" type="Folder">10</container></did><odd id="aspace_6018056a7f62d6ae824984cce2c97742"><head>General note</head><p>Film R-7124, Reel 49: Frame XIII:F:1:3</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_ref1408" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Institute of Social Studies</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1905/1965" type="inclusive">ca.1953-1955, undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_e3f7104e7b4bceacea8635397ec3d985" label="Mixed Materials [31142063145224]" type="Box">48</container><container id="aspace_86ba0346a49b3c72b546cfc9705915a3" parent="aspace_e3f7104e7b4bceacea8635397ec3d985" type="Folder">1</container></did><odd id="aspace_bb4a5f391ee441ce951d8cf9d327b0ef"><head>General note</head><p>Film R-7124, Reel 49: Frame XIII:F:1:3</p></odd></c></c><c id="aspace_ref1410" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries VIB: Pamphlets and Books, 1914-1954</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1914/1954" type="inclusive">1914-1954</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_115cace1906e9617e03f5c56e358cf20"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>The pamphlets and books part of the publications series consists of 83 pamphlets and one book. These items are arranged in alphabetical order according to the author's last name or the title of the publication. Some of the topics discussed in the pamphlets include the Taft Hartley Law, the Lusk Committee's investigation of the Rand School, socialist theory, race prejudice, the objectives of organized labor, the New York City socialist aldermen, the Seabury investigation, public ownership, the Moscow Trials, the rise of totalitarian regimes in the 1930s, the Russian Revolution, militarism, the American Labor Party, the Austrian Civil War, and the "Popular Front" issue. Many of these pamphlets were written by such prominent figures as David P. Berenberg, August Claessens, Evans Clark, Max Eastman, James T. Farrell, Morris Hillquit, Herbert Morrison, Scott Nearing, James Oneal, and August Tyler. The only book in this part is The American Labor Who's Who which was edited by Solon De Leon in 1925 (XIII:F:2:27). This reference work, which was published under the auspices of the Labor Research Department, is a compilation of brief biographical sketches of prominent American labor leaders in the post-World War I era. A full bibliographical citation for each item in this part is located in the complete reel list for this collection.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1411" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Adler, Friedrich. <title render="italic">Democracy and Revolution</title>.

Originally entitled the  Index to Labor Periodicals, this publication was prepared by the staff of the Rand School's Meyer London Memorial Library from December 1926 to October 1953. In each issue of the  Index, there are numerous citations for articles pertaining to the American and international labor movements. It is interesting to note that many of these citations were drawn from various labor, progressive, and radical periodicals which standard reference sources, such as The Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, neglected to cite. The  Index to Labor Articles is arranged in chronological order and is complete except for three issues. It should be noted that the editor attempted to locate these missing items at other repositories, but was unable to find them. A full bibliographical citation for each volume of the  Index is located in the complete reel list for this collection.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1607" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">Index to Labor Articles</title>, v. 1, no. 1</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Dec 1926</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

The ephemeral printed matter is arranged in chronological order and includes commemorative booklets, circular letters, programs, announcements, flyers, brochures, handbills, leaflets, and postcards. Some of the most interesting items in this part are the programs for the Rand School Ball of 1920, 1921, and 1922; ten leaflets relating to a series of political talks given by Scott Nearing before the Rand School's Current History class in 1924; a leaflet for Charles Beard's 1930-1931 symposium entitled, "American Civilization Today"; announcements for the Metropolitan opera and Broadway show benefits; and two booklets commemorating the 40th and 45th anniversaries of the Rand School. The press releases are also arranged in chronological order, with undated items placed at the end of the file. Most of the press releases contain general information about the Rand School as well as announcements of lectures and special events. There are also several speeches in this part which were given by Rand School faculty members and quest lecturers.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2606" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Press Releases</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Sep 1926-Nov 1955,</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
