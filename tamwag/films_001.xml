Wagner Labor Archives. It includes the film archives of the Transport Workers Union of America, a labor union founded in 1934 to organize subway workers and bus drivers in the New York City area that later included taxi drivers, railway employees, airline workers and utility workers in locals across the country; films and film footage from District 65/UAW , another labor union formed in New York City (in 1933) that organized warehouse workers, later expanding to include workers from the retail and manufacturing sectors, clerical personnel, salesclerks, writers, editors, technicians, and lawyers, include large numbers of women; a complete film, <emph render="italic">Nos Maisons d'Enfants</emph>, from the Jewish Labor Committee, a New York-based umbrella group of Jewish or Jewish-led trade unions and fraternal organizations, founded in 1934 to organize anti-Nazi and anti-fascist activity and to provide assistance to European Jews and others persecuted by these movements; footage shot by still photographer John Albok (1894-1982), known for his images of children and New York City street life during the Depression, who also documented organized labor and left-radical political life in New York City; and early footage of Camp Tamiment, a summer resort for socialists, in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, that opened in 1921. The remainder of the materials in the Collection come from various other labor and radical organizations. Together, they comprise approximately 40 hours of black and white and color 16mm motion picture film (and one 35mm film) which have been transferred to video for research use. They document activities and history of the labor movement and radical left or progressive organizations, mostly in New York City (although Philadelphia, Barcelona, Geneva, and a few locations in France are also represented. Most were produced by or for labor, left or progressive organizations and associated individuals in the United States. The Collection includes a dozen documentary films and a similar number each of television programs and filmed press conferences, but the largest proportion of materials by far consists of outtakes and edited sequences from these productions; a small amount of stock footage shot, acquired for, or associated with, these productions and unedited footage not associated with them.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Tamiment/Wagner Moving Images Collection represents the core motion picture film collection of the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University. A description of the four main creators/subject areas of footage follows.</p><p>The Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) was founded in New York City in 1934 by subway workers. Affiliating with the fledgling CIO, it soon became the bargaining agent for all New York City bus and subway systems, and branched out to form locals across the country. By the early 1950s the union's membership had grown to over 100,000, in both public and privately-owned transit lines. By the 1960s, TWU locals were also established among railroad, airlines, and utility workers and taxi drivers. Politically progressive, it actively supported equal rights for African-Americans long before the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Its principal and eventually successful struggle in the decade or so following World War II was to win a five-day, forty-hour week for its members. Its New York Local 100 has always been the largest and most influential in the union.</p><p>The TWU's founders were mostly Irish immigrants who came to the United States after the Irish rebellion of 1916. Among them was Michael J. Quill (1905-1966), a Kerry native and subway ticket clerk who led early organizing efforts for the TWU, and became its president, a position he held for the first thirty years of the union's existence. Quill's leadership abilities and public persona quickly spread his influence beyond his own union to make him a key player in the broader labor and political arenas in New York and nationally. He was elected to two terms on New York's City Council, on the American Labor Party ticket, was the chairman of the City's CIO Council, and later served as a vice president on the AFL-CIO's executive council.</p><p>From its early days the TWU made aggressive use of public relations to communicate with its members as well as the general public, and to keep its fingers on the pulse of public opinion: it tape-recorded important meetings, it produced hundreds of radio advertisements for itself and its political allies, as well as live radio broadcasts. And it used moving images as well. It filmed union soapbox speakers and rallies and Michael Quill's election campaign rallies in the 1930; it documented TWU field days and victory rallies during World War II. In 1941 the union produced its first film documentary, the half-hour, <emph render="italic">United We Are Invincible</emph>(aka <emph render="italic">United We Strike</emph>, aka <emph render="italic">The Great Bus Strike of 1941</emph>), which told the story of the union's strike against New York City bus lines. This was followed by several other documentaries commissioned by the union. The TWU also enthusiastically embraced the new medium of television in early 1951, when it launched what was to be the first of hundreds of television programs and filmed press releases produced by the union (a small selection is included in this Collection). Most of these were made by professional filmmakers and producers, including Paul Miner, Tom Costigan, and Workers Film and Photograph League member, Leo Seltzer.</p><p>The labor union later known as District 65, UAW, was organized in New York City in 1933 by Arthur Osman. In 1938 it became Local 65 of the United Retail and Wholesale Employees of America, CIO. Though at first composed primarily of male, Jewish warehouse workers, the union expanded to include members of varied ethnic backgrounds from the retail and manufacturing sectors, clerical personnel, salesclerks, writers, editors, technicians, and lawyers, and it came to include large numbers of women. The union was characterized by democratic, rank and file rule, and an activist progressive political agenda that included early and active support for the civil rights movement.</p><p>The Jewish Labor Committee, an umbrella group of Jewish or Jewish-led trade unions and fraternal organizations, was founded in New York City in 1934. Its primary purposes were to organize anti-Nazi and anti-fascist activity and to provide assistance to European Jews and others persecuted by these movements. During World War II it maintained close ties with European resistance movements and was able to effect the rescue of hundreds of labor and socialist activists and their families. After the War, it assisted and resettled survivors and helped to reunite families, and became active in civil rights and labor rights campaigns in the United States and human rights work world wide.</p><p>John Albok (1894-1982), who immigrated to the United States from Hungary in 1921, and opened a tailor shop to support himself and his family, was also a still photographer known for his sensitive depiction of Central Park, children, and New York City street life from the Depression through the 1960s; he also photographed images of trade-union and leftwing political protest and culture during this same period. He occasionally documented the same subjects in moving images, using 16mm black and white and color film.</p><p>Camp Tamiment, a summer resort for socialists, their families and friends, near Bushkill, Pennsylvania, opened in 1921. Its initial purpose was to serve as a summer retreat for faculty, students, and friends of the Rand School of Social Science (a school for workers in New York City that was closely allied with the Socialist Party) and to provide a reliable source of revenue to support the School. The Camp was also home to the Tamiment Playhouse, a major creative outlet for theater, dance, film, and television in the United States, nurturing major entertainment figures such as Max Liebman, Jerome Robbins and Danny Kaye.</p><p>Sources:

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection is comprised of approximately 40 hours of motion picture film, comprising 193 separate segments that document the activities and history of the labor movement and left or progressive organizations, mostly in New York City (although Philadelphia, Barcelona, Geneva, and a few locations in France are also represented/depicted/included). It consists, with a single exception, entirely of 16mm film—primarily in black and white, but with a significant amount in color--and of the 51 videotapes to which these film materials were transferred, to create surrogates to allow screening while protecting the originals. Almost all of the materials in the collection were produced by and/or for labor, left, or progressive organizations or associated individuals in the United States. About a dozen documentary films, a similar number of television programs (kinescopes), and a dozen and a half filmed press conferences form the core of the Collection, but a larger proportion consists of outtakes and edited sequences from these productions, as well as a unedited footage and a small amount of stock footage shot, acquired for, or associated with, these productions.</p><p>The largest share of the materials in the Collection (84% --168 of the 193 segments) is the film archive of the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) -- a national, New York City-based labor union whose members are mainly bus and subway workers. The TWU materials stretch from the 1930s through 1967 and document the union's own activities as well as of some of its friends and allies, including mass meetings, conventions, speeches, negotiation sessions, picket lines, demonstrations, parades and press conferences. It is also notable in illustrating the TWU's pioneering embrace of television as a public relations tool for trade unions. The remainder of the Collection--the non-TWU footage—while it represents a much smaller amount, is more eclectic and international in scope. It includes footage ranging from the 1920s through the 1960s documenting organizations or individuals associated with the three main strands of left-radical politics and culture: Communism, Socialism, and anarchism, as well as footage of, or produced by, other labor organizations, both U.S. and foreign. Also represented are New York City May Day parades in color and black and white, New York City and state politicians, and the daily life of poor, homeless, and working-class children and adults in New York City during the depths of the Depression, as well as such occasional random surprises as a shot of the dirigible Hindenberg flying above Madison Avenue on the day it later crashed and burned.
 
While the footage in this Collection documents events and activities specific to labor history and radical and progressive movements, it also documents topics unrelated to these. A wide range of activities, locations, occupations, subjects, attitudes and emotions was incidentally captured, in addition to the intended themes. For example, the same footage that documents union activities in New York City in the 1930s shows street scenes in working-class neighborhoods in Manhattan and other boroughs that are seldom seen in moving images; while picket lines snake around the block and soap-boxers inveigh, in the background and foreground everyday life goes on; in front of tenements and brownstone stoops, children frolic and parents push baby carriages, and a horse-drawn cart and a bicycles ride through the frame (in some of these scenes exact locations are even thoughtfully provided—because the addresses appear on the signs carried by union members picketing in front of the homes of more than a dozen individual TWU members who have "deserted" the union). Similarly, a panoply of the feet and shoes (only) of ordinary New Yorkers on Fifth Avenue can be seen as part of a sequence whose purpose was to illustrate the effectiveness of a 1950s transit strike by showing the public walking instead of riding public transport. These unintentionally-recorded, usually fragmentary, documents of social history can be of particular value because they are candid and unposed, in contrast to the staged official activities which were shot to document and promote the activities of the organizations that commissioned them. Other "unintended documents" in the Collection include footage of public meeting places such as hotels and auditoriums; office, restaurant, and workplace interiors; mass transit, including subway trains and buses, subway and bus passengers, train stations and an airport; power plants and industrial equipment; the deserted waterfront of a New Jersey port; the changing streetscapes and neighborhoods of New York City, as well as some of its landmarks (the interior of the old Pennsylvania Railroad Station and its clock, New York Public Library, and St. Patrick's Cathedral, Coney Island's Cyclone rollercoaster, and facades of businesses such as a Horn and Hardart Automat, and the Peck and Peck women's clothing store); track and field events, team sports recreation and resorts; parades and marching bands; voting; social dancing; stenographers, shoe shiners, television camera operators, reporters, police, waiters, musicians and teachers at work. Also: racially-integrated social and organizational gatherings in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s; rhetorical styles and oratory of politicians and union leaders; demeanor and dress of ordinary middle-class and working-class Americans in the mid-twentieth century; and performance styles on early public affairs television programs.</p><p>Each film segment described in the container list below has been assigned a unique Tape # and Tape Hour # (T# and H#). These T# / H#'s can be found in the container list. All segment titles have been supplied by archives staff except those in italics, which are the original titles given by the film's creator(s). Please note that running times for segments are approximate only, not exact. The container list consists of brief descriptions of each segment that includes a title, the location where the segment was shot, whether it is black and white or color, whether it has sound or is silent, footage type (these include complete film, part of film, filmed press releases, and "footage," by which is meant edited sequences, outtakes or unedited footage -- or combinations of these), date and approximate total running time; it can be used to browse the entire contents of the Collection. For more information on any individual segment, more detailed descriptions are available, including shot-by-shot descriptions of the contents with "in and out points" for each shot (e.g., showing approximately where a shot in the segment begins and ends), and for whom or what entity the segment was produced.

  <dsc><c id="aspace_ref15" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series I: Transport Workers Union of America, 1930-1967</unittitle><langmaterial><language langcode="eng" scriptcode="Latn">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_247d884660bfca0c55bed4981a12b598"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Most materials in this series focus on Local 100, the TWU's New York City local representing bus and subway workers, but also included are segments concerning the international union and its Railroad and Air Transport divisions, as well as Locals 101 (Brooklyn Union Gas utility workers) and 234 (Philadelphia transit workers). They are drawn from the following materials, all produced by or for the union: seven documentaries, <emph render="italic">United We Are Invincible</emph>(1941) ; <emph render="italic">Our Case For The Forty-Hour Week</emph>(1950), <emph render="italic">The Transport Workers Union of America, CIO, Presents Proceedings Of Its Seventh Biennial Convention</emph>(1950), <emph render="italic">Memorial Tribute To Mr. CIO—Allan S. Haywood</emph>(1953); <emph render="italic">Twenty-Nine Days To Victory</emph>(1953), <emph render="italic">Years Of Challenge</emph>(1961), and <emph render="italic">The Best Is Yet To Come</emph>(1967), as well as programs, press conferences, and filmed press releases broadcast on television (including national conventions and locals' mass meetings, officers' reports to locals and national divisions, and reports to the public on its actions). The largest number of segments consist outtakes from the completed films and television program, as well as unedited footage.</p><p>The films in this series include many hours of footage of the TWU's ebullient, truculent, theatrical and colorful long-time president, Michael J. Quill. These present a visual record of his life and career, from young and sprightly in the 1930s (including a rally during his successful 1939 campaign to be elected to the New York City Council) to aging and ill, being jailed during the disastrous 1966 New York City transit strike, and, only weeks later, his funeral cortege emerging from New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral, and including glimpses of his family, his son, John Quill, as well as his wives, Mollie (O'Neill) Quill and Shirley (Garry) Quill. Quill's fiery oratory, sharp tongue, shrewd wit, and agile repartee is on display here, including his trademark threat, that the union would stay on the picket line "until the plains of hell itself freeze over"; his calling one of New York City's mayors "a plain, ordinary, common liar"; and many instances of his rhetorically skewering his opponents (in management, in politics, and within his own union) in person and in the media. The series also includes other TWU officers and staff, including: Eugene Attreed, Gustav Faber, Maurice Forge, Daniel Gilmartin, William Grogan, Matthew Guinan, Austin Hogan, James Horst, Andrew Kaelin, Mark Kavanaugh, Matthew Kearns, Douglas MacMahon, Frank O'Connor, John O'Donnell, Harry Sacher, John Santo, James Shannon, Frank Sheehan, and Ellis Van Riper.</p><p>TWU footage also includes prominent leaders of other unions and national labor organizations, such as the CIO's John L. Lewis, Philip Murray and Allan Haywood, the AFL-CIO's George Meany, Joseph Curran of the National Maritime Union, David J. MacDonald of the United Steel Workers, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters' James R. Hoffa (who can be seen promising not to raid TWU locals); officials of New York City and State AFL-CIO councils, including Raymond Diana, Louis Hollander, Morris Iushewitz, Martin Lacey, and Harry Van Arsdale, Jr. Other labor-related figures represented include Arthur Goldberg, a labor lawyer whose clients included the TWU before he became United States Secretary of Labor and later a United States Supreme Court Justice; noted labor arbitrator, Theodore Kheel; labor negotiator, Julius Manson and "labor priest," Father Charles Owen Rice of Pittsburgh. Politicians and officials are represented, too: New York City mayors Fiorello LaGuardia and Robert F. Wagner, Jr.; New York City Transit Authority commissioners John J. Gilhooley and Joseph E. O' Grady, and Philadelphia mayors Joseph S. Clark, Jr., Richardson Dilworth, and James Hugh Joseph Tate. Also worth noting are persons who are not on-screen, but are mentioned, usually with invective. Rudolph Halley, president of the New York City Council, New York City mayor Vincent Impellitteri, New York City Comptroller Lawrence E. Gerosa, New York State governor Thomas E. Dewey, and anti-union, anti-communist lawyer Roy Cohn, all get their share of this treatment.</p><p>Other footage includes mass meetings, rallies, demonstrations, Labor Day parades (which document other unions' contingents as well as the TWU's), contract negotiations, press conferences, picket lines, strikes, and speeches, beginning with the early days of the TWU in the 1930s and 1940s (including its attendance at a 1943 national CIO convention); TWU participation in World War II "United Front" activities such as a huge 1942 "Defend America" rally, with US and Soviet flags side by side on the podium and buses bearing slogans like, "Uncle Sam Won't Miss the Bus—Lick Hitler in 1942; and the expulsion of Communist Party members from the union six years later. Also shown are members at work: bus drivers, subway conductors and motormen, utility workers, baggage handlers and airplane maintenance mechanics, flight attendants, railroad train maintenance workers, and gas utility workers. The ethnic makeup of TWU's officers and members, many of them of Irish extraction, is reflected in footage of TWU officers and members participating in New York City's annual St. Patrick's Day parade; footage of members and officers of other ethnic groups, including African-American officers such as Herman C. Gray, Louis Manning, Edward T. Williamson, and rank and file members in the audience at mass meetings.</p><p>Also among these materials are: a long speech given by Michael Quill at the union's 30th anniversary meeting in 1964, in which he discusses the TWU's and his relationship with the Communist Party, as well as what may be the earliest footage of an attempted corporate takeover and proxy fight, as Quill and the TWU went toe-to-toe over the management of the Fifth Avenue Bus Company – represented by Lawrence Weissman, Harry Weinberg, and Roy Cohn -- in 1962. (This sequence includes candid footage in which some participants are clearly not aware of being filmed.) And while there is no footage directly showing dissidents against the TWU's entrenched leadership, documentation of these groups and individuals is not entirely absent. It is manifested in Quill's shouting down union dissidents from the podium, in his direct as well as oblique (uncomplimentary) references to them at mass meetings, and in his testy response to questions from reporters about wildcat strikes within the union; and it can be heard in occasional catcalls from the TWU convention floor.</p><p>The series also includes informal and candid scenes of working-class social life of the 1940s and 50s, for example, color footage of union officers and members with spouses and children, dressed in their Sunday best, attending an annual "Field Day" in Croke Park in the Bronx; the union's "11th annual outing," replete with drum and bagpipe bands, pony rides, clowns, hotdogs, beer, ice cream, and competitive athletic events such as softball, soccer, high jump, horse shoes, shot put, foot races; footage of a racially integrated holiday party showing adults smoking and drinking; and a banquet celebration.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref16" level="file"><did><unittitle>Exterior of bus company garage; 1930s street scenes in New York City boroughs; Transport Workers Union elections?
