    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Moving Images Collection contains film and video documenting organized labor and leftist movements in the United States from the 1930s-1970s, as well as recordings of Tamiment Library events in the 1980s-1990s.</p><p>The majority of the collection is film and video recordings that document the Transport Workers Union of America's activities between 1930-1970. The Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) was founded in New York City in 1934 by subway workers. Michael J. Quill (1905-1966), a Kerry native and subway ticket clerk, led early organizing efforts for the TWU and became its first president. It soon became the bargaining agent for all New York City bus and subway systems, and branched out to form locals across the country. By the early 1950s, the Union's membership had grown to over 100,000, in both public and privately-owned transit lines. By the 1960s, TWU locals were also established among railroad, airlines, and utility workers and taxi drivers.  From its early days, the TWU made use of radio, film, and television to communicate with its members as well as the general public. Most of the Union's programs were made by professional filmmakers and producers, including Paul Miner, Tom Costigan, and Leo Seltzer.</p><p>This collection also contains works by several other labor and leftist organizations. The Jewish Labor Committee, an umbrella group of Jewish or Jewish-led trade unions and fraternal organizations, was founded in New York City in 1934. Its primary purposes were to organize anti-Nazi and anti-fascist activity and to provide assistance to European Jews and others persecuted by these movements. During World War II, it maintained close ties with European resistance movements and was able to effect the rescue of hundreds of labor and socialist activists and their families. After the War, it assisted and resettled survivors and helped to reunite families, and became active in civil rights and labor rights campaigns in the United States and human rights work world wide.</p><p>The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) is the largest federation of unions in the United States, made up of 60 unions and representing more than 12 million workers. It was formed in 1955 when AFL and CIO merged. The federation's Committee on Political Education (COPE) was established shortly after the merger in 1955, itself a combination of the CIO's Political Action Committee and AFL's Labor League for Political Education. COPE activities have included political research, grassroots voter mobilization efforts, candidate endorsements, and advocacy for issues affecting workers' rights. COPE is now decentralized and local chapters are active across the country.</p><p>This collection also includes works by individual filmmakers who documented labor and leftist history in the United States. John Albok (1894-1982) was a still photographer and filmmaker known for his depiction of New York City street life from the Depression through the 1960s, as well as trade-union and leftwing political protest and culture during this same period. Louis W. Kellman's film <emph render="italic">Tales From Tamiment</emph> depicts Camp Tamiment, a summer resort for socialists near Bushkill, Pennsylvania, that opened in 1921. Initially tied to the Rand School of Social Science, it also later became home to the Tamiment Playhouse.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>Albok, John. <emph render="italic">John Albok: For the Children.</emph> Dallas, Texas: Photographic Archives Gallery, 1995.</p><p>Huberman, Leo. <emph render="italic">The Great Bus Strike.</emph>New York: Modern Age Books, 1941.</p><p>Freeman, Joshua. <emph render="italic">In Transit</emph> (New York, Oxford University Press, 1989).</p><p><emph render="italic">John Albok, 1894-1982: Through the Eye of the Needle.</emph> Budapest: Hungarian Multicultural Center, Inc., 1998.</p><p>LoMonaco, Martha. <emph render="italic">Every Week, a Broadway Revue: The Tamiment Playhouse, 1921-1960.</emph>New York: Greenwood Press, 1992.</p><p>Malmgreen, Gail.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Moving Images Collection contains film and video documenting organized labor and leftist movements in the United States, as well as recordings of Tamiment Library events in the 1980s-1990s. </p><p>Series I. Transport Workers Union of America Films (1930-1977) includes original films and video transfers of the Transport Workers Union of America's activities between 1930 and 1970, which make up a majority of the collection. These films include prints, elements, and trims from the films <emph render="italic">United We are Invincible</emph> (1941), <emph render="italic">Our Case for the Forty-Hour Work Week</emph> (1950), <emph render="italic">Memorial Tribute to Mr. CIO – Allan S. Haywood</emph> (1953), <emph render="italic">Twenty-Nine Days to Victory</emph> (1953), <emph render="italic">Years of Challenge</emph> (1961), and <emph render="italic">The Best is Yet to Come</emph> (1967). Other Transport Workers Union films contain footage of conferences, press releases, mass meetings, negotiations, demonstrations, campaign speeches, and parades. Materials in this series focus mostly on the activities of Local 100 (New York City bus and subway workers), Local 101 (Brooklyn Union Gas utility workers), and Local 234 (Philadelphia transit workers). TWU figures frequently represented in these materials include Union President Michael Quill, Union President Matthew Guinan, Union Vice President Frank Sheehan, CIO Director Allan Haywood, and Local 100 President Ellis Van Riper. Former New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. is also depicted giving campaign speeches to the Union.</p><p>Series II. Films on Organized Labor and the Political Left (1925-2005) includes programs and event recordings produced and distributed by labor and leftist organizations, mainly on the topics of socialism, communism, civil rights, and labor organizing.

Together with the TWU materials in Series I., these films provide insight into the history of labor and leftist movements in the U.S., as well as a candid portrayal of New York City life during the 1930s-1960s.</p><p>Series III. Tamiment Library Event Recordings (1979-2003) contains videos of events organized by Tamiment Library, which celebrated figures and explored topics related to the film subjects in Series I. and II.

Transport Workers Union of America Films (1930-1977) includes original films and video transfers of the Transport Workers Union of America's activities between 1930 and 1970, which make up a majority of the collection. The films in Subseries I.A. include prints, elements, and trims from the films <emph render="italic">United We are Invincible</emph> (1941), <emph render="italic">Our Case for the Forty-Hour Work Week</emph> (1950), <emph render="italic">Memorial Tribute to Mr. CIO – Allan S. Haywood</emph> (1953), <emph render="italic">Twenty-Nine Days to Victory</emph> (1953), <emph render="italic">Years of Challenge</emph> (1961), and <emph render="italic">The Best is Yet to Come</emph> (1967).

Video reproductions in Subseries I.B. are compilations containing transfers and excerpts of the films in Subseries I.A. </p><p>Materials in this series focus mostly on the activities of Local 100 (New York City bus and subway workers), Local 101 (Brooklyn Union Gas utility workers), and Local 234 (Philadelphia transit workers). TWU figures frequently represented in these materials include Union President Michael Quill, Union President Matthew Guinan, Union Vice President Frank Sheehan, CIO Director Allan Haywood, and Local 100 President Ellis Van Riper. Former New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. is also depicted giving campaign speeches to the Union.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_e8ba0db43d0cbfa1df101c4f5e1a9d11"><head>Historical Note</head><p>The Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) was founded in New York City in 1934 by subway workers. It soon became the bargaining agent for all New York City bus and subway systems, and branched out to form locals across the country. By the early 1950s, the Union's membership had grown to over 100,000 and included members from both public and privately-owned transit lines. By the 1960s, TWU locals were also established among railroad, airlines, utility workers, and taxi drivers. The TWU actively supported equal rights for Black Americans. In the decade following World War II, it fought for a five-day, forty-hour week for its members. </p><p>Many of the TWU's founders were Irish immigrants who came to the United States after the Easter Rising of 1916. Among them was Michael J. Quill (1905-1966), a Kerry native and subway ticket clerk who led early organizing efforts for the TWU and became its first president. He was elected to two terms on New York's City Council, was the chairman of the City's CIO Council, and later served as a vice president on the AFL-CIO's executive council.</p><p>From its early days, the TWU made use of radio and moving images to communicate with its members and the general public. It recorded important meetings, produced hundreds of radio advertisements, filmed Union soapbox speakers and rallies, and documented TWU field days and victory rallies during World War II. In 1941, the Union produced its first film, <emph render="italic">United We Are Invincible</emph>, which told the story of the union's strike against New York City bus lines. This was followed by several other films commissioned by the Union. The TWU also embraced the new medium of television in early 1951, when it launched its first television program. Most of the Union's programs were made by professional filmmakers and producers, including Paul Miner, Tom Costigan, and Leo Seltzer.</p></bioghist><c id="aspace_b27460c1d54b2fe560e6fae9484e2d1e" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries I.A.
