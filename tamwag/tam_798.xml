    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The NYC COVID-19 Web Activism Collection documents activists' use of social media and the internet to create content, online campaigns, online actions, virtual mutual aid networks and funds to highlight, resist, and call attention to ways in which COVID-19 has impacted New York City physically, emotionally, politically, and economically. This collection also focused on the ways in which this activism names and addresses the ways in which COVID-19 has disproportionately affected low income communities of color in New York City. Subjects covered within the scope of this collection include organizing around tenants rights and rent strikes; housing insecurity; decarceration campaigns and efforts to raise bail for incarcerated individuals (especially those facing COVID-19 outbreaks in New York City jails); efforts to confront and combat anti-Asian racism; demilitarization campaigns; efforts to confront and combat environmental racism; organizing around access to healthcare; neighborhood autonomy and agency; and support and organizing for workers who are striking against unsafe work conditions, lack of hazard pay, and/or lack of benefits. This is an artificial collection, materials were selected by Tamiment curators and arranged by an archivist.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>In May 2020, Tamiment curators Shannon O'Neill and Michael Koncewicz selected websites on New York City activism related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The collection was maintained by Nicole Greenhouse. Maintenance of the collection consisted of rescoping due to missing captured content, redirects and content drift, missing embedded materials (such as videos or attached Google documents and pdfs), and other materials created by selected entities that is related to the pandemic. The finding aid was created in Spring 2022 and description was standardized across the collection. </p><p>In summer 2023, links from the resources page on the Zip Code Memory Project were added to the collection. </p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In March 2020, non-essential businesses throughout New York City closed in an effort to contain COVID-19, a respiratory virus that first identified in December 2019. The virus and the closures disproportionally affected systematically excluded groups. Within days of the shutdown, activists began to organize to provide mutual aid and information about the COVID-19 to support sex workers, veterans, immigrants, LGBTQIA people, incarcerated people, workers, and others. Over the course of the pandemic, these individuals and organizations pushed for worker protections, housing and tenant relief, decarceration, and called attention to ways in which COVID-19 has impacted New York City physically, emotionally, politically, and economically. During the pandemic, George Floyd, a black man, was killed by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, in May 2020. This led to protests calling for the abolishment of the police and a resurgence in the Black Lives Matter movement. As the pandemic continued into 2021 and 2022, pushes for a "return to normal" by the establishment and government--despite continued resurgences in COVID-19 cases and deaths--led to activists pushing for rent assistance, an eviction moratorium, vaccine mandates, masking, ventilation and other environmental concerns, unionization efforts, city budget reforms, safe staffing for healthcare workers, and more permanent actions to keep people safe and healthy. As of this writing in April 2022, the pandemic is still an active part of life.</p>  </bioghist>

Founded in 2000, DRUM's membership of over 3,000 adults, youth, and families is multigenerational and represents the diaspora of the South Asian communities – Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Guyana, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, and beyond. In over a decade, they have built a model of South Asian and Indo-Caribbean undocumented workers, women, and youth led organizing for rights and justice from the local to the global. Their long-term vision is to build the power of immigrant workers in the U.S in unity with all workers and communities for human rights. They see movements for justice in the U.S. as rooted in working in solidarity with people of the Global South for just global trade, economic, and foreign policies. Their Power and Safety website includes community resources, a community-organizing toolkit, community mutual aid funds, and testimonials documenting community members' experiences during COVID-19.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_87cfc1ab03052a0a73330d9f3697c7ce" level="file"><did><unittitle>#FTA4PH Partner Org Resource Survey</unittitle><origination label="Creator"><corpname

Contents</head><p>Free them All for Public Health, or #freethemall4publichealth, is a campaign that demands the release of incarcerated people. The campaign recognizes a longer-term goal of abolition; however, it calls for immediate reductions of prosecution, probation, and court monitoring; the release of people from jails; and the release of people from prisons as measures of reducing the spread of COVID-19. The campaign calls upon individuals to participate in "zaps," actions in which elected officials, and individuals associated with the Department of Corrections, are contacted en masse through phone calls, faxes, emails, and social media. This website documents not only the demands of Free Them All, but the demands of incarcerated people at three city jails. It also lists actions, provides resources on decarceration and abolition, and links to recent news related to COVID-19 and incarceration. #freethemall4publichealth is a parallel campaign with #CloseRikersNOW.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_a602afcffbc3866bd9e698d437e6d36b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Free Them All 4 Public Health Virtual Phone Banking Training

During the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, Samaritan's Purse - an evangelical organization led by Franklin Graham - constructed a field hospital in Central Park. Given the organization's stance on LGBTQIA issues; homophobic, transphobic, and Islamophobic statements made by Graham; and the organization's requirement that individuals working for Samaritan's Purse must be Christians who oppose same-sex marriage, the hospital was met with criticism by LGBTQIA leaders, progressive religious leaders, and elected officials. LGBTQIA organizations, and others, protested the field hospital, inclusive of this action taken by Reverend Billy, in which he raises a rainbow flag next to the hospital. In May of 2020, the field hospital discharged its patients and dismantled its tents.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f5f6a4acdf5d01321c8a87612e3ce636" level="file"><did><unittitle>COVID -19 Impact Project</unittitle><origination label="Creator"><persname rules="dacs" source="local">Thompson, John Henry</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname rules="dacs" source="local">Johnson, Shindy</persname></origination><unitdate datechar="Captured" normal="2023-07/2023-07">July 2023</unitdate><container id="aspace_9347ea5fa50a887ec2d729c942ad5f64" label="electronic records" type="Box">Electronic Records</container><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/14083/*/https://covid19impactproject.com/" xlink:role="external-link" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="COVID -19 Impact Project Archived Website" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>COVID -19 Impact Project Archived Website: July 2023</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1bee8c4751ede6bd4508b8f8fc452e56"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The COVID-19 Impact Project is a crowdsoured platform to contribute ideas, share personal stories, memorialize loved ones, and examine statistics relative to the collective COVID-19 experience.
