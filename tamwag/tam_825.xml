    <abstract id="aspace_05871c5a8993e0dfed887ecb1e629393">Founded in 1973, the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB) creates and supports community-controlled affordable housing in New York City. UHAB supports New Yorkers to acquire, rehabilitate, and manage their apartments. Their programs include providing loans to first-time home buyers; developing new affordable co-ops; and organizing tenants facing landlord harassment and neglect. UHAB has undertaken a long-running oral history program with residents of HDFC co-ops, a type of resident-controlled, cooperatively-owned, and permanently affordable housing unique to New York City. The Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB) Oral History Collection (dated 2018-2022) consists of electronic audio recordings, transcripts, and photographs created in the course of the UHAB oral history program with residents of HDFC co-ops. The oral history interviews and supplemental materials document an under-represented but influential housing rights movement, spanning four boroughs and thousands of homes from the 1970s to the present day. The oral history project seeks to preserve the voices and memories of HDFC residents so that they may be passed down to future generations of building residents, as well as educate the public on the value of this affordable housing model. The interviews cover topics such as governance, time management, and equity; the internal politics of running a co-op; rehabilitation and renovation of buildings; squats and squatters; family life in co-ops; challenges of working with city officials; the long-term effects of secure, stable housing; navigating generational and demographic changes; community and building maintenance; and the struggle to remain affordable in a financialized housing market. Co-ops like Umbrella House are featured; participants are also spread out across New York in neighborhoods like Harlem, Washington Heights, South Bronx, Lower East Side, and Brownsville. Interviews address race, immigration, and gentrification.</abstract>

The tenants formed a tenants union and took classes at 100 Gold Street and UHAB. They started cleaning up and maintaining the building, which they believe had a positive effect on the neighborhood.

Squatters moved into Umbrella House (so-called because residents needed to bring umbrellas inside due to the leaking roof) around 1988. Tauno describes the Lower East Side at this time as disinvested, with buildings on Avenue A burned down and drug use prevalent; however, these cracks were also opportunities for artists. Umbrella House self-managed and self-governed for a long time. Residents did major renovations like stabilizing the roof and stairs and installing new bathrooms, wiring, and gas, with help from UHAB. Residents created a collective garden on the roof that provides produce for everyone in the building. The building was intended to house artists and a diverse population. About three quarters of the building are still original residents, many of whom remain active in the community.</abstract><container id="aspace_e41fb33edfbf8a0c32c50d9342260146" label="electronic records" type="Box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_982898c017ea836776660a582cdaf3d2" parent="aspace_e41fb33edfbf8a0c32c50d9342260146" type="E-records">TW_TAM_825_ER_5</container><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/material-request-placeholder" xlink:role="electronic-records-reading-room" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Tauno Biltsted" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Tauno Biltsted</p></daodesc></dao></did></c><c id="aspace_a26b0231707d5f8b24e1e9d216c7878c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Theresa Lillian Reid</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/978360</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021-06-10/2021-06-10">2021-06-10</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_fae7cafee0c360b9a240f9e7cafa8c12">Theresa moved into the building in 1962, while the building still had a landlord, who was described as a community leader.

She emphasizes the value of growing up in a stable home in an expensive city that she observed other kids in middle-class households lacked. Daphne connects her co-op to a larger homesteading and affordable housing movement that has transformed her neighborhood of Manhattan Valley to a diverse and affordable enclave within the Upper West Side.</abstract><container id="aspace_8c2e6583f0208c365de486d6fe8256f5" label="electronic records" type="Box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_85c4229057e64e7f6103be372539a152" parent="aspace_8c2e6583f0208c365de486d6fe8256f5" type="E-records">TW_TAM_825_ER_11</container><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/material-request-placeholder" xlink:role="electronic-records-reading-room" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Daphne" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Daphne</p></daodesc></dao></did></c><c id="aspace_b3827797c6f8d208e9c5d56685897d3b" level="file"><did><unittitle>David Calvert and Stephanie Evans</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/978367</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021-10-02/2021-10-02">2021-10-02</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2d332fd8ba0d2fe5cb7cbd8e5d36c6ba">David and Stephanie are longtime residents who have stewarded their HDFC for four decades at the time of the interview.

She moved into her HDFC with her mother and her siblings as a child. The building shortly fell into foreclosure and was seized by the City. The City offered ownership to the residents for $250 per household. She credits living in an HDFC for making her life in New York affordable. She describes the dramatic changes the neighborhood has undergone from its disinvested and abandoned state in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of her neighbors are relatives, and her building has many seniors.

Diane helped homestead her building in 1980 through LESCAC (Lower East Side Catholic Area Conference), a now-defunct Catholic Charities organization. She, alongside other volunteers, worked on a sweat equity project rehabbing 11 buildings in the Lower East Side through LESAC's homesteading process. In return, they could buy into and own one of the units. The land on which the buildings stood was also turned into a community land trust, the RAIN Community Land Trust. The rehab process was grueling and dangerous but hardened her resolve to stay in New York and built a sense of interreliance with her neighbors. They finished the sweat equity process after five years, longer than initially expected. The building was initially self-managed but they encountered challenges. After LESAC went under, the co-op partnered with UHAB. Diane has served as the co-op board's secretary for many years. None of the original shareholders have sold their apartments.</abstract><container id="aspace_ef01fd3f410d1ae40f4b3f001cf893dd" label="electronic records" type="Box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_8230d918a185b84368d89cfecbbec24a" parent="aspace_ef01fd3f410d1ae40f4b3f001cf893dd" type="E-records">TW_TAM_825_ER_14</container><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/material-request-placeholder" xlink:role="electronic-records-reading-room" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Diane D.

He was immediately asked to serve on the board and brought in fresh energy and ambition.

This battle began when a crucial tax exemption - J51 - had expired without their knowledge, resulting in a steep and unaffordable jump in their taxes. Kianah and Ms. King led a massive legal effort to regain their building, seeking help from local council members, lawyers, and housing nonprofits along the way. King grew up in Brownsville and homesteaded the building with a group that included Kianah's mother. Many of the original homesteaders were biologically related. They moved into the building in 1983; the building has had a tight-knit and familial atmosphere ever since. Children grew up playing in the hallways and street; cook outs would regularly occur in the backyard. King has been president since the 1980s and plans to continue her tenure into her retirement, although Kianah, part of a younger generation who grew up in the building, now lives there with her partner and child and has since taken on more leadership.</abstract><container id="aspace_272a023549e3266c95068ccb19f40be8" label="electronic records" type="Box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_61832380eacee5ec4964e40bef95be30" parent="aspace_272a023549e3266c95068ccb19f40be8" type="E-records">TW_TAM_825_ER_19</container><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/material-request-placeholder" xlink:role="electronic-records-reading-room" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Kianah Adams, Earline King, Kayla" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Kianah Adams, Earline King, Kayla</p></daodesc></dao></did></c><c id="aspace_c32ad9a1371ac13f0e9ec9dad7f1c316" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ryan</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/978372</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2022-06-27/2022-06-27">2022-06-27</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_342409bfa224e127bdf00b61d7c2213f">Ryan is a younger shareholder who entered the building in Sugar Hill in 2009 and has served on the board intermittently ever since. He is part of a newer generation of residents taking on the responsibility and governance of the building from its original shareholders. In this interview Ryan discusses the challenge of maintaining affordable and primarily local residency in Sugar Hill, an iconic but disinvested neighborhood that has gentrified with the rest of Harlem in the past few decades. He emphasizes that the co-op is the only place that many shareholders can afford to live in Manhattan and that HDFCs must be a place of primary residence, not a place to sublet or a pied a terre. He credits the first generation of primarily women shareholders who formed and governed the co-op, and hopes to continue the sense of community into the future.</abstract><container id="aspace_129e82686a5f4bdde9306608c16b4709" label="electronic records" type="Box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_1e9dea44aaa787b836ea2be6436df2d8" parent="aspace_129e82686a5f4bdde9306608c16b4709" type="E-records">TW_TAM_825_ER_16</container><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/material-request-placeholder" xlink:role="electronic-records-reading-room" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Ryan Duncan" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Ryan Duncan</p></daodesc></dao></did></c><c id="aspace_e6ae10b3b5211710869dbe109d4205cf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clarence Grier</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/978373</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2022-07-06/2022-07-06">2022-07-06</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_312b6adb86abcc9ac0f2bc62b249a10d">Clarence Grier has lived in his building for over fifty years.

The building was taken over by the City and managed by a private company. The tenants formed a tenants association, which Clarence became a part of. In the 1990s, after conversations with HPD where he learned that the City wished to sell their property, he and other residents initiated the process of buying the building and converting it into an HDFC co-op.
