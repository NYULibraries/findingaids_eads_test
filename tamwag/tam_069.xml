    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>William J. (William John) Fielding (1886-1974) was an author, editor, and sexologist. Born in New Jersey, he left school before completing the eighth grade and first worked in blast furnaces and then as a sandhog, boring tunnels under the Hudson River. In 1906, he decided to prepare for a clerical career rather than continuing hard manual labor. That same year, he enrolled in bookkeeping and accounting courses, and in 1909 was hired as secretary for the Tiffany Company. By 1913, Fielding had articles published in the <emph render="italic">New York Call</emph> and began taking classes at the Rand School of Social Science. He became interested in social problems and birth control and wrote a number of books and pamphlets on sexology and psychology, thirty of which were published over the years in the <emph render="italic">Little Blue Books</emph> series, including a thirteen-volume series, "Rational Sex" (Emanuel Haldeman-Julius, publisher). Fielding also published articles in <emph render="italic">The New York Call</emph>, the daily newspaper of the Socialist Party.  He served as editor and literary editor of the <emph render="italic">Newark Leader</emph> (1915-22), as editor of <emph render="italic">Know Thyself</emph> (1913-24), and was active in Socialist Party politics in New Jersey throughout the 1920s.

In 1942, Fielding was appointed secretary-treasurer of the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, and in 1946 he became a trustee.

<p>The papers contain correspondence; typescripts of Fielding's autobiography, <emph render="italic">All the Lives I Have Lived</emph>; essays, reviews, and poetry; and case histories from Fielding's work as a sexologist.

The correspondence series, which comprises the majority of the collection, concerns Fielding's work at Tiffany's; his interest in and work relating to sexology, psychology, free thought, and other social issues; and his personal reflections. Prominent correspondents include Harry Benjamin, Havelock Ellis, Andre Fridon, E. Haldeman-Julius, Joseph Lewis, Alfred Korzybski, Martin J. Martin, Madalyn Murray O'Hair, William J.

Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1912/1986" type="inclusive">1912-1986</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ad5d4e8a38dd4401294c73b870b8c8b8"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>The bulk of Series II: Correspondence consists of personal correspondence between Fielding and less famous colleagues, readers, researchers, and friends. In his later years, these provide summaries of his career that are more personal than his autobiography, including letters that describe Fielding's struggle with emphysema and arthritis and his wife's affliction with cerebral artereo-sclerosis. Fielding also had personal correspondence with well-known individuals like Upton Sinclair (1918-1928), John Haynes Holmes (1938), Ralph Bunche (1955) and J. W. Fulbright (1965). Scattered throughout is printed ephemera relating to sexology, psychology, and other matters.</p><p>This series also documents Fielding's participation in the American Social Hygiene Association, The American Birth Control League, the Eugenics Educational Society, the Society for Constructive Birth Control and Racial Progress, the Ethical Humanist Societies of Greater New York, the Freethinkers of America, and the Thomas Paine Foundation through correspondence with officials and members of these organizations. Among Fielding's correspondents in the Birth Control, Sexual Reform and Psychology movements between 1917 and 1972 were Drs. William J. Robinson, Harry Benjamin, Victor Robinson, Samuel Schmalhausen, and Andre Tridon. Other correspondents include Marie C. Stopes, Margaret Sanger, and Havelock Ellis. His relationship with Emanuel Haldmann-Julius, owner and editor of the <emph render="italic">Little Blue Books</emph>, is evident in correspondence with Haldmann-Julius, his family, and his biographers (1919-1973). Issues of free thought and rationalism are discussed in correspondence with Joseph Lewis (1923-1968), Alfred Korzybski (on general semantics and mathematical reasoning, 1921-1933), Martin J. Martin (1966-1971), and Madalyn Murray O'Hair (1969-1971). </p><p>Fielding's expertise in Tiffany artworks and the history of the Tiffany firm generated considerable correspondence with collectors and other parties interested in the authenticity of pieces and his own collection. Fielding's employment at Tiffany's also placed him in the position of ex-officio income tax consultant for the company's executives and for Emelia Tiffany. Letters from John D. Rockefeller (1922), Helen Keller (1928), and Barry Goldwater (1959) were acquired through his affiliation with Tiffany.</p><p>This series also includes a small number of photographs, likely removed from Fielding's personal correspondence.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref67" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1935/1969"
