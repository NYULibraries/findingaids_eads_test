      <physfacet>The album itself is in fair condition, but has suffered from woodworm at some point. The binding has broken, so the pages and covers are not connected. The fabric along the spine has been torn and displays some damage. The external covers are hand painted motifs with a central scene showing three human figures. The inside covers display large Farsi calligraphy. The external covers display scuffing. The back cover has a roughly 3cm by 5cm section missing. The internal pages are in good condition, but have some holes made by woodworm.

The photographs are in very good condition. They photos have not been glued to the album but have been attached with plastic corner tabs holding them down. Meaning the photos themselves are undamaged. Photos appear to have been protected from direct light and do not display unusual fading. No significant damage visible. Some photos display discolouration. </physfacet>

Photos depict protests and gatherings in April, May and June of 1951 at a time when the Iranian government was nationalising the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The newly elected Prime Minister Mosaddeq pushed through the nationalisation with huge local support. 

The album was sent to a student organisation in Myanmar and the final image is of two young buddhist boys.</abstract>
